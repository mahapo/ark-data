We weren't told

people the information.

Albrecht, Privacy Expert.

[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.412 --> 00:00:54.802 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Katherine,
good to see you.

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:56.427 align:middle line:84%
>> KATHERINE ALBRECHT:
Good to see you.

00:00:56.427 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Katherine has been
a long-time guest on "Coast

to Coast."

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.072 align:middle line:90%
You look wonderful.

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Thank you.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.321 align:middle line:90%
You look pretty good, yourself.

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.614 align:middle line:90%
And it's nice to see you on TV.

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:07.072 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's
different, isn't it?

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: It is, on camera.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.776 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm going
to tell you a story.

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Katherine if
it was OK to mention this,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very private
issue with a person who

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:90%
deals with privacy.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Katherine is a breast
cancer survivor.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:90%
She fought it, she beat it!

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.684 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And here she is.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.590 align:middle line:84%
When that first happened to you,
how did you find out about it?

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: It was at
Christmas time, 2010.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.767 align:middle line:84%
And I started feeling just
pain, like a pencil stabbing me

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:90%
in the breast.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is that?

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was Christmas, so
I just kind of thought,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
think about this much.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I had lost family
members to breast cancer,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
so it was the last thing I
wanted to actually think about.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
As I began to get
a little concerned,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I did notice that
there was a lump.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women have
kind of lumpiness.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of being a woman.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
anything of it.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:90%
I went to see my doctor.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was during the
exam that she said,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:90%
I think you need a mammogram.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And she got that white
look on her face.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.861 align:middle line:84%
And that was when my
world began to crash.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:09.736 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I remember when we went to
lunch in LA several years ago,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and you look as good
now as you did then.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But when Tom told
me, my producer,

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
that you had breast
cancer, and that you

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
needed to take a little
time to find yourself

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and to heal yourself,
and that you couldn't

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
be on "Coast to Coast,"
I was mortified.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:90%
I was in shock.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.222 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, how could this
person, who is so vibrant,

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:84%
come down with
something like that?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:90%
It could happen to anybody.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: It can
happen to anyone.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.225 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that was
so shocking about it

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:84%
was, that by the
time I found it,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, if you
get regular screening,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
you can find it when it's just
a little size of a pin head,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:84%
literally, they can
find it these days.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:90%
I had not been in for a screen.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.290 align:middle line:84%
They're saying now 45
is the age to do it.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't hit 45, so I
hadn't done my screen yet.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we
found it, I kid you

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:90%
not, it was the size of a mouse.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.442 align:middle line:90%
So imagine something that huge.

00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And typically, when
they find a cancer that's that

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
large, it's already spread
to the lungs, the liver,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:90%
the brain, the bones.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:90%
And then its terminal.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So there were a scary
couple of weeks in there,

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:90%
when we ran every lab test.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I had bone scans.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.485 align:middle line:90%
I had CAT scans.

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:90%
I had liver scans.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I had lung scans.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I went through the
whole nine yards.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And after every one,
even the doctors,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:84%
they were all treating
me like a dead women.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:90%
It really was--

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They give up.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: -- a
horrifying experience.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.741 align:middle line:84%
I had a receptionist come
around during one of my tests,

00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:84%
come around from the desk
with tears in her eyes

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:90%
and give me a hug.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So they definitely
were expecting

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that it was not
going to be curable.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A couple of months
ago, Katherine, my niece,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
my sister's daughter,
was talking to my sister.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And she called her
father, my brother-in-law,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and said, "Dad, you
need to get home.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
There's something
wrong with Mom."

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "What do you mean?"

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
She said, "She's just
not acting right."

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
By the time he got home,
which was within 30 minutes

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.335 align:middle line:84%
after that phone
call, they found

00:04:05.335 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:90%
her collapsed on the floor.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Had no idea what
was wrong with her.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
She had cut her
head, after falling.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:90%
They rushed her to the hospital.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And they found a tumor the size
of a golf ball in her brain.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:90%
And they operated on it.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:84%
She went through the
chemo and the radiation.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I, as you know, Katherine,
I'm a naturalist.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted her
to be on turmeric,

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and all these
other great things.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:90%
But she won't do that.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But she's going through those
stages that you went through.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:90%
But she's got Stage IV.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's tough.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:90%
And her attitude has changed.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.884 align:middle line:84%
How important was your attitude
when you defeated this?

00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: You know, I
almost think that's a myth.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get cancer
of any kind, it's depressing.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:84%
You will have
moments when you just

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.577 align:middle line:90%
say, God, how did this happen?

00:04:53.577 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
You'll have moments when
you won't get out of bed.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
You'll have moments when
you'll spend, I mean,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.860 align:middle line:84%
days that you'll
spend just crying.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's an added guilt,
if you begin to think,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:90%
my attitude has to be wonderful.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I have to be cheerful,
I have to be happy.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm making myself worse.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:90%
And then it's a cycle.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And what they're finding is,
there is an attitude component,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
because the attitude
has to deal with what

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.344 align:middle line:90%
you do to make yourself better.

00:05:16.344 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you get too depressed
to go to your treatment,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
you get too depressed to
look at the supplements

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and do the things that you
need to do, then clearly

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:90%
a bad attitude.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are some women
who say, I have breast cancer,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.496 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to keep living.

00:05:27.496 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:90%
And they throw in the towel.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, that's
the wrong attitude.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want women to
beat themselves up if they

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
do have discouragement
going through this horrible

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I have never
talked to a privacy expert who

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
knows as much as you
do about privacy.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.231 align:middle line:90%
So we expect to have you around.

00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Absolutely.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.521 align:middle line:90%
Well, I expect to stick around.

00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And just to give
you the update, I

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
did go through-- my doctor
who is at Dana Farber,

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:84%
tells me that I had more
chemotherapy than anyone

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:90%
she's ever treated.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
She gave me more
treatment and more, just

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.191 align:middle line:90%
the whole nine yards.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They
pelted you with this.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because
I was Stage III C,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.850 align:middle line:84%
right on the cliff of
going into Stage IV.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And that means three different
kinds of chemotherapy.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:84%
That means lots of
surgery, and a mastectomy.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
The radiation, I had 33
radiation treatments.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:90%
So I've been through the mill.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And the reason, I think,
that I've done so well

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:84%
is because of all
of the things I've

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.818 align:middle line:84%
learned from "Coast,"
all the things I've

00:06:19.818 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
learned from my own research,
of how you can actually

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.836 align:middle line:84%
do the standard therapies of
chemotherapy and radiation,

00:06:25.836 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
without which, I
think, my chances were

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
like 96% of being dead
within 5 to 10 years.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And now my chances are
like vastly improved,

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.554 align:middle line:84%
because I've done
the standard therapy.

00:06:35.554 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The reason people don't
want to do it, though,

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
is they're afraid-- I'm
going to lose my hair,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.987 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to lose my energy,
the chemotherapy is poison.

00:06:42.987 --> 00:06:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So you kind of go through
this whole process

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
of realizing, yes, but if
I've got an enemy force that's

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:84%
taken over my body,
it's almost like

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle line:84%
when the Nazis took over
Poland, over Warsaw.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
When the Allies wanted
to come and rescue

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:84%
the people in
Warsaw, they couldn't

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
go in with all kinds of
gifts and lovely things,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:84%
because the Nazis
would just take it.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So you really have to go
in and almost carpet bomb.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.435 align:middle line:90%
It's a crazy thought.

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard when
you are the one who's

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:90%
being carpet bombed.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:90%
But you have to kill the cancer.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And the key, during
that process,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:84%
is really to figure out how do I
protect myself in that process,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have any additional
symptoms from the chemotherapy?

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
turmeric comes in.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
The curcumin, which is the
active ingredient in there.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.060 align:middle line:84%
That's where the Coriolis
mushroom from mushroom science

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
That's where Risperdal, which
is wonderful for radiation-- I

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.235 align:middle line:84%
had the exact perfect
response to the radiation.

00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:35.367 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women get
blisters and it's awful.

00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:36.450 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any of that.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's, as you do it, you
don't want to throw the baby out

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
with the bath water,
which is what my aunt did.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.090 align:middle line:84%
She went the total
natural route.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And breast cancer,
by the time she

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
died she had multiple
tumors in her brain.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was a horrible,
horrible agonizing end.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.715 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I know enough
to know that there

00:07:53.715 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:90%
are natural solutions.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to find them.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
My husband and I have
come up with a regimen.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.202 align:middle line:90%
I take 30 different pills a day.

00:08:00.202 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, you're like me.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.284 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: I'm on all
kinds of supplements.

00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:90%
It's all natural.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And bless my husband's
heart, he, every day,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.120 align:middle line:84%
prepares me what
we call the pill

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
cocktail, from a whole variety
of turmeric and everything

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And as Charlie Sheen
would say, you are winning.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.718 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: I am winning.

00:08:15.718 --> 00:08:16.196 align:middle line:90%
I'm winning.

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:17.154 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good for you.

00:08:17.154 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Katherine Albrecht.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did you get
interested in privacy issues?

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.102 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:08:24.102 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: You know, that's
kind of an interesting story.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1999, I was a
graduate student at Harvard.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I was working on totally
unrelated research.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And my local Safeway
supermarket in California

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:84%
introduced to the
Safeway Rewards Card.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And I
said, what it this?

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed
store after store

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.686 align:middle line:90%
was introducing these things.

00:08:43.686 --> 00:08:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I did a little
research, I looked into it,

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I said, why would they, you
know, there's already sales.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't need a
card to get sales.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered
that what they were doing

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:84%
was using the numbers on there
to create an enormous database

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
of information about
what people buy.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What you buy, where
you're going, when you come in.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: When you come in,
and now what they can do is,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.018 align:middle line:84%
they can take it
to the next level.

00:09:02.018 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the supermarkets now,
including Safeway, especially,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and some of the supermarkets
on the East Coast,

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
have now purchased
these records that

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
tell you what's in
all the food you buy.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So they can actually pinpoint
an individual customer's health

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
predictions on the basis
of how much preservatives

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
you're eating, how many
green leafy vegetables.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.839 align:middle line:84%
They can break it down into
how many calories per adult

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
or per person in your
household you're consuming,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and make predictions whether
you have an obesity issue.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.526 align:middle line:84%
They can tell if
you're on a diet.

00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:90%
If you have dandruff.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.942 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's crazy
what they can tell.

00:09:32.942 --> 00:09:34.899 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do they
do with the information?

00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, they've
been using it for marketing

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:90%
purposes.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And the idea,
ultimately, for stores,

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
is that there no longer
will even be price tags.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
See JC Penney's is
working on this.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:84%
When we get into RFID I
want to talk about that.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that
the store of the future,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
you will walk in with your
portable handheld device,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
a cellphone, whatever it is,
you'll aim it at the shelf,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get a unique
price specific to you.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Think about when you
fly in the airplane.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.477 align:middle line:84%
You know, you and I
can both reserve--

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:84%
we can be sitting next to
each other on the same flight,

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.584 align:middle line:90%
and you paid $800.

00:10:04.584 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I would love
to do that, by the way.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Let's got for it.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.056 align:middle line:84%
So you would pay $800
and I'd pay $300.

00:10:10.056 --> 00:10:11.556 align:middle line:84%
And you'd say, how
is that possible?

00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's not fair.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.936 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Right, because they
do the individual pricing based

00:10:14.936 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle line:84%
on when you bought it, based
on what time you called,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.256 align:middle line:90%
based on even your previous--

00:10:19.256 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.517 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have flown
with us 50 times.

00:10:21.517 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: That's right.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.854 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they want
to do in the stores.

00:10:24.854 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And the supermarket cards,
or the "loyalty cards,"

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:90%
isn't that a terrible name?

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:84%
"Loyalty cards," they
were the beginning

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
of that to set up the
infrastructure so that all

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:84%
of the cash registers
now have the ability

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
to do unique individual pricing
for each individual person.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So eventually they want to RFID
tag everything in the store,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:90%
so it's all remotely readable.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.060 align:middle line:84%
They want those price
tags to, literally, change

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.323 align:middle line:84%
So if it's 10 o'clock at
night, and all the other stores

00:10:50.323 --> 00:10:51.669 align:middle line:90%
are closed, the price is double.

00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's the week
before Christmas,

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and they know you're in
a hurry, all of a sudden

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
the prices go up.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And they can just do
this in real time.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: These tags that they
have been putting in clothes

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.487 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
where do they get them?

00:11:05.487 --> 00:11:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Where are they made?

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Are they made here
in this country?

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Are they made in China?

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: They're
made all over the world.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:84%
It's been a huge-- it's really
the third world countries that

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.869 align:middle line:84%
have paid the price for
this, environmentally.

00:11:15.869 --> 00:11:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things
that rarely gets talked

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
about with RFID is, these
things contain heavy metal.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.794 align:middle line:84%
In RFID tags, the
microchip, which

00:11:22.794 --> 00:11:24.085 align:middle line:90%
has to be processed somewhere--

00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And how big are they?

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: The microchips are
the size of a speck of dust,

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:90%
nowadays.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.289 align:middle line:90%
They're really, really small.

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:29.913 align:middle line:84%
But you don't need
to worry about that,

00:11:29.913 --> 00:11:32.065 align:middle line:84%
because without an
antenna, it can't transmit.

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:34.412 align:middle line:84%
So the antennas can be like
the ones on a credit card.

00:11:34.412 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
They go all the way around
the edge of a credit card.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.162 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:11:37.162 --> 00:11:38.869 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: But in
order to create them,

00:11:38.869 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:90%
they put the metal on.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.561 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I thought
that was a design.

00:11:41.561 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well,
they etch it off.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:90%
They actually etch it away.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.694 align:middle line:84%
And then they wash that liquid,
full of all those heavy metals,

00:11:46.694 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
which is winding up
in lakes and streams

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and polluting the water supply
in a lot of these third world

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:50.780 align:middle line:90%
countries.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.593 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And then, not
to mention what it does

00:11:53.593 --> 00:11:55.180 align:middle line:90%
to the recycling stream.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Because, if you
take an RFID-- I'll

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
give you an example--
if you take plastic

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.609 align:middle line:90%
and you recycle it.

00:12:00.609 --> 00:12:02.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all watch
the numbers, the six

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:90%
and the eight and the four.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
If it has an RFID
tag in the plastic,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
it degrades it, just
having that tag in there,

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
so that the plastic is
no longer recyclable.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And it turns plastic,
in the recycling stream,

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.466 align:middle line:84%
into what they call
park bench plastic.

00:12:14.466 --> 00:12:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Which is the plastic that
can't be used for anything else

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:84%
but making park benches,
because it's so degraded.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now how would you
company that's recycling,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:90%
how would they even know this?

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.925 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well,
they wouldn't.

00:12:23.925 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the dirty
little secrets of RFID.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
The other thing it
does is cardboard,

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.120 align:middle line:84%
because when you put
the cardboard through,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:84%
you get it wet, and you
turn it into a pulp,

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and then you do all
these things with it.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But now it's full
of heavy metals

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:90%
from all the RFID antennas.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they're finding
that even recycling paper,

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:84%
that it's turning the
paper into toxic paper

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:90%
through the recycling.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What will they do
with the information, Katherine?

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So they've got these
little chips in everything.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into chips
in people in a moment.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.872 align:middle line:84%
But what will they do
with these product chips?

00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
What do they want
to get from that?

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, will it follow
you outside the store?

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Will it show you where you live?

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:90%
What will happen?

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.994 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, the idea
is, there are multiple people

00:13:03.994 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:90%
within retail who want this.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The people on the
supply chain side,

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.966 align:middle line:84%
because we're bringing in
all of this junk from China,

00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
they want to be
able to track it.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these big ships
and warehouses and trucks

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and we're shipping
things in from overseas,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:90%
and it's getting lost.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So they want the ability to walk
into a warehouse with a reader

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:90%
and instantly know what's in it.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Or to put doorways, so
that as the forklift comes

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
in with a pallet of products,
they know exactly where it is.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Once it's on the
shelf, they want it

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.492 align:middle line:84%
so that they can tell how
many pairs of underwear

00:13:30.492 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:90%
are on the shelf.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.402 align:middle line:84%
So that when they get
down to having zero pairs,

00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:35.110 align:middle line:84%
they'll know to go
and restock the shelf.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or in case
someone stole one, right?

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah, right.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.252 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which I may be wearing
right now, you never know.

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, that's what
they were doing with a razor

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
blades at Gillette, is they
actually set up that picture

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.672 align:middle line:84%
taking shelf that we revealed,
probably 10 years ago now.

00:13:50.672 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But they actually set
up a hidden camera,

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.879 align:middle line:84%
and they would take a picture
of every person in the Walmart

00:13:54.879 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
store who picked up the package
of Gillette razor blades.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:84%
They would take a literal
mug shot of every customer

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:84%
in the store, because
they were suspecting

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
every single person
of being a shoplifter.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.652 align:middle line:84%
So that's another reason,
to prevent shoplifting.

00:14:07.652 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
But then, once you
get beyond that,

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:84%
that's when it begins
to get very disturbing.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Because once the
supply chain people

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that are managing
inventory, once they

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
put it on to make
their jobs easier,

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:84%
then they shift
the burden onto us.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And what winds up happening
is you've got researchers

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:84%
at all kinds of universities
all over the world

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
now looking and
saying, well hang on,

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:84%
once the coffee
cups and the papers

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and the shoes and
everything have RFID tags,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:90%
look what we can do.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.210 align:middle line:84%
We can put readers
in the carpet.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:84%
We can put readers
in people's homes.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.150 align:middle line:84%
which people may know
from PBS, they actually

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
just recently sponsored a
big health care conference.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
their president said

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.135 align:middle line:84%
is that she looks
forward to the day

00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:84%
that she can monitor the health
of her patients in real time

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:84%
by watching what they
do in their homes.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: While
they're doing it.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.843 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: With
the tagged products,

00:14:56.843 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:90%
while they're doing it.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Intantly.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: So monitoring
your health by telling,

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.575 align:middle line:84%
are you moving a
little more slowly,

00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:02.909 align:middle line:90%
you drinking too much coffee.

00:15:02.909 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:90%
You hit the coffee.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You might
get a phone call.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: It's crazy.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.835 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What are you doing?

00:15:05.835 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: It's crazy.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Speaking of
calls, which we do on "Coast

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:84%
to Coast," we also, with
our live audience here,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:84%
with "Beyond Belief," we'll
take questions for Katherine.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:90%
So let's start a few right now.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Who's up first?

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to ask Katherine
Albrecht a question?

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Eventually, do you
feel that with RFID tracking

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
for foods, the insurance
companies will ask

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.910 align:middle line:84%
their clientele to pay
different prices in premiums,

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:90%
based upon what they eat?

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: It's already
happening with the loyalty

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:90%
cards.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Safeway actually has a
program for its employees,

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's a huge corporation, one
of the biggest in the country,

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Safeway has a program
where their employees have

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:90%
two different insurance rates.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:84%
One if they agree to allow
Safeway to monitor all

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:84%
of their purchases of food,
and one if they don't.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's already happening.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in New
England, Stop & Shop,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.469 align:middle line:84%
which is our biggest chain,
I actually spoke to their VP.

00:15:55.469 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why are you
investing in all of this?

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.051 align:middle line:84%
How can this possibly
make you money?

00:15:59.051 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:84%
It costs a fortune to
do all of this tracking.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, well we're looking
to recoup our investment

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.736 align:middle line:84%
by sharing the
information with HMOs.

00:16:07.736 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What ever
happened to the old days,

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
when they didn't
have any of this?

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.997 align:middle line:90%
We got by.

00:16:11.997 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: I know.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We existed.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.020 align:middle line:90%
We sold products.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:90%
They restocked.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we go
back to those days?

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.149 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, you know, I
wonder this about everything,

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:21.847 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:24.180 align:middle line:84%
My health club, I live in the
safest part of New England

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:90%
you could never live in.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I live in New Hampshire,
where there's no crime.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.079 align:middle line:90%
And I just had surgery.

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And after my surgery went
back to the health club, just

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
last week, and they've
installed surveillance cameras.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The big, you know, that
fish eye in the sky.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, has there been a
single crime at this facility?

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Is there a single reason
why they had to do that?

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And yet every 20 feet, all
up and down the hallways now,

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.815 align:middle line:84%
are these eyes in
the sky watching us.

00:16:50.815 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Everywhere.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.898 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: So, yeah, what
happened to the old days?

00:16:53.898 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:90%
We did get by OK.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, all
of this technology

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:84%
is not solving
the crime problem.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:90%
It's having no impact on that.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not at all.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: No.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.004 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not at all.

00:17:01.004 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a few more
of your questions.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Will the chips
be implemented into small

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:90%
businesses?

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: That's
a good question.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I think what's going
to happen, Walmart

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
has really been driving
this since 2005.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The bar code for people
old enough to remember,

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.440 align:middle line:90%
it's not always been around.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.695 align:middle line:84%
It was 1984, and I'm
sure Orwell is rolling

00:17:20.695 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:84%
in his grave over this, when
Walmart issued a mandate to all

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:84%
of its suppliers
and said, if you

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
don't put bar codes
on your products,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.585 align:middle line:90%
we won't carry them any longer.

00:17:30.585 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think what's going to
wind up happening is in,

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
2005, well, already, Walmart
said to its suppliers,

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:84%
you're going to need to put
the RFID tags on the crates

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and pallets, the
warehouse level stuff that

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%
comes into our warehouses.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And now you see stores like
JC Penney's, Macy's, Walmart,

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.380 align:middle line:84%
now do you see them getting
down to the individual level

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.157 align:middle line:84%
tagging of the
things that you buy,

00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I think the small
businesses are going

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:84%
to be participating in the same
way they participate in the bar

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:90%
code system.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
They didn't derive it,
but given that it's there,

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.619 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a part of
the retail landscape.

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Katherine, I remember
going to the store with

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:84%
my mother, to the supermarket,
I'm a little kid, eight,

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.460 align:middle line:90%
nine years old.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:90%
There were no bar codes.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And the cashier did
everything by hand.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So we bought a tomato,
it would be $0.25.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:84%
If we bought this,
they'd do-- and I

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
do have to admit that, nowadays,
with so many people always

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
waiting in line, it's
somewhat convenient

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:90%
to just go beep, beep, beep.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.669 align:middle line:84%
Does this have
any pluses at all?

00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, I think
once you start talking about

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:84%
the advantages for
efficiency, you have to look

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:90%
at the downsides for humanity.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Because it would be much more
efficient for me, as a school

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
teacher, for example, or
as a Sunday school teacher,

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.215 align:middle line:84%
to just have my kids press their
fingers to a fingerprint reader

00:18:48.215 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:84%
as they walk in the
door, or do an iris scan.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.002 align:middle line:84%
Or better yet, why don't we
just microchip implant them,

00:18:53.002 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and then when they walk through
the door, beep, beep, beep,

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
we know where the kids are, and
we know who's in the classroom.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, so
chips in everybody.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So if your only
value in a society

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
is convenience or cost
savings, and we throw away

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
all of the social aspects of
what it is to be human beings

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and interact with one
another, then you're

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.349 align:middle line:84%
going to get a world
where everybody

00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:90%
is staring into their devices.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.952 align:middle line:84%
Where, when you go to the
store, nobody greets you,

00:19:16.952 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
computerized, and you're

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.940 align:middle line:90%
checking out your own stuff.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.312 align:middle line:84%
And then you go home, and then
you get on your device again.

00:19:23.312 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're not even
interacting with each other.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I'm not even
going to go to the store.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to send my
robot into the store

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:90%
to go shopping for me.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And you know, the
place that this shows up most

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
is in the maternity wards,
because they're doing,

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
the VeriChip Corporation,
that makes the implant,

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.882 align:middle line:84%
has actually got a product
that they call Xmark.

00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is that?

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.381 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Isn't
that a great name?

00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:47.132 align:middle line:84%
Xmark is the ankle bracelet
that they put on newborn babies.

00:19:47.132 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And they sold it to
Stanley Works up in Canada.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.715 align:middle line:84%
So they don't own it any longer,
but they developed this thing.

00:19:51.715 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And now it's being
implemented in hospitals

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
finding is that, you

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.389 align:middle line:84%
would think that the
little ankle bracelet would

00:19:58.389 --> 00:20:00.134 align:middle line:84%
keep the abductions
from happening.

00:20:00.134 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
finding that it's

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
the impersonal nature of just
sticking a microchip tracking

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:84%
device on a kid that's making
those hospitals less safe.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're having
more abductions.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good point.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
chips in a moment.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.191 align:middle line:84%
Katherine Albrecht, our guest,
right here on "Beyond Belief."

00:20:15.191 --> 00:20:17.546 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:17.546 --> 00:20:30.666 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief"

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.710 align:middle line:84%
with our special guest
Katherine Albrecht.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Chips inside of people,
how real is this?

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, it's not
in the Obamacare Legislation,

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:84%
let me lay that to
rest, first of all.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: People thought it was.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:44.441 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They did.

00:20:44.441 --> 00:20:45.527 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Was it ever?

00:20:45.527 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Even yesterday,
somebody posted a new video

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.216 align:middle line:90%
saying that it's in there.

00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So it's not in there?

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.355 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: It's not in there.

00:20:50.355 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
There was an earlier version
of the bill that didn't pass,

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that was briefly
floated around that

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
had a provision for
implantable devices

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.599 align:middle line:84%
like pacemakers and
breast implants.

00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
That said that they wanted
to create a registry so they

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.265 align:middle line:84%
can tell if those things are
causing health problems down

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:90%
the road.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got to
say, if they did do

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:84%
that, I'd probably
embrace that idea.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we know the implantable
microchips cause cancer

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:90%
in laboratory animals.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And so if they are implanting
these devices into people,

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and the FDA approved it in
2005, so if they are implanting

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:84%
microchips into
people, I wouldn't

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:84%
mind there being a registry,
so that they can actually

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:28.359 align:middle line:84%
follow up and monitor whether
they are causing cancer.

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I would
want the Federal

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Government to be
running that registry.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.000 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly think
that people voluntarily

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.105 align:middle line:84%
may want to say, hey,
have a microchip in me,

00:21:36.105 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to be able to
have somebody monitoring

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:84%
it to see if it's
causing cancer.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.731 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The cancer is
at the point of insertion

00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:90%
in the animal?

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: It is.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:84%
What they originally
found is, when

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:84%
they put these little glass
capsules into people--

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're about the
size of the Tic Tac,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:84%
maybe a skinny Tic
Tac-- when they put them

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
into people and
animals, they migrate.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.245 align:middle line:84%
It's like a torpedo that
tunnels through the flesh.

00:21:55.245 --> 00:21:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they had,
like, race horses

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
that they went into their
lungs and were harming them.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So what they did to prevent
the sliding around of the glass

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.170 align:middle line:84%
capsule, is they dipped it
in a little bit of plastic.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And the plastic causes the
body to kind of bind with it

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and bond with it and create
scar tissue around it.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that
that process is

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:90%
what's leading to the cancer.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Katherine,
I'm pretty spiritual.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And I really enjoy reading
stories in the Bible,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:84%
in Genesis, or the
Book of Revelation,

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.926 align:middle line:84%
and comparing it to real life
events just to see if, hey,

00:22:28.926 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:90%
how did they know this?

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:90%
This is too close.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Are the microchips the
sign of the beast, the 666?

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.722 align:middle line:84%
Where you have to have something
to buy goods and services?

00:22:41.722 --> 00:22:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: You know what's
so interesting in the research

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
that I do, and I am a Christian,
and I absolutely believe that

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:90%
the mark of the beast is real.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely believe
that it's coming.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And each generation has
had its development.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The thing that it did, to push
this a little bit further,

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:84%
1930s they introduced the
Social Security number and said,

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.417 align:middle line:90%
it will never be used for ID.

00:23:00.417 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Now trying even getting a phone
or gas turned on to your house

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:90%
without it.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.958 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
it for everything.

00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So they thought, and said, well,
it's the mark of the beast.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the folks in
the 1970s and '80s said,

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:90%
it's the bar code.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be the mark of
the beast, and they fought it.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.475 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or the
computer, right?

00:23:14.475 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Or the
computer, itself.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're looking at RFID.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
We do have, now,
the ability to take

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:84%
all these numbers that
we've assigned to people,

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and all of the infrastructure
that was created

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.500 align:middle line:84%
in the 1930s around
these numbers,

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and now take those numbers
and put them into people.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.279 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it was
ever going to happen.

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It was just from
one day to the next.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, boom!

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Coming down from the sky.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe up from the pit,
would be this technology.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It has to have its
steps and stages.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.864 align:middle line:84%
And RFID, most definitely, is
one of those steps and stages.

00:23:44.864 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Now when you talk about
the mark of the beast,

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.014 align:middle line:84%
it talks about needing a
number to buy and sell.

00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
buying and selling.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
with that right now.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I just saw an ad, yesterday,
for using your cell phone

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.332 align:middle line:84%
to make a payment to
someone for a broken window.

00:24:01.332 --> 00:24:02.331 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, it's huge.

00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:90%
It is amazing.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.688 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Yes.

00:24:03.688 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can transfer
money to your friends,

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:84%
to another one of your accounts,
just with your little smart

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:90%
phone.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Exactly.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
in the stores,

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
JC Penney's, which
I've mentioned already,

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.060 align:middle line:90%
their new CEO is from Apple.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And what he wants to do
is, literally, eliminate

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
the cashiers, put RFID tags
on every single item in the JC

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.304 align:middle line:84%
Penney store, and you have
to pay with your cell phone.

00:24:26.304 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:90%
There's no other way to pay.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.160 align:middle line:84%
They won't even
take cash anymore.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Now the good news
is, they've just

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.804 align:middle line:84%
lost like 60% of
their stock value

00:24:33.804 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
out of business,

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.315 align:middle line:84%
because his other policies
aren't working very well.

00:24:37.315 --> 00:24:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Retail is getting
killed by the internet right

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: It is.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.721 align:middle line:84%
But JC Penney's is getting
killed by Ron Johnson.

00:24:41.721 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's a whole other story.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, this move
towards buying and selling,

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.850 align:middle line:84%
using computer chips,
using this infrastructure,

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.237 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a mistake
that it's called the net.

00:24:54.237 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:90%
What is a net?

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: It's not a mistake
that it's called the web.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you're gonna
call it the web,

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.234 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask,
who is the spider?

00:25:01.234 --> 00:25:02.109 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ha, ha, ha.

00:25:02.109 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:90%
And is it a black widow spider?

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.363 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Indeed.

00:25:04.363 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:90%
And I think it is.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.285 align:middle line:84%
I believe that when the
beast of Revelation,

00:25:08.285 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
which is a world leader and
a religious leader, that when

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.980 align:middle line:84%
that beast arrives,
that that beast is

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:84%
going to use the web
that we've created

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:90%
to entrap all of humanity.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And already, there
are countries now,

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.800 align:middle line:84%
where you can't do a
transaction of over $2,000

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.830 align:middle line:84%
in cash without going to
jail for 5 to 15 years,

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
because they want all
transactions to be trackable.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow!

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Will there ever be a point
where you'll be at home,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and you'll say, I want this,
this, this, this, this,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:84%
this from my favorite
retail store.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And it will be waiting
for you when you show up

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to the shipping department,
and you just pick it up?

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.184 align:middle line:84%
You literally don't
even go into the store.

00:25:47.184 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: I'll do you
one better than that.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Amazon is experimenting
with same day delivery.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So you get on your smart device,
you punch in what you want,

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.632 align:middle line:84%
and that same day it
arrives, literally,

00:25:59.632 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:90%
on the doorstep of your home.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.965 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They've got a
distribution center nearby,

00:26:02.965 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and somebody
shelves the product.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you'll
pay for that, right?

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Extra shipping an handling.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.608 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And the
other thing, though,

00:26:10.608 --> 00:26:13.120 align:middle line:84%
is you won't have the ability
to make purchases anonymously.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:84%
See, this is why
cash is so important.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And I always say, cash,
use it or lose it.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.430 align:middle line:84%
If we don't start making
our purchases in cash,

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and I mean going to the
bank and withdrawing

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:84%
$200 to do your grocery
shopping, then they will say,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:90%
nobody cares about cash.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.562 align:middle line:90%
And cash will go away.

00:26:27.562 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, your
anonymity will go away.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
more important.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Because privacy is a
means, it's not an end.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Privacy is not a goal.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Privacy is a means to
control over your own life.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And once they
invade your privacy,

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:84%
once they say, just like
those workers at Safeway,

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:84%
you know, well,
now you can't just

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.200 align:middle line:84%
go buy that big
pot roast that you

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:90%
were going to have for dinner.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Because now you're thinking,
they're watching me.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
raise my insurance rates,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:54.850 align:middle line:90%
so now I can't buy that.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Now it's voluntary.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But once we move to a
national health care system

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.899 align:middle line:84%
where, I'm paying
for your health care

00:27:00.899 --> 00:27:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're paying
for my health care,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:84%
then I think we
will most definitely

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.440 align:middle line:84%
have a situation where
all of these records that

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.952 align:middle line:84%
are being created on food
are going to clamp down.

00:27:08.952 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
say, no, you can't

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.020 align:middle line:90%
buy that pot roast, period.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:12.969 align:middle line:90%
No matter what.

00:27:12.969 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody else
buys it for you,

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.922 align:middle line:84%
it'll have an RFID
tag in it that

00:27:15.922 --> 00:27:18.102 align:middle line:84%
will tell me who bought
it, and I scan your fridge.

00:27:18.102 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And that person and you
are both going to jail.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Try making
a deposit in the bank,

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and then go in to try to get
the cash out the next day.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:90%
It is red tape.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:27.930 align:middle line:90%
You mean, what?

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.770 align:middle line:84%
You want to take money
out of your account?

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And
it's your money.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And it's yours.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.528 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: It's your money.

00:27:32.528 --> 00:27:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So if they're
controlling the finances,

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.171 align:middle line:84%
you better believe
that they're going

00:27:36.171 --> 00:27:37.420 align:middle line:90%
to be controlling the food.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.746 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be controlling
the health care, as well.

00:27:39.746 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So you won't be able to
get access to these things.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.703 align:middle line:84%
See, that's why it's
wonderful to have cash.

00:27:43.703 --> 00:27:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I can walk in, in
Colorado, California, Utah,

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I can find a doctor.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Call him on my
cell phone and say,

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:90%
I need an emergency appointment.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Walk in and pay cash.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.060 align:middle line:84%
In the future, you won't
be able to do that.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There will
be no cash, one day.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.517 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, I'd like
to think we can hold onto it

00:27:57.517 --> 00:27:58.290 align:middle line:90%
a little longer, though.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.498 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Katherine, when
we come back in the moment,

00:28:00.498 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:84%
you have brought a machine
that can literally track credit

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:90%
cards.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.716 align:middle line:84%
I want you to tell
us a little bit

00:28:05.716 --> 00:28:07.229 align:middle line:90%
about that, when we come back.

00:28:07.229 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And also, real quickly,
mention a few of your websites,

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:90%
would you?

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah, The website
that people can go to, to learn

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:17.281 align:middle line:84%
about the cancer causing
microchips is chipmenot.com.

00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Chipmenot.com.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Chip me not.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's the little animals.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.650 align:middle line:84%
We feature all the animals
that have developed cancer

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
from their implantable
microchips.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:84%
My main website is my name,
katherinealbrecht.com.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And because I do a
daily radio show,

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.095 align:middle line:90%
you can go to kmashow.com.

00:28:32.095 --> 00:28:34.595 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, I'm a VP
with startpage.com, the world's

00:28:34.595 --> 00:28:35.920 align:middle line:90%
most private search engine.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We're going to go
back in just a moment on "Beyond

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.299 align:middle line:90%
Belief."

00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:84%
More with Katherine
Albrecht and your questions

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:84%
from our audience, right
here, on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.070 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:47.070 --> 00:29:01.845 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.845 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome back to
"Beyond Belief" with our guest,

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Katherine Albrecht.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.651 align:middle line:84%
Katherine, RFID chips, where
will people see this happen?

00:29:08.651 --> 00:29:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Where is it going to be?

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well,
let me tell you,

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:84%
if you want to tie it in
with the mark of the beast,

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:90%
here's the scary thing.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.990 align:middle line:84%
The number one place
that people are

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:84%
likely to find RFID is,
literally, in their own wallets

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, no.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.756 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And I'm betting
there's people in our viewing

00:29:21.756 --> 00:29:23.460 align:middle line:84%
audience, in the
studio audience, here,

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:84%
everywhere you go that
have these RFID tags,

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and don't even realize
they have them.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So what the credit card
companies have done

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:34.590 align:middle line:84%
is quietly embed RFID tags
that can be read at a distance,

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.825 align:middle line:90%
into people's credit cards.

00:29:35.825 --> 00:29:37.575 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You could
steal the information?

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:38.658 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Or ATM cards.

00:29:38.658 --> 00:29:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, here's the problem.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing about RFID,
RF is Radio Frequency.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.210 align:middle line:90%
These are radio waves.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
They travel through
walls, not only

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.980 align:middle line:84%
through your pocket
or your purse.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So one of the big
security problems

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.254 align:middle line:84%
here is not only
do they transmit

00:29:52.254 --> 00:29:53.670 align:middle line:84%
through your pocket
or your purse,

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:84%
but they actually
give the full credit

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.367 align:middle line:84%
card number in the clear
and the expiration date.

00:29:58.367 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, a lot of them
even give the full name

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:90%
of the credit card holder.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who can just brush
up near you, stand next to you

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.700 align:middle line:84%
on an elevator, or
in a crowded area,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
they can go boom, boom,
boom, boom, and literally

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.430 align:middle line:84%
collect hundreds of credit
card numbers just like that.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So if I'm a guy
and I see you at a party.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.100 align:middle line:90%
And I just want to meet you.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And you're about to scam me.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.192 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got one of these
devices, you can do that?

00:30:23.192 --> 00:30:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: I could
have it in my purse.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All right, let's
do a little reenactment.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.550 align:middle line:90%
You sit there.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.992 align:middle line:90%
Let's pretend you're at a party.

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: All right.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I want to
come up and meet you.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you I have
a credit card on me, OK.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:34.482 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: OK.

00:30:34.482 --> 00:30:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hey, hi, Katharine.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:36.993 align:middle line:90%
George Noory, how are you?

00:30:36.993 --> 00:30:37.366 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Hey, George.

00:30:37.366 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:90%
It's great to see you.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What's new?

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: How are you doing?

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Hey, things are going great.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I'm good.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Let me sit down, and we'll talk.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Now what did you just do?

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, you must have
a credit card in your pocket.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, I do.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: You do.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:48.030 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.488 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you
something about it.

00:30:49.488 --> 00:30:52.415 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that it's
number starts with 433.

00:30:52.415 --> 00:30:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And I can
tell that its number ends,

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.718 align:middle line:90%
hang on, let me look on here.

00:30:55.718 --> 00:30:57.515 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Don't give
my last four digits.

00:30:57.515 --> 00:30:59.815 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: It ends with 98.

00:30:59.815 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And it
expires on 11/14.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.390 align:middle line:90%
That's it, right here.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.604 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah.

00:31:06.604 --> 00:31:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And I can do that with
anybody in the audience

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:90%
who has one of these tags.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And off you
go shopping somewhere.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.295 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: There you go.

00:31:11.295 --> 00:31:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Maybe on the
internet, or whatever.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: That's all that I
need to log on to any website

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and order $10,000 worth
of electronics equipment.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Have it shipped to Eastern
Europe, unload it and voila,

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.680 align:middle line:90%
you just got scammed.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What are these credit
card companies doing now to try

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.610 align:middle line:90%
to fight this stuff?

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.535 align:middle line:90%
The fraud must be unbelievable.

00:31:29.535 --> 00:31:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Nothing.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:34.390 align:middle line:84%
This was first revealed in
2007 by researchers, Kevin Fu

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and Thomas Benjamin
at the University

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.290 align:middle line:90%
of Massachusetts in Amherst.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
them credit for this.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.540 align:middle line:90%
They revealed this.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.430 align:middle line:90%
It got lots of press.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And here we are, how
many years later?

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:90%
And it has not been fixed.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's no encryption
on these tags,

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:84%
because encryption
would cost money.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Encryption would be expensive.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So they put it together so that
it's readable in the clear.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Now that's bad enough
on your credit card.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:84%
You know that you
have a limit of $50

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:90%
if there's a fraudulent charge.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.651 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And if this
is my line of credit,

00:32:02.651 --> 00:32:06.040 align:middle line:84%
it's probably got a
limit of about $250.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: So there you've
got your limit on there,

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
but then the real
part that concerns me,

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.110 align:middle line:90%
is the border cards.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:18.460 align:middle line:84%
They're called epassport cards,
or enhanced driver's licenses.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who has one
of those, now this one

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.582 align:middle line:84%
I had to be about this
distance to read it.

00:32:22.582 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I could read it for your
pocket, through your wallet,

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:90%
with my purse.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But the epassport cards and
the enhanced driver's licenses,

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I could read from
down the block.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So if you're in a
crowd walking down a street

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:84%
in New York and you wanted
to steal this information,

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe you're a terrorist
and you want to get people

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.345 align:middle line:84%
in illegally, you can
capture stuff like that?

00:32:42.345 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Not only
can I capture it,

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:84%
but I can capture it
and within seconds,

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I can begin emitting the same
number and pretending to be

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.289 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:32:49.289 --> 00:32:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just like that?

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.496 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Just like that.

00:32:51.496 --> 00:32:53.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I did a demo for
the Michigan Legislature,

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:84%
where I went up to a
lawmaker and I pretended

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.014 align:middle line:84%
I was standing next to
her on the elevator,

00:32:59.014 --> 00:33:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and then I pushed a
button on my device,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and I beginning
emitting her number,

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I then walked over to her
office and I opened her door.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Was she in awe?

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.329 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: She was horrified.

00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Where is this headed?

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.802 align:middle line:90%
Where is this going?

00:33:11.802 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, I think
what's going to happen is,

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:17.180 align:middle line:84%
because the way it's being
implemented is so insecure--

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.910 align:middle line:84%
it's not a mistake, by the
way, that it's insecure-- we,

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
being all of the RFID experts,
and the RFID industry, itself,

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.130 align:middle line:84%
warned the State Department,
don't put these things

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:27.641 align:middle line:90%
into passport cards.

00:33:27.641 --> 00:33:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Don't put them into
border crossing cards.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.410 align:middle line:90%
They're not secure.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're so not
secure, that if this

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.240 align:middle line:84%
was my enhanced
driver's license--

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can I have that back?

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: I already know the
number, yeah, you can keep it.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to walk
into a Walmart store

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.930 align:middle line:84%
with an enhanced driver's
license in my purse,

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:84%
the Walmart underwear shelf
would read the number,

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and would read my personal
information off of it.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Shocking.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.013 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: So that's insecure.

00:33:52.013 --> 00:33:52.805 align:middle line:90%
And we warned them.

00:33:52.805 --> 00:33:55.150 align:middle line:84%
We said, whatever you do,
don't use the product tagging

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:84%
technology, use some new
encrypted special government

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.852 align:middle line:84%
technology, What are you
guys doing using standard,

00:34:00.852 --> 00:34:02.310 align:middle line:84%
in the clear,
readable stuff that's

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.809 align:middle line:84%
going to have readers in every
retail store in the country?

00:34:05.809 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they
did it on purpose.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:90%
They knew.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We testified, there's pages
of stuff that went to them.

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:12.679 align:middle line:84%
So what is ultimately
going to happen

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:15.690 align:middle line:84%
is that, when this becomes so
insecure that the public will

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:19.730 align:middle line:84%
begin clamoring, hey, they're
accessing all my information.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.124 align:middle line:90%
We need more security.

00:34:21.124 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Then they're going to
link it with biometrics.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going
to link it with your DNA.

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going
to be an implant.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.161 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And then you're gone.

00:34:27.161 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.043 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: That's right.

00:34:29.043 --> 00:34:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In Baltimore, they've
got cameras on buses now.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand a little
bit of that, for security.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:38.350 align:middle line:84%
People fight on buses
and get stabbed on buses.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But now they're recording
people's private conversations.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you and I were sitting
on a bus kind of whispering

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:90%
about things, they record it.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.645 align:middle line:90%
Why are they doing this?

00:34:49.645 --> 00:34:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: You know,
it gets back to that web

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.750 align:middle line:90%
and the spider.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.348 align:middle line:84%
And you can even take it
right back to the beast.

00:34:55.348 --> 00:34:57.480 align:middle line:84%
That what we are
building, thinking

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:84%
in the name of security and
efficiency and saving money,

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.460 align:middle line:84%
we are building the
body of the beast.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.770 align:middle line:84%
We've already put in place his
eyes, even in my health club.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And now were putting
in place his ears.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon,
those eyes and ears

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:90%
are going to be in your home.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be everywhere.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What about
red light cameras?

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Research has shown,
in some cities,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:90%
it's minimized accidents.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I've talked
to some experts who

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:90%
say they increase accidents.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:84%
That people are so
obsessed now about running

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.440 align:middle line:84%
through a yellow light that
they will hit, immediately,

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and they get rear ended.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: That's right.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.284 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are these
cameras here to stay?

00:35:35.284 --> 00:35:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: They
absolutely are here to stay.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's an enormous
infrastructure.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.590 align:middle line:84%
We actually wrote about
this in "Spy Chips"

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:44.450 align:middle line:84%
about how they have
entire command centers.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:84%
You remember in the movies, or
when they did the moon landing?

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And they had the
huge command center.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And you saw the
banks of cameras.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what they do with
all the traffic cameras.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.750 align:middle line:84%
They have banks of
cameras in these centers,

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
where they watch and observe
all of our movements.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And what it is, is it ties
in to knowing when you fly.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Now they've got this incredible
databases to do that.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.690 align:middle line:90%
To knowing when you travel.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're linking it up
with license plate readers

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.170 align:middle line:90%
and cameras now.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So that all of your vehicular
travel will be tracked,

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:14.130 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:84%
All the cabs in New York now
have RFID readers on board,

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.790 align:middle line:90%
literally, in cabs.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you get
into a cab, you're

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.850 align:middle line:84%
going to have to scan your chip
implant to even take a cab.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.627 align:middle line:84%
So they don't want
you traveling.

00:36:25.627 --> 00:36:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is,
one of the first things

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.876 align:middle line:84%
that Amnesty International
and all these groups that

00:36:29.876 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:84%
look at oppressive government
regimes, one of their things

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.610 align:middle line:84%
that they look at to see
how free is a people,

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:38.950 align:middle line:84%
is whether the government is
restricting and monitoring

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:39.632 align:middle line:90%
their travel.

00:36:39.632 --> 00:36:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And look at what's
happening to us.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it
through these technologies.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When I was 16
years old, 300 years ago,

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I got a Social Security
number and I was able to work.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to file my taxes
and I was able to get employed

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and to do all
these great things.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.240 align:middle line:90%
What happens with the chip?

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.570 align:middle line:84%
When they tell us,
folks, were doing away

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:06.130 align:middle line:84%
with these Social
Security cards.

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:84%
The number is going
to be on a chip.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.060 align:middle line:84%
All we want you to do
is go to your doctor

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and he will put a
little shot in your arm.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It won't hurt at all,
and you're all set.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you go
shopping, you just

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.730 align:middle line:84%
wave your hand right
over the old screener.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're going to
get a job, you just

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
wave it there for the Human
Resources Department person.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Are they force us,
that way, to get that?

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Because on the face of it, right
now, if they told me today,

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:90%
George, go get a chip.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:90%
My answer is absolutely no.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when they force
you to have to have it in order

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.825 align:middle line:84%
to get a job, like your
Social Security number?

00:37:46.825 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well, I think it's
not going to be our generation.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I think for this to be adopted
our generation is going

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to be a little too
mm, mm, no thank you.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But what worries
me are the kids.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:01.685 align:middle line:84%
Because they just had an event
called the Zombie Pub Crawl

00:38:01.685 --> 00:38:02.310 align:middle line:90%
in Minneapolis.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They sure did.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: 50,000
young people.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They loved it.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: In their teens and
20's, not only agreed to put

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.770 align:middle line:84%
an RFID wrist band on their
right hand that tracked them

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.370 align:middle line:84%
as they moved from
pub to pub to pub.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they
thought it was cool

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: They
dressed as zombies,

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.400 align:middle line:84%
they were dripping blood,
they thought it was cool.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:90%
50,000 people tracked with RFID.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.120 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the biggest RFID
trackings we've ever had.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.735 align:middle line:84%
Not only did those
young people, you

00:38:25.735 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:84%
would think young people
would say, heck, no.

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:28.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't want people tracking me.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:90%
I want to be free.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's like
the smart phone thing.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: It
was the opposite.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.700 align:middle line:90%
They were craving these things.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I want one.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:34.295 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah.

00:38:34.295 --> 00:38:36.545 align:middle line:84%
And then what they did to
make it even more compelling

00:38:36.545 --> 00:38:39.780 align:middle line:84%
is, they set up these big
kiosks that said Facebook.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And people would go
over and voluntarily

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.960 align:middle line:84%
press their wrist band,
their tracking wrist band up,

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.720 align:middle line:84%
to report to the internet, to
the global brain, to the net,

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.690 align:middle line:90%
to the spider, here I am.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.191 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I bet, if
they offered to implant,

00:38:53.191 --> 00:38:54.940 align:middle line:84%
most of those kids
would have had it done.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: That's
what scares me.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
number one place--

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.510 align:middle line:84%
because we stopped the
implanting of people

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.379 align:middle line:90%
with microchips.

00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:03.670 align:middle line:84%
We stopped it through the
Blue Cross/Blue Shield trial.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.600 align:middle line:90%
We got that stopped.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.600 align:middle line:84%
We stopped the chipping
of Alzheimer's patients.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.140 align:middle line:84%
That's my antichips.com
website, you

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:84%
can see all the
protests that we did

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:13.200 align:middle line:84%
to make that stop, and all the
research that we put together.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's been stopped
in all of those sort

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.160 align:middle line:90%
of formal, official places.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But where it's happening
now is in tattoo parlors,

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.600 align:middle line:84%
where people are literally
buying the microchip

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.850 align:middle line:84%
implants that are used
for veterinarians,

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.705 align:middle line:84%
and thinking it's cool to
put them into their hands.

00:39:27.705 --> 00:39:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, you're right.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the secret of this.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Make it fun and the
young people will do it.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:90%
This generation won't do it.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Folks in the
audience won't do it.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.130 align:middle line:90%
You won't do it.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:39.140 align:middle line:90%
I won't do it.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.660 align:middle line:84%
But the kids might,
because it's cool.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to happen
time and time again.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Well as, you well
know, we will also

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:84%
take some more questions
for Katherine Albrecht.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So just raise your hands for
me and we'll get right to you.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: In your opinion,
do you think that there is,

00:39:55.170 --> 00:40:00.294 align:middle line:84%
or will ever be, a benevolent
use for RFID technology?

00:40:00.294 --> 00:40:03.415 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: You know, there's
a great quote by C.P. Snow,

00:40:03.415 --> 00:40:06.040 align:middle line:84%
the "New York Times" writer that
we opened our book "Spy Chips"

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:06.540 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And it said, technology
is a queer thing.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.850 align:middle line:84%
It gives you great
gifts with one hand,

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and it stabs you in the
back with the other.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So I can say that
about pesticides.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I can say that about
genetically modifying foods.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I can say that about
modern health care.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.300 align:middle line:90%
I can say that about the car.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.110 align:middle line:90%
That it's great to have cars.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a bummer that we
have so much pollution.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.009 align:middle line:84%
So it really is that all of
these technologies, and that's

00:40:30.009 --> 00:40:32.550 align:middle line:84%
a whole other story about where
I think the technologies came

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.050 align:middle line:84%
from, because I
think they literally

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:36.000 align:middle line:90%
tie back to the Garden of Eden.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So all of these technologies
that we've been given,

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.950 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge of good and
evil is good and evil.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:42.680 align:middle line:90%
They're both.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.330 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you could use RFI-- if
we lived in a not fallen world,

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.700 align:middle line:84%
if we lived in a perfect
world, I wouldn't worry.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But we'll never
live in a perfect world.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: We won't.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you build these powerful,
powerful systems and structures

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:84%
in place for
control, somebody is

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.409 align:middle line:84%
going to step in and
use them for control.

00:40:59.409 --> 00:41:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who else would have
a question for Katherine?

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Here we go, right here.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: OK my question
is, does the aluminum wallet,

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.145 align:middle line:84%
will that help protect your
credit cards from that scanner?

00:41:09.145 --> 00:41:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, can you have
something that will insulate

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.120 align:middle line:90%
your credit cards?

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: You know, this is
the question people always ask

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:14.840 align:middle line:90%
me.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, yes, if you
surround them with aluminum,

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.290 align:middle line:90%
that it'll work.

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:26.987 align:middle line:84%
You can Start Page aluminum RFID
blocking wallet and duct tape,

00:41:26.987 --> 00:41:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually
learn how to make

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.680 align:middle line:90%
your own out of duct tape.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's true.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:34.807 align:middle line:84%
But I think what worries me is
that, when you've got a card,

00:41:34.807 --> 00:41:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and you have this
little symbol on it,

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and you know that it has RFID,
why would you want to knowingly

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.030 align:middle line:84%
have this be a part of
your financial world?

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Why would you want
this in your wallet?

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the
frustration for me is,

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I would love for every
single person in America

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to say to the credit card
companies, we will refuse,

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:84%
we'll close our accounts unless
you get this out of there.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.936 align:middle line:84%
But instead, it's kind of
like patching a little patch

00:41:58.936 --> 00:42:00.436 align:middle line:84%
onto the problem,
of well, I'll just

00:42:00.436 --> 00:42:02.700 align:middle line:84%
make sure nobody can read
it, and I guess it's OK.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's almost
like saying rape is OK,

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.910 align:middle line:90%
as long a you use a condom.

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:08.990 align:middle line:90%
It's never OK.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:10.720 align:middle line:84%
These technologies
are dangerous.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And they should not
be in our wallets.

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.996 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
you see, nowadays,

00:42:13.996 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Katherine people are so
excited just to get approved

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.890 align:middle line:84%
by a credit card company,
they're not going to call them

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.290 align:middle line:84%
back and say, I don't
want it, cancel it.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, things are tough
for a lot of people out there.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So if a credit card
company says, look,

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.609 align:middle line:84%
we're going to give you a
$1,000 monthly line of credit,

00:42:30.609 --> 00:42:31.650 align:middle line:90%
they would take the card.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many people look

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.426 align:middle line:90%
at the back of these things.

00:42:34.426 --> 00:42:36.921 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Even it they
had 100 people who said,

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to keep my account, I
want to keep my account number,

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.750 align:middle line:84%
just please reissue be a plastic
card that doesn't have this

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:42.260 align:middle line:90%
stuff in it.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.386 align:middle line:90%
I don't want it.

00:42:43.386 --> 00:42:44.260 align:middle line:90%
That would be enough.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So they would have
two different version.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.911 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let's take some more.

00:42:46.911 --> 00:42:47.835 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:42:47.835 --> 00:42:49.267 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: When
they put the chips--

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.975 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if they
implanted them in the high

00:42:52.975 --> 00:42:57.570 align:middle line:84%
school kids, or if it was
something they wore in Texas--

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.295 align:middle line:84%
are these little trial
balloons of, well,

00:42:59.295 --> 00:43:02.660 align:middle line:84%
lets see how far we can go
under the guise of we just want

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:84%
to see how they interact,
how flu spreads?

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.820 align:middle line:84%
That was the case that
they put those in the kids.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Is this just trying to
push this thing forward?

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.195 align:middle line:84%
Let's try this with
this excuse, et cetera?

00:43:14.195 --> 00:43:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's a
good test, isn't it?

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah, they're
really aiming for the kids.

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:21.152 align:middle line:84%
I think that they've given
up on our generation.

00:43:21.152 --> 00:43:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that they know that
we'll accept some things,

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and we're certainly
staring into our devices.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:26.866 align:middle line:84%
But they know that
we're not going

00:43:26.866 --> 00:43:29.860 align:middle line:84%
to accept that kind of
like full on tracking.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.360 align:middle line:84%
The kids, though,
on the other hand,

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.630 align:middle line:84%
if you've got a middle school
student who's in seventh grade,

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:35.005 align:middle line:84%
like down in San
Antonio, they're

00:43:35.005 --> 00:43:36.620 align:middle line:84%
doing the 7th
through 12th grade,

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.740 align:middle line:84%
they have to wear
active RFID tracking

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.499 align:middle line:84%
badges around their necks this
year as part of that pilot.

00:43:41.499 --> 00:43:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And those kids are being
tracked with the readers

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.206 align:middle line:84%
all over the ceiling
that are monitoring

00:43:45.206 --> 00:43:47.180 align:middle line:90%
their location all day long.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And those kids, you know, the
ones that are in 12th grade,

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.797 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
be decision makers.

00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:54.380 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
judges and lawyers

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.884 align:middle line:90%
and corporate executives.

00:43:55.884 --> 00:43:57.550 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
the next generation.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.250 align:middle line:84%
In like 10 or 15
years they're going

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:90%
to be making those decisions.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And when they are in
a position to say,

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:04.599 align:middle line:90%
how should the world look?

00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:06.140 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
say, well, of course

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.670 align:middle line:84%
it's going to have to involve
tracking of every person.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I grew up with it.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:10.984 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of society.

00:44:10.984 --> 00:44:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, I
think, right now,

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.120 align:middle line:84%
we have a window of
opportunity to stop

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.660 align:middle line:84%
the tracking of those
school kids in San Antonio.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's crucial
that we all join in to do it.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a pilot this year.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.780 align:middle line:84%
It's 4,200 kids,
one single pilot.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And if they get away with it
for this entire school year,

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.875 align:middle line:84%
they're going to roll
it out all across Texas.

00:44:27.875 --> 00:44:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are the
parents opposed to it?

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: A lot
of the parents are.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The kids may
not be, but the parents?

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.026 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: But see,
they picked a community,

00:44:33.026 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and this is what they always do,
they pick the disenfranchised.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.480 align:middle line:84%
They picked a community
where a lot of people

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:90%
don't speak English.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.155 align:middle line:84%
Some of them may not even
be in the country, legally.

00:44:42.155 --> 00:44:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're not even
aware of what these are.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: They're not in
any kind of position to go

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.285 align:middle line:84%
and argue and say I
don't agree with this,

00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:49.410 align:middle line:84%
because they want to bring
attention to themselves.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.006 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are
military families

00:44:51.006 --> 00:44:53.255 align:middle line:84%
where dad has been gone for
years over in Afghanistan,

00:44:53.255 --> 00:44:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and mom is doing
the best she can.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.720 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't have time to
fuss around with that.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.086 align:middle line:84%
And so when they say, hey,
do it or else, they're

00:44:59.086 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:84%
not going to go to the
school board meetings.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
power to do that.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, I
believe it's critical

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that we, who understand this
technology, who have access

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:11.500 align:middle line:84%
to television and radio, who
have the ear of the country,

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.850 align:middle line:84%
that we say no to
this now, because it's

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.170 align:middle line:84%
an awful lot easier to take
a fire extinguisher to one

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.194 align:middle line:84%
tree, than to 100
miles of forest.

00:45:19.194 --> 00:45:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Katherine Albrecht
is also a pretty accomplished

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:22.110 align:middle line:90%
author.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.520 align:middle line:84%
When we come back in just a
moment, on "Beyond Belief,"

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.650 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about her
work, "Spy Chips."

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:29.774 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:45:29.774 --> 00:45:46.526 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:46.526 --> 00:45:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief"

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.590 align:middle line:90%
with Katherine Albrecht.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:52.657 align:middle line:84%
She's also an accomplished
author, "Spy Chips."

00:45:52.657 --> 00:45:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember when you
were on "Coast to Coast"

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:58.892 align:middle line:84%
with me talking about this,
tremendous reviews on this.

00:45:58.892 --> 00:46:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It's all about your
work, isn't it?

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: It it.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.795 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's
interesting about this book is,

00:46:02.795 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:84%
when we wrote it, the RFID
industry was horrified,

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:07.419 align:middle line:84%
because we revealed
all their plans.

00:46:07.419 --> 00:46:09.210 align:middle line:84%
We said, here's what
Walmart's going to do.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:10.370 align:middle line:84%
They're taking
pictures of people.

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:11.786 align:middle line:84%
They're doing all
of these things.

00:46:11.786 --> 00:46:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to
say, oh, come on,

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.410 align:middle line:90%
that's just science fiction.

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:17.780 align:middle line:90%
That's all just imagination.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Here we are, just a
couple years later,

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:22.065 align:middle line:84%
and every single thing in
that book is happening.

00:46:22.065 --> 00:46:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Right down to do, do you guys
remember the Talking Plant?

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: We talked
about putting reader devices

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:30.730 align:middle line:84%
into the coffee maker, so you
could see what elderly people

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:31.430 align:middle line:90%
are doing.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.263 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
they're doing right now.

00:46:33.263 --> 00:46:35.500 align:middle line:84%
They're running trials of
that, where they actually

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.590 align:middle line:84%
have embedded RFID devices
into elderly people's homes.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:39.700 align:middle line:90%
And they're watching them.

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So everything we talked about
in the book is all coming true.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.050 align:middle line:84%
It's more true today than
it was when we wrote it.

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.912 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Katherine what
scares you about this?

00:46:47.912 --> 00:46:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Oh, my goodness.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.540 align:middle line:84%
What scares me, I
think, is the history.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
at the 20th century,

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.090 align:middle line:84%
the thing that killed people
was not random crimes.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
The thing that killed
people was government.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.820 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the
Soviet Union and Stalin,

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.300 align:middle line:90%
who killed 60 million people.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And the way he did it, was
by knowing who opposed him.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.870 align:middle line:84%
By watching everything, by
taking away people's privacy.

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:15.250 align:middle line:84%
You didn't know if your
neighbor was an informant.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.440 align:middle line:84%
If you had to get
together at your home

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:20.790 align:middle line:84%
you had to watch what you said,
because the ears had walls,

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:21.564 align:middle line:90%
practically.

00:47:21.564 --> 00:47:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
getting to the point

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.290 align:middle line:84%
where the literal
walls will have ears.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just your
informant neighbors

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and the KGB spying on
you, or the Gestapo.

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Where it will become embedded
into our environment.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And so, if we get
to the point where

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.710 align:middle line:84%
there's rampant
corruption, excuse me,

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.007 align:middle line:84%
like in the banking industry
maybe, or in government.

00:47:41.007 --> 00:47:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh really?

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: So yeah, like,
that might happen some day.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we get to that point and
you want to be a whistleblower,

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.549 align:middle line:84%
or you want to speak out
against these technologies,

00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:52.590 align:middle line:84%
then they will have the
ability to shut you down,

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that your
chip doesn't work.

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Your account is not active.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:56.950 align:middle line:90%
You can't go on a plane.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.670 align:middle line:90%
You can't even start your car.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.176 align:middle line:84%
And so at that
point-- see right now,

00:48:01.176 --> 00:48:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I envision they're putting
a noose around society.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.200 align:middle line:90%
And its loose.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And we don't feel it.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:07.820 align:middle line:90%
I see it, everywhere I go.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I see the news and I'm
like, don't people see this?

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.030 align:middle line:84%
At some point that noose
is going to get yanked.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets
yanked this time,

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.360 align:middle line:84%
there's going to
be no going back,

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.980 align:middle line:90%
because it's going to be global.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.140 align:middle line:84%
See at least with the Soviet
Union, and with Hitler,

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.670 align:middle line:84%
we had an out, because it
wasn't the whole world.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But now it's becoming
the whole world.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we knew the
difference between right

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.190 align:middle line:90%
and wrong.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.481 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm not
sure we do anymore.

00:48:32.481 --> 00:48:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah,
it's getting scary.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And those human
values are getting

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:39.280 align:middle line:84%
lost, where people are not
even recognizing what they are,

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:39.970 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Where there's an ad that
I just saw that said,

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:45.470 align:middle line:84%
use your smartphone to watch
your kids and watch your baby.

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:48.431 align:middle line:84%
Won't it be great when the smart
phone can babysit your newborn?

00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:50.764 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, well, don't you
want to hold your newborn?

00:48:50.764 --> 00:48:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What'?

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:52.079 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.489 align:middle line:84%
Here's the smart phone, this
is mommy, put it right there.

00:48:55.489 --> 00:48:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Oh, my gosh.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: My ideal job
in the future will be,

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:04.190 align:middle line:84%
in every metropolitan city to
have a 20 foot screen of me

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:06.790 align:middle line:84%
beaming down on
people as they walk,

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:09.080 align:middle line:84%
everybody dressed in
little white outfits,

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and they'll see my
picture up there.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.424 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Like
that Apple ad, right?

00:49:12.424 --> 00:49:15.695 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I'll be dictating
things to people, 24/7.

00:49:15.695 --> 00:49:16.945 align:middle line:90%
That would be the perfect job.

00:49:16.945 --> 00:49:18.700 align:middle line:90%
I would like that.

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: I think that
even the people who are doing

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.670 align:middle line:84%
the dictating, many of them
think that they're doing a good

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:25.620 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:26.300 align:middle line:90%
They really do.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You think?

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: I think --
not all of them, perhaps,

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.870 align:middle line:90%
probably not most of them.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:30.900 align:middle line:90%
But there are people out here.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that the researchers,
for example, in those labs that

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.990 align:middle line:84%
are creating ways to
monitor elderly people

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.932 align:middle line:84%
for their own health, in
their own twisted thinking,

00:49:37.932 --> 00:49:39.140 align:middle line:90%
they think it's a good thing.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.223 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: And I've going to
say, don't you want your adult,

00:49:42.223 --> 00:49:44.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean you adult kids,
don't you want to call mom,

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.390 align:middle line:84%
instead of just looking at a
screen and seeing when she used

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:48.371 align:middle line:90%
the coffee maker?

00:49:48.371 --> 00:49:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've seen television
commercials, Katherine,

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.060 align:middle line:84%
where this little old lady
collapses of her floor,

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and she reaches for this
button and squeezes it.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that, you
go, this is great technology.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The ambulance will be here
to save mom, just like that.

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's a downside
from that, isn't there?

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:09.005 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Exactly.

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, they're going
for the elderly, that's

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:13.690 align:middle line:84%
who they were implanting with
the microchips, Alzheimer's

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:14.194 align:middle line:90%
patients.

00:50:14.194 --> 00:50:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Not only elderly people, but
elderly people who don't even

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:18.267 align:middle line:84%
understand what's
happening to them.

00:50:18.267 --> 00:50:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were rolling
up their sleeves

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.270 align:middle line:90%
and putting chips into them.

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they pick kids in a
poor community on the border

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Mexico, because they have access
to them, and because they can.

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, really, it's
going to be targeting our kids.

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.560 align:middle line:84%
It's targeting them through the
media, the music, the culture,

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.630 align:middle line:84%
the smart phones, the
cool, hip, amazingness.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you try to warn
the kids and you say,

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.850 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's not so
good to be staring

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:45.230 align:middle line:84%
into that device all day
and checking into Facebook,

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and using the GPS feature to
tell all your friends where

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.420 align:middle line:90%
you are.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.410 align:middle line:84%
They are trained by the media
to think that we're just

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:53.667 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of old fuddies
who don't get it.

00:50:53.667 --> 00:50:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying,
hey, wait a minute.

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:56.958 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these people
older than me actually

00:50:56.958 --> 00:50:59.930 align:middle line:84%
know something that's
a cultural value that I

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:01.590 align:middle line:84%
need to tune into
just a little bit.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:03.884 align:middle line:90%
And that brings me to the book.

00:51:03.884 --> 00:51:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Another one?

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.100 align:middle line:90%
You've written another one?

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: I have.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is this?

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: I have.

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this is
hot off the presses.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.720 align:middle line:84%
It's called "I Wont'
Take the Mark."

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.540 align:middle line:84%
it is a book for children,
specifically because of what

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.410 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:21.120 align:middle line:84%
That kids need to be warned
about the mark of the beast.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: This is a great idea.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
message at the end?

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I should read the
ending right now, huh?

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Well,
there's only a message.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you what is.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.280 align:middle line:84%
At the very end, so it
talks about Revelation.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.700 align:middle line:84%
How could John, exiled on an
island off the coast of Greece,

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.290 align:middle line:90%
practically living in a cave.

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:39.080 align:middle line:84%
How could he have seen a time
when you could buy or sell

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:39.710 align:middle line:90%
without a number?

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I know.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How could he have
known that unless the Bible was

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.150 align:middle line:90%
true?

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing in there,
Israel becoming a nation again,

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:47.495 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
that are happening

00:51:47.495 --> 00:51:49.370 align:middle line:84%
are pointing to the fact
that we are actually

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:51.995 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling prophecy, right
now, with our smart phones

00:51:51.995 --> 00:51:54.861 align:middle line:84%
and our bar codes and our RFID
tags and our credit cards,

00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:56.360 align:middle line:84%
it's happening right
in front of us.

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.984 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What a ride
it's going to be.

00:51:57.984 --> 00:52:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: So the real key,
and there's really only one

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.924 align:middle line:84%
actionable message
in Revelation.

00:52:03.924 --> 00:52:04.590 align:middle line:90%
You can read it.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:05.450 align:middle line:90%
It's complicated.

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:06.908 align:middle line:84%
You can spend a
lot of studying it.

00:52:06.908 --> 00:52:08.620 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
actionable message,

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and the actionable
message is, don't

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:12.495 align:middle line:90%
take the mark when it comes.

00:52:12.495 --> 00:52:13.770 align:middle line:90%
You need to that's it coming.

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Recognize it.

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Don't take it.

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:18.404 align:middle line:84%
And then call out to Christ
to save you from that time.

00:52:18.404 --> 00:52:19.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the only thing.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.870 align:middle line:84%
The rest of it is
all storytelling.

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:22.890 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's true.

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:24.030 align:middle line:90%
But it's all a story.

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:26.940 align:middle line:84%
But the thing you can
do is take that stand

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and not take that
mark when it comes.

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that this
generation of children

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to be to the
point where, you know,

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.070 align:middle line:84%
when they did the
Coachella Music Festival,

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:39.260 align:middle line:84%
there were tens of
thousands with RFID wrist

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.180 align:middle line:90%
bands on their right wrist.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of websites
talking about it.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, yeah, it was huge.

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:45.663 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Not one
said mark of the beast.

00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Not one mentioned it.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we've got, as
grandparents, as parents,

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:54.150 align:middle line:84%
as Sunday school teachers,
as people who love children,

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.420 align:middle line:84%
we've got to get this
information into their hands.

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
this all comes down to

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.135 align:middle line:90%
is the contract at the end.

00:53:00.135 --> 00:53:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You have the
little kids sign a contract?

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: It has a
little contract, right here.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And if you don't sign
it, we will take your soul,

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:08.210 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: No, George, gosh.

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:11.496 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:53:11.496 --> 00:53:13.330 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother, when I
was eight years old--

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:14.954 align:middle line:84%
I've told this story
on "Coast" before,

00:53:14.954 --> 00:53:16.760 align:middle line:84%
but I'll tell it again--
she's sat me down,

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.218 align:middle line:84%
after we had been
grocery shopping,

00:53:18.218 --> 00:53:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and she said, there
will come a time

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:22.203 align:middle line:84%
when people won't be able to
buy or sell without a mark,

00:53:22.203 --> 00:53:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to promise
me to never take it.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, all of
the products in the stores

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:middle line:90%
had stickers.

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.958 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: There
weren't any bar codes.

00:53:29.958 --> 00:53:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I had never even
seen a calculator.

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that we would
have high speed, ubiquitously

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:39.310 align:middle line:84%
networked, satellite linked,
smart phone payment systems

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.545 align:middle line:84%
in the stores was like
totally in the future.

00:53:41.545 --> 00:53:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You wouldn't
even think about that.

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: I
couldn't even imagine.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even imagine
how you could buy or sell

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:45.780 align:middle line:90%
with a number.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So I said, grandma, I
promise, I'll never do that.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:51.254 align:middle line:84%
And I also made myself a promise
that if I saw that coming true,

00:53:51.254 --> 00:53:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I would pick up my Bible and
know that the Bible was true,

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:56.330 align:middle line:84%
because it so outlandish
and so far-fetched.

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.715 align:middle line:84%
So I also said, I'll tell
my kids and great grand,

00:53:58.715 --> 00:54:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of years in
the future when this happens,

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:03.050 align:middle line:84%
my descendants will
know not to do it.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And now here we are
today, where young people

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.960 align:middle line:84%
are wearing tracking
devices around their necks,

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and putting on RFID tags, and
injecting them into themselves.

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So this contract
is, essentially,

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.049 align:middle line:84%
what my grandmother
asked me this sign.

00:54:14.049 --> 00:54:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, I didn't have to sign it.

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.381 align:middle line:90%
She just made me promise.

00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But this is an opportunity
for grandparents

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.120 align:middle line:90%
to share this information.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And you may not get a
lot of chances to do it.

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But it sticks in
their mind, once they sign that.

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: My grandmother
passed away a year after she

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.020 align:middle line:84%
shared this information with
me, and it changed my life.

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:29.285 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You never forgot it.

00:54:29.285 --> 00:54:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: I don't
think I would be here,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.300 align:middle line:84%
I know I wouldn't be here,
if it weren't for that.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Years ago, I was at
one of my favorite restaurants

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:35.700 align:middle line:90%
in St. Louis.

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And I have my little
tiny flip phone.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm making my little
calls before "Coast to Coast."

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:43.011 align:middle line:90%
And I'd flip it back.

00:54:43.011 --> 00:54:45.136 align:middle line:84%
And somebody came up to me
and said, you know what?

00:54:45.136 --> 00:54:47.450 align:middle line:84%
For an older guy,
you're kind of hot,

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:51.515 align:middle line:84%
but that phone makes you
look like a dinosaur.

00:54:51.515 --> 00:54:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Oh, wow.

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm saying,
it's just a phone.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, about a
week later, someone else

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.980 align:middle line:84%
came up and said the
exact same thing.

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So old George switched
to a smart phone.

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:06.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I use now.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And technologically, I
do my text messaging,

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and I do my sending
and stuff like that.

00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But that tells you how
people's mindset changes

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:17.700 align:middle line:84%
from one period,
where I never thought

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.419 align:middle line:84%
I would be using a
smart phone, to today.

00:55:20.419 --> 00:55:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Right.

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it could happen
to a lot of other people.

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: Right, today
it's the smart phone,

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.391 align:middle line:90%
what's it going to be tomorrow?

00:55:26.391 --> 00:55:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Hey, George, you only have
your RFID tag on a watch.

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:31.350 align:middle line:90%
I've got the implant.

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Put it right here.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah, exactly.

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It'll be easier.

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Yeah.

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:35.881 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You brought me a cup.

00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: I did.

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is this?

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:38.931 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: This
is from Start Page.

00:55:38.931 --> 00:55:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I love these
gifts, by the way.

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> ALBRECHT: So this is such
discouraging information,

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:47.460 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about RFID and
privacy innovation and how

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.584 align:middle line:84%
Google monitors all your
searches and they read all

00:55:49.584 --> 00:55:51.580 align:middle line:84%
your email, people
get freaked out.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
that I love to be able to do

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.030 align:middle line:84%
is to say, there
are steps you can

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:57.660 align:middle line:90%
take to protect your privacy.

00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I worked with
the folks at Ixquick,

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:00.850 align:middle line:90%
which you may recall.

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Ixquick, the European
search engine,

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.670 align:middle line:84%
to create Start Page,
which is a private--

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which has got
a great name, by the way.

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Thank you.

00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:07.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I actually helped
come up with that.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Startpage.com?

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:10.194 align:middle line:90%
>> ALBRECHT: Startpage.com.

00:56:10.194 --> 00:56:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is the place where
you can access and do searches

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.020 align:middle line:84%
without-- it's actually
real Google searches,

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.044 align:middle line:84%
you can access Google searches
without Google seeing you.

00:56:18.044 --> 00:56:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing
about it is, we

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.560 align:middle line:84%
delete all records
of your visit.

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know your IP
address, your location.

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:27.197 align:middle line:84%
And if we were subpoenaed
or, God forbid, hacked,

00:56:27.197 --> 00:56:28.780 align:middle line:84%
which has never
happen, but if it did,

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.450 align:middle line:90%
there would be nothing to get.

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You don't have it.

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.270 align:middle line:84%
