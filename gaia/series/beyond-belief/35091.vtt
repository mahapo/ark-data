>> I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.471 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.306 align:middle line:90%
>> People are basically going

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.374 align:middle line:84%
to [inaudible] what
really happened.

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.743 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.778 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information,

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.446 align:middle line:84%
we weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:21.922 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:25.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Since I was a little boy
fascinated with the Wizard of Oz

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:29.763 align:middle line:84%
and witches, the good
witch and the bad witch,

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:33.133 align:middle line:84%
tonight on Beyond Belief we're
going to talk to Leanne Marrama

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:38.538 align:middle line:84%
about witchcraft because you
are a real practicing witch

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.372 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, I am.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.241 align:middle line:90%
>> How did that happen?

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.909 align:middle line:90%
You're not born a witch are you?

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Some people
feel that they are born a witch.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.548 align:middle line:84%
I feel I worked my way
into the way of witchcraft.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.917 align:middle line:84%
I always had some
different things about me

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:55.255 align:middle line:84%
that made me a little more
unusual than the local kids.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:59.159 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm the girl that brought
the Ouija board into junior high

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.827 align:middle line:90%
so everyone could use it.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.697 align:middle line:84%
I was the one who ran around
in graveyards and a lot

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:08.168 align:middle line:84%
of us do that, but I took it to
the next level because I could.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:11.671 align:middle line:84%
Not after a period of kind of
walking away from the craft.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:15.742 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of my years
becoming a secretary really

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.344 align:middle line:90%
dumbing down my magic.

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:19.312 align:middle line:90%
I kind of unpowered myself.

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:20.146 align:middle line:90%
>> And you missed it didn't you?

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I missed it.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.217 align:middle line:84%
I missed it, I raised my
kids and I became a great mom

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
but something else kept
on calling out to me;

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.989 align:middle line:84%
other faiths weren't
working for me.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:30.423 align:middle line:84%
I, you know, that's
what this is all

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.892 align:middle line:84%
about this whole
witchcraft thing it's

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:35.661 align:middle line:84%
about what you believe in and
how much you can take from it

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.566 align:middle line:84%
and that's what life is about
and I didn't love my faith.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:44.638 align:middle line:84%
So, I went back to a more
earthy path, more magical path

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:48.675 align:middle line:84%
and I claimed myself as a witch
and I learned and I studied

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.945 align:middle line:84%
and that's how I became a
witch through hard work.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Hollywood has
destroyed the reputation

00:01:55.682 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
of a witch there's no question
because when I was a kid leading

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.056 align:middle line:84%
into before I started doing
Coast to Coast, Leanne,

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:07.994 align:middle line:84%
I thought witch people
were evil, satanic,

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.096 align:middle line:84%
running around with
high hats and,

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.665 align:middle line:90%
you know, brooms and doing --

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:12.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
-- that we do --

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.601 align:middle line:84%
>> -- things and turning
kids into gingerbread.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:15.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: [Laughter]

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.469 align:middle line:90%
>> How wrong I was.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, yes.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.407 align:middle line:84%
You were other than the high
hats and the kids, the kids

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:22.309 align:middle line:84%
and gingerbread sometimes
that happens.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:23.576 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not my fault;
Hollywood did that.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: But on
a serious note we're just

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.248 align:middle line:84%
like any other religion
except we dress different

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:29.616 align:middle line:90%
or we talk different.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:32.552 align:middle line:84%
It's the unknown I
find is what fears.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:35.455 align:middle line:84%
So I want everyone to know
witches, we don't even believe

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.557 align:middle line:90%
in the existence of the devil.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:41.094 align:middle line:84%
At least most witches I know
we don't worship the devil and,

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:45.265 align:middle line:84%
in fact, we don't even worship,
we honor, we honor our gods

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.601 align:middle line:84%
and in creation and we're very
connected with this earth.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you Wiccan?

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I would say
for me, no, I am not Wiccan.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:55.141 align:middle line:84%
I am a witch and I practice
a very Italian path.

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:59.746 align:middle line:84%
My culture is Italian
so the word for witch

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.281 align:middle line:90%
in Italian is strega [phonetic].

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Strega.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:02.849 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Strega.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> What's an Italian witch?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: A strega.

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.051 align:middle line:90%
>> She makes pasta.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.186 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: She
doesn't just make pasta.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.191 align:middle line:84%
An Italian witch we're very
homey, we're very different,

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.493 align:middle line:90%
but we believe in justice.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:16.261 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes some people would
think an Italian witch may would

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:18.665 align:middle line:84%
be a little darker
in the craft, but no,

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.401 align:middle line:84%
we believe in justice
not so much curses.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:90%
We believe in family.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.939 align:middle line:90%
We believe in truth.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Halloween sets the stage
for my favorite season

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:31.845 align:middle line:84%
because it's Halloween,
Thanksgiving, Christmas,

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:34.614 align:middle line:84%
New Years, it doesn't
get any better.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:38.685 align:middle line:84%
For witches, you know,
as many of us, you know,

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:40.687 align:middle line:84%
run around in our
little costumes

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:44.591 align:middle line:84%
and go trick-or-treating and
carving pumpkins and stuff,

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:84%
what do witches do
around Halloween?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Well,
witches, we celebrate Halloween

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:52.599 align:middle line:84%
but we don't actually
call it Halloween.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you call it?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: We call
it Salween [phonetic].

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Salween?

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:56.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Salween.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:58.805 align:middle line:90%
It's a Celtic word.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. What it's mean?

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Every
culture does have a Halloween

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.879 align:middle line:84%
or a Salween and it's a time
in which we honor our dead.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.882 align:middle line:84%
Salween is the time when
the dead walk among us.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:12.252 align:middle line:84%
It's also considered
the last harvest.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.053 align:middle line:90%
It is our New Year.

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:14.688 align:middle line:90%
We celebrate our hard work.

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:15.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you do.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:15.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: We celebrate,
we celebrate with love,

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:22.962 align:middle line:84%
we celebrate with passion,
and we also honor our dead.

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.964 align:middle line:90%
Now Halloween being a time

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:30.336 align:middle line:84%
that when the witches walk
among us is a time when we, oh,

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:33.206 align:middle line:84%
we just welcome in all of those
who have gone, that's the time

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:36.443 align:middle line:84%
when I really, really
remember my grandparents

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.145 align:middle line:84%
and in Salem we hold
festivals --

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> -- so it's pretty emotional?

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Oh, it is emotional.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
We cry and we laugh
and we rejoice.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.719 align:middle line:90%
It's the closing of the year.

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.322 align:middle line:84%
It's a mark of what
did you do this year?

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.256 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:51.558 align:middle line:84%
What do you have
for your harvest?

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.359 align:middle line:84%
It's the time for
you to really examine

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:55.195 align:middle line:90%
and look did you work hard?

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:56.629 align:middle line:90%
Did you do it yourself?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.234 align:middle line:84%
Be proud, celebrate, rejoice and
then welcome in your ancestors,

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:84%
your great grandparents,
your parents who have gone,

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.906 align:middle line:84%
the people you love;
that's a time when you bring

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:09.476 align:middle line:84%
out their pictures and
you celebrate and you eat

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:14.614 align:middle line:84%
with them much like the day of
the dead, which is November 1st.

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:17.083 align:middle line:84%
>> All Saints Day in
the Catholic Church.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
All Saints Day.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you born a witch
or did you develop this?

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:23.089 align:middle line:84%
I mean were your
parents witches?

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I believe I
was born with magical powers.

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.193 align:middle line:90%
I believe I had gifts.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:30.829 align:middle line:84%
Special gifts, but I believe
my gifts are not exceptional

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:32.265 align:middle line:90%
to anyone else.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:36.236 align:middle line:84%
I believe we all possess a
little psychic ability but, no,

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.103 align:middle line:90%
my faith wasn't the craft.

00:05:38.103 --> 00:05:40.573 align:middle line:90%
My parents were Catholics.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:43.343 align:middle line:90%
I was raised as a Catholic

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.346 align:middle line:84%
but there was always something
different that I would do.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I, you know, there's a saying
that all faith is magical.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.756 align:middle line:84%
You can find magic in every
faith, but let me explain.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.958 align:middle line:84%
My parents, my parents
are very grounded people.

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.896 align:middle line:84%
My mother was a stockbroker
and my father was a carpenter,

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:06.332 align:middle line:84%
you know, just regular people
and it was a shock to them

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:07.901 align:middle line:84%
that I came out of
the broom closet --

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:09.302 align:middle line:90%
>> -- literally.

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: And became a
witch literally, busted it open.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever jump
on the broom?

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: There
were moments where I have.

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:15.141 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you have a flying broom?

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:17.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I
don't have a flying broom.

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.246 align:middle line:84%
What the broom is for
actually, the broom is

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:22.015 align:middle line:84%
for cleaning just
like everything else.

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:23.283 align:middle line:90%
>> And cleansing.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:25.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Cleansing,
opening up sacred space.

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
African cultures use it
to open up a wedding.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.557 align:middle line:84%
You jump over that broom
because it's representative

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.926 align:middle line:90%
of day-to-day tasks.

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:34.394 align:middle line:84%
The broom is also a
sign of protection.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.895 align:middle line:84%
>> The Jewish people
break plates.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:36.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, they do.

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:37.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Mazel tov.

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:39.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Mazel tov, why not?

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:40.366 align:middle line:84%
>> I went to a Jewish
wedding once.

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.634 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
what was going on.

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:43.036 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was breaking a plate.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Doesn't it in
some ways remind you of magic?

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:45.805 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:46.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: It does.

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.975 align:middle line:84%
I detect a New England
accent from you.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:49.809 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Absolutely.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.177 align:middle line:90%
It's very thick and very strong.

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm from Boston, Mass, and I
work in Salem, Massachusetts.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.014 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: The
witch city of the world.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.053 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you have been burned at
the stake in that time period?

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:02.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Well, they
didn't burn witches in Salem

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.491 align:middle line:84%
at that time period but they
sure would have just, yeah,

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:07.193 align:middle line:84%
they would have found
a way to get rid of me.

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:08.995 align:middle line:84%
I would have sat in
that dunking chair.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:10.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally unjustifiable.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Completely
unjustifiable because witches,

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:16.336 align:middle line:84%
a real witch will not
hurt anyone and just

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:20.039 align:middle line:84%
like every faith you've got
good people and bad people.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.309 align:middle line:84%
I know some bad witches
because they're bad people.

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:24.377 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:25.745 align:middle line:84%
There's always a bad
apple in the basket.

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:28.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Always and
bad people are just people.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:33.419 align:middle line:84%
It's not about their faith just
like all kinds of religions.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
You know they let the
negative few rule the masses.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.626 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't agree with that.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.494 align:middle line:90%
I think that inside

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:84%
of everyone's belief there
should be respect and honor

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.732 align:middle line:90%
and the first thing is love.

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:46.899 align:middle line:90%
That's what this religion has --

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.734 align:middle line:84%
>> -- I'm looking
at you, Leanne,

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:49.769 align:middle line:90%
and I don't see any warts.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you cackle?

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I do cackle.

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:54.707 align:middle line:90%
>> You can do a witch cackle?

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:55.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah.

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:56.943 align:middle line:90%
>> Would you do one for me?

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: [Cackling]

00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> See. That sounds
kind of evil to me.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: It is, but
it sounds evil but it isn't.

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you doing it for fun?

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:05.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Cackling is for fun.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Why does anyone cackle?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.222 align:middle line:84%
Don't just about
everybody cackle?

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I don't.

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:11.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: You do
when you laugh hard enough.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.125 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:12.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Come on.

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you need a good laugh.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.061 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never been on a date
with a girl who cackled.

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama:

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:16.929 align:middle line:84%
You're missing something
really awesome.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In the middle
of a restaurant,

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.964 align:middle line:90%
can you imagine that laugh.

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:21.034 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:21.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: [Cackling].

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:22.902 align:middle line:90%
>> You'd be the hit of the --

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:23.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
-- and I snort too.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:24.771 align:middle line:90%
>> You do?

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:25.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Which has
nothing to do with witchcraft.

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:27.106 align:middle line:84%
It just means I'm
having a good time.

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay, so witch, I
mean do you do spells?

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:30.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, I do.

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:31.277 align:middle line:90%
>> And curses?

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:32.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
I do do spells.

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:33.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you ever done a curse?

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:34.614 align:middle line:90%
Be honest.

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:35.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
I have done a curse.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.582 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:38.584 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you
something for curses.

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:39.986 align:middle line:90%
>> And why did you do a curse?

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:41.321 align:middle line:90%
Tell me that story.

00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I did a
curse because I was justified.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.425 align:middle line:90%
I was justified in that curse.

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:48.928 align:middle line:84%
When you do a curse or a hex,
you've got to be justified.

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:52.131 align:middle line:84%
You can't, you can't harm
someone just because they,

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:53.933 align:middle line:84%
you know, cut you
off in traffic.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:55.234 align:middle line:90%
>> They tried to hurt you.

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: This is
somebody who hurt my family,

00:08:56.569 --> 00:09:00.073 align:middle line:84%
hurt my children, God help
you if you harm my children.

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:01.341 align:middle line:90%
Any mother out there would --

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:03.409 align:middle line:84%
>> -- I come from that school
too, but there are a lot

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:06.612 align:middle line:84%
of people who say
forgive and forget.

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:07.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I understand.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.982 align:middle line:90%
I do after I let karma.

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:12.919 align:middle line:84%
On some level, there's
question of karma,

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.754 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes karma
needs a little help.

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:16.622 align:middle line:84%
>> So what kind of a
curse did you conjure up

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:18.758 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
to this person?

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:22.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I, and
this is a lesson for everyone,

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:24.597 align:middle line:90%
I cursed somebody to go away.

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:25.398 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: To go --

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.467 align:middle line:84%
>> -- and what's the
definition of go away?

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:29.936 align:middle line:84%
Go away to me means
drop over dead.

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.238 align:middle line:84%
I would never harm
anyone to die.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:35.541 align:middle line:84%
Bad people need to live because
that's the worst suffering.

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:36.743 align:middle line:84%
>> So just move,
get out of the way.

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:37.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Just go out of my way.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Go, just go, get
lost, and they did

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.081 align:middle line:84%
and then something
awful happened.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.549 align:middle line:90%
I missed them.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.051 align:middle line:90%
>> You did miss them?

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:45.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I did so.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:46.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Anyway what's this?

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:47.754 align:middle line:90%
Hold that up for the camera.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: This is
a voodoo doll, a poppet.

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:53.459 align:middle line:84%
It is a way, it's a form of
sympathetic magic in which

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.495 align:middle line:90%
like is drawn to like.

00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:57.163 align:middle line:90%
An image of a person.

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me see this.

00:09:58.297 --> 00:09:59.799 align:middle line:90%
Can I hold it?

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:02.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Yeah, he looks loving.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:02.869 align:middle line:90%
>> There he is.

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do with this?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Okay.

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:09.308 align:middle line:84%
I infuse it with the energy of
a person who has really, really,

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:11.144 align:middle line:90%
for me to bring out the dolly,

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:84%
you've had to really
piss me off.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.983 align:middle line:90%
Mostly what I do I can show you,

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:19.919 align:middle line:84%
what I'll do is I'll
bind that person.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I'll say I bind you from
harming me but I also bind you

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.292 align:middle line:90%
from harming yourself.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.227 align:middle line:84%
What I do is I tie
this person up.

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Ouch!

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I stuff
them and then I send them away.

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:35.101 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe they'll find a better
day without harming others,

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.403 align:middle line:84%
but what I do is I take
that negative energy

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.205 align:middle line:84%
and I transform it
and I get rid of it.

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.674 align:middle line:84%
I get rid of those
people that harm you,

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:42.809 align:middle line:90%
get rid of them right now.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you need a piece
of the guy's hair?

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:46.212 align:middle line:90%
Let's see this little thing.

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.014 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Sometimes
you can put a picture or a piece

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:49.916 align:middle line:84%
of someone's hair and why
does it have to be a guy?

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:51.017 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes women need it too.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:52.051 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:53.352 align:middle line:84%
It physically has
to have the person?

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:53.986 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: It can.

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.321 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't always.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:11:01.861 align:middle line:84%
You can start your spell by
naming it somebody you don't

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:05.031 align:middle line:84%
like and you put that,
you make it your Gollum,

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.899 align:middle line:90%
you make it your poppet.

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:10.203 align:middle line:84%
You say it and you create
it into that person.

00:11:10.203 --> 00:11:11.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have to
put the picture

00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:13.039 align:middle line:90%
of the person on the side?

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: The
more information you have

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:18.277 align:middle line:84%
about a person to put in a
poppet is the better you have.

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:19.378 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:20.446 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happened to
the old karma what goes

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:21.814 align:middle line:90%
around comes around?

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:25.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Karma is a
very Middle Eastern concept.

00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:29.021 align:middle line:84%
I do, I do believe in it on
some level, but I also believe

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:32.425 align:middle line:84%
that with that being said about
karma that doesn't mean you have

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:90%
to take anyone's crap.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.896 align:middle line:84%
>> So it sounds like to me
with this particular object -

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:37.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
It's a serious spell.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.966 align:middle line:90%
>> This is darn serious -

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
-- it's serious.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.905 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's no nonsense and
honestly it's not friendly.

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:48.608 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of vindictive
isn't it?

00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:49.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: It is.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:53.412 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely is, but
how would you react

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:56.182 align:middle line:90%
if somebody let's say -

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.583 align:middle line:90%
>> -- harmed my family?

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:58.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Harmed your family?

00:11:58.484 --> 00:11:59.852 align:middle line:90%
>> I would take them out.

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.354 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, and
this is how you take them out

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:03.356 align:middle line:84%
and what I do is
I push them away

00:12:03.356 --> 00:12:05.291 align:middle line:84%
and I want them to
learn a lesson.

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:09.195 align:middle line:84%
So what I say is I
say, I don't want

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:10.496 align:middle line:90%
to use anyone's names right now.

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> No. So maybe if you
want to say Producer Tom.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.203 align:middle line:90%
No, no. Let's not do it to Tom.

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:18.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Tom.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:19.972 align:middle line:84%
I would say spirit
of the poppet.

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Call him Jay.

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Some guy
Jay is going to have a bad day.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.681 align:middle line:84%
Spirit of Jay whoever you
are you have caused harm,

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:30.516 align:middle line:90%
you have harmed my business,

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:34.754 align:middle line:84%
you've hurt my house
the way I feed myself.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.523 align:middle line:84%
Now I make you unable
to touch it.

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:40.793 align:middle line:90%
So I tape the hand together.

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:43.129 align:middle line:90%
What is mine.

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:45.131 align:middle line:84%
I choose that you do
not walk in my space.

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Is Jay grimacing right now?

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:48.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Well,
he can't walk in my space.

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.437 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know anyone Jay so
I'm not really harming anyone.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:55.575 align:middle line:84%
Then you pin them all up
and you just get rid of it.

00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:57.743 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't hang on to
anything like this.

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:59.045 align:middle line:84%
I would either send
it down the river.

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:00.212 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want to
get rid of him.

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.581 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go that far.

00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:03.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: You don't
get rid of it like kill them.

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.785 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of it
like you say go.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.854 align:middle line:84%
The best curse ever I'll
say is to tell someone

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:11.791 align:middle line:90%
to go be great somewhere else.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:84%
That's just I don't want
them whatever their great is

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.761 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you do nice
things to people?

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Damn straight I do.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:20.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Like what?

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Like love and healing

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I believe
this whole world is about.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me hold this
little poppet up.

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:27.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Now that's
to draw in love and healing,

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:31.143 align:middle line:84%
you know, colors
are very magical.

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:34.246 align:middle line:84%
Pink is generally used
for love, friendship.

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.349 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the opposite
of what that one is?

00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:37.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: That is.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.851 align:middle line:84%
That's because you want
somebody close to you.

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:42.421 align:middle line:84%
This makes someone go away,
which I think is a curse.

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.823 align:middle line:90%
>> This makes them calm.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:44.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: That makes
them calm, which is a blessing.

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:46.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's take a phone call here.

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:47.727 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one of our
phone calls from one

00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:51.197 align:middle line:90%
of our very avid viewers.

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:53.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne, I would like
to know the difference

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:55.868 align:middle line:90%
between spells and incantations.

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:56.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Okay, great.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:57.637 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:13:57.637 --> 00:13:58.471 align:middle line:84%
We were just talking
about spells.

00:13:58.471 --> 00:13:59.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: That's great.

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:03.242 align:middle line:90%
A spell is like a prayer, okay,

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:09.015 align:middle line:84%
and a spell will facilitate
what you want bring it

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:12.018 align:middle line:90%
out what you need, all right?

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of a prayer,
it reminds me of a blessing

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.456 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes not so much
a blessing depending

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:18.691 align:middle line:90%
on what it is.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:25.097 align:middle line:84%
An incantation tends to
have the same kind of energy

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:27.933 align:middle line:84%
where it brings you
something you want.

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:30.335 align:middle line:84%
You ask the universe for
something and you get it,

00:14:30.335 --> 00:14:35.675 align:middle line:84%
but incantations you generally
use with chants and mantras

00:14:35.675 --> 00:14:38.177 align:middle line:84%
where you would repeat
to bring about.

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:39.111 align:middle line:90%
>> The same goal?

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:40.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
An incantation

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:43.616 align:middle line:84%
to bring something in, but
you're bringing something in

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:47.953 align:middle line:84%
and in this case at times
people use incantations a lot

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:52.224 align:middle line:84%
to conjure spirits,
to draw in the energy

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:57.129 align:middle line:90%
of a powerful deity or a person.

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:59.398 align:middle line:84%
And that is what that is
for, conjuring spirits.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.467 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a ball
every year, don't you?

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:04.036 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Salem
Witch's Ball.

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.137 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
I am thrilled.

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:06.272 align:middle line:90%
>> What do they do?

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:07.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: We
have not just a ball.

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:11.711 align:middle line:84%
We have a series of events and
I am fortunate to be a part

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:13.279 align:middle line:90%
of what's known as the festival

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.948 align:middle line:84%
of the dead, which
is phenomenal.

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:17.349 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that?

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Oh, it is a
month-long series of psychics,

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.458 align:middle line:84%
of events, parties
and celebrations

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.059 align:middle line:84%
because remember
this is our New Year.

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:27.893 align:middle line:90%
>> This is it.

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: This is it.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.162 align:middle line:84%
This is the big one
and everybody comes

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:31.464 align:middle line:90%
from all across the world.

00:15:31.464 --> 00:15:35.801 align:middle line:84%
We have people from Japan
and China and all of Europe

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:90%
that come to this event.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:41.006 align:middle line:90%
Well, the witch's ball -

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:42.007 align:middle line:90%
>> -- you dress up?

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:43.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Oh, do I dress up.

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:44.643 align:middle line:90%
I have fun.

00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:47.012 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, everyone dresses
up and this year's theme

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:49.482 align:middle line:90%
of the witch's ball is, well,

00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:51.417 align:middle line:84%
it depends on the theme
of the witch's ball.

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:55.287 align:middle line:84%
The theme of the witch's ball
this year is about familiars

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:58.891 align:middle line:84%
and a familiar is your
loving pet that provides you

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:00.192 align:middle line:90%
with magic and energy.

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.227 align:middle line:90%
>> You bring the pet with you?

00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:02.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:03.529 align:middle line:84%
We're going to dress up
like different animals

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:05.231 align:middle line:90%
and not furry or creepy like.

00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:06.699 align:middle line:90%
I'm serious.

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.167 align:middle line:90%
This year at the ball -

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:09.235 align:middle line:90%
>> -- like a lion?

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:10.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah.

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.671 align:middle line:84%
Some people will be lions,
some people will be ravens,

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:13.606 align:middle line:90%
some people will be cats.

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:14.907 align:middle line:90%
>> And everybody does this?

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:16.308 align:middle line:90%
Are you masked?

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:19.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Your choice,
but yes, I am masked every year.

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.881 align:middle line:90%
I am masked until midnight.

00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:24.183 align:middle line:90%
>> A guy witch is he a warlock?

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:25.818 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they call them?

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:28.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Being
called, well, warlock, yes.

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:31.657 align:middle line:84%
A guy witch can be called
a warlock and many people,

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know they seem
to be very confused.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.562 align:middle line:84%
Men can be called whatever
they want in the craft.

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:38.764 align:middle line:84%
Some choose to be called
witches and some choose

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.299 align:middle line:90%
to be called warlocks.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.068 align:middle line:84%
Personally I just think
warlock is way sexier.

00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:44.303 align:middle line:90%
>> I do too.

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:46.972 align:middle line:84%
If I were a guy witch, I
would want to be a warlock.

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah,
you would be a warlock.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a warlock in
Bewitched, wasn't there?

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, there
was and sometimes people feel

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:84%
that the word warlock
they don't understand,

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.182 align:middle line:90%
they have to learn the history.

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:59.451 align:middle line:84%
The word warlock means
traitor and a lot

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:04.489 align:middle line:84%
of the witches they seem to,
they are afraid of the word

00:17:04.489 --> 00:17:06.691 align:middle line:84%
and I don't blame them
because for years,

00:17:06.691 --> 00:17:10.262 align:middle line:84%
for years we've all heard this
history of warlock means traitor

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:12.598 align:middle line:84%
but no one ever did a
little extra research.

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:15.868 align:middle line:84%
Warlock actually means
traitor to the church.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.571 align:middle line:84%
So if you would like to know
what we are, we are in a way -

00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:19.939 align:middle line:90%
>> -- traitors to the church.

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:21.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: -- traitors
and we did leave the church.

00:17:21.574 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of Christians probably
would not be happy with you -

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.878 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
-- no, they are not.

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.046 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't understand

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.914 align:middle line:84%
that you are God-loving
people aren't you?

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:30.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: We
are God-loving people.

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:34.153 align:middle line:84%
We worship just our
way, our style,

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:36.055 align:middle line:90%
we don't mean to harm anyone.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:39.391 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do is to
celebrate our faith and we want

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.894 align:middle line:84%
to be respected just
like everybody else.

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.663 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me about the
good old witch's coven.

00:17:44.663 --> 00:17:46.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I
have a wonderful coven.

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:50.035 align:middle line:84%
I love every single one of
them and I can honestly say

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:90%
with pride I run my coven with,

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.038 align:middle line:84%
Christian Day is a
very well-known -

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:53.806 align:middle line:90%
>> -- I know Christian.

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.107 align:middle line:90%
He has been on my show.

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:56.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: He's a
great guy, he's a good guy,

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:58.344 align:middle line:90%
and it's with a family.

00:17:58.344 --> 00:17:59.645 align:middle line:90%
We are truly like a family.

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:02.314 align:middle line:84%
We eat dinner together,
we travel together

00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:04.149 align:middle line:90%
and we worship together.

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:06.585 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot like
going to church.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.153 align:middle line:90%
>> He loves what he does.

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:09.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: He
absolutely loves what he does

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:13.125 align:middle line:84%
and he does it well and
his events are spectacular

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.527 align:middle line:84%
and he's a great
person to run the coven

00:18:15.527 --> 00:18:17.229 align:middle line:90%
with because he's magical.

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:19.131 align:middle line:84%
He has a great connection
with the dead.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:23.002 align:middle line:84%
>> Is he good for the
witchcraft industry?

00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:24.436 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Christian Day is not just good

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:25.571 align:middle line:90%
for the witchcraft industry,

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:27.373 align:middle line:84%
I think he is the
witchcraft industry.

00:18:27.373 --> 00:18:28.374 align:middle line:90%
He's phenomenal.

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:30.709 align:middle line:84%
He is, he's very
good you know why?

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:32.578 align:middle line:90%
Because he pushes envelopes.

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:35.381 align:middle line:84%
I like change, I
like difference.

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:40.019 align:middle line:84%
If witchcraft as a religion
of faith and we have

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:43.122 align:middle line:84%
so many different, we
have different traditions

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.591 align:middle line:84%
and different thoughts, if
we do not grow and change,

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:47.026 align:middle line:90%
we'll be doomed to die.

00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:49.995 align:middle line:84%
So, what we have to do is
we do we have to be updated,

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:52.131 align:middle line:84%
we have to constantly
be on our toes

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:56.201 align:middle line:84%
and I think Christian
challenges on some level society

00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:57.169 align:middle line:90%
because he is different.

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he is a great witch.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.104 align:middle line:90%
What are these candles for?

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:00.072 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: All right.

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:02.274 align:middle line:84%
We have two amazing
candles here.

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:07.246 align:middle line:84%
This is the conjured
spirits candle and for me I

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:10.149 align:middle line:84%
like this definitely
on Halloween, Salween,

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:14.253 align:middle line:84%
on Salween this candle will
be lit on my personal alter.

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:16.221 align:middle line:90%
It is for necromancy.

00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:20.659 align:middle line:84%
Necromancy is like honestly is
the art of spirit conjuration,

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.761 align:middle line:90%
there's that word to conjure.

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:28.901 align:middle line:84%
It's to draw in other spirits
for help or assistance, okay,

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:31.437 align:middle line:90%
so who would I conjure?

00:19:31.437 --> 00:19:33.305 align:middle line:84%
Would I conjure, who
would you conjure?

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:35.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it have to
be somebody dead?

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:38.544 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: It has to be
because that's what this is for.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:40.045 align:middle line:84%
>> I would want my
dad to show up.

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Okay, and
he would help you, right?

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:44.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Because a
lot of people believe in going

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:47.186 align:middle line:84%
to a higher power and I do
every once in a while I go

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.822 align:middle line:84%
to the source, you know,
whatever you want to call God,

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:54.593 align:middle line:84%
you know, God, Goddess, the
universe, the force of love,

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:57.329 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes I think the
little things when it's dealing

00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:02.868 align:middle line:84%
with little things I'll call my
grandparents or in this case I'd

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.371 align:middle line:84%
like to call my dear friend,
Shawn Poorer [phonetic]

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:07.339 align:middle line:84%
into the room and I'll
do the spell right here.

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:08.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:10.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: All right,
okay, on winds of breath

00:20:10.743 --> 00:20:14.079 align:middle line:84%
to realms of death
by blood and bone

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:20.119 align:middle line:84%
and to cold bronze blade aid
my cause on oh darken shade.

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:23.222 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to summon
my friend, Shawn,

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.690 align:middle line:84%
here into this candle
and to this room

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:25.891 align:middle line:90%
to help me with this interview.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:26.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:28.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
And to bless us all.

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:35.334 align:middle line:84%
He was a fabulous which so
I summon you into this room

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:84%
to help me with my magic and
to bless everyone out there.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.609 align:middle line:90%
God bless you all.

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.244 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you know he shows up?

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I feel him.

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:52.017 align:middle line:84%
So I just, you know, when
you've lost somebody in life -

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.118 align:middle line:90%
>> -- you're getting emotional.

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:54.053 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah, I am.

00:20:54.053 --> 00:20:55.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:56.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: He was
just a very, very special man

00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:59.058 align:middle line:84%
and he would have loved this and
he would have loved your show.

00:20:59.058 --> 00:21:00.926 align:middle line:84%
He would have loved
you, you know,

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:05.197 align:middle line:84%
he believed in the difference
of magic and that's one thing

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:08.734 align:middle line:84%
about witchcraft and being in
the coven to go back to that.

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:11.203 align:middle line:84%
They are your family, these
people are my brothers.

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:14.873 align:middle line:84%
I'm fortunate to have
amazing friends, you know,

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:16.241 align:middle line:90%
that are filled with magic.

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:18.777 align:middle line:84%
I have Laurie Stestapholous
[phonetic],

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:23.882 align:middle line:84%
I have the people just
really phenomenal friends;

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:27.553 align:middle line:84%
they are my brothers and my
sisters and I know most witches

00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:30.055 align:middle line:84%
out there you all feel
that way about your coven.

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if you blow
it out, what happens?

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.858 align:middle line:90%
Shawn goes away?

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:33.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: You're
not going to blow it out,

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:90%
and no, it does not go away.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.261 align:middle line:90%
People do not go away.

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:39.031 align:middle line:84%
If you do not go away in
death, you do not go away

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.566 align:middle line:90%
with the snuffing of a candle.

00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:41.967 align:middle line:90%
>> How long do you let it burn?

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Well, I light
it a little bit every day you

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:44.336 align:middle line:90%
know what I mean?

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:45.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Just a little bit.

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:46.872 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: That would
be a 7-day candle for me

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:49.374 align:middle line:84%
and I would take a little
bit every day and burn it

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:52.711 align:middle line:90%
and we do not blow out candles.

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:53.612 align:middle line:90%
We pinch it out.

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:54.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Ouch.

00:21:54.546 --> 00:21:55.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
It doesn't hurt.

00:21:55.214 --> 00:21:56.148 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't hurt?

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:57.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
It doesn't hurt.

00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And there it goes
and there goes Shawn.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:58.817 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yeah.

00:21:58.817 --> 00:21:59.985 align:middle line:90%
>> What's this one for?

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:02.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: This
is for spirit guides

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:07.526 align:middle line:84%
and there are times when
you really want to connect

00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:12.064 align:middle line:84%
with the softer side of
friends and family that are gone

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:14.633 align:middle line:90%
and we all have spirit guides.

00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:20.139 align:middle line:84%
We all have this energy
guardian angel thing,

00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:22.975 align:middle line:84%
this one thing that's
dedicated to us

00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes we need help.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Hold that up a
little higher, please.

00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:28.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Sometimes we
need help and sometimes you need

00:22:28.914 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:90%
to call in your spirit guide.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.485 align:middle line:84%
>> And we all have
spirit guides don't we?

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:34.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes.

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we absolutely do.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.689 align:middle line:84%
They are our guardian
angels, they are our light,

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:39.725 align:middle line:84%
and I want everyone
here and everyone

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:42.194 align:middle line:90%
out there to be protected.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:43.428 align:middle line:90%
If you're watching this,

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:47.099 align:middle line:84%
may your spirit guide
give you great guidance.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:50.235 align:middle line:84%
May they offer you strength
and sometimes you need to just

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:52.771 align:middle line:84%
like for your spirit
guides to say thank you,

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:56.608 align:middle line:84%
thank you for the safe
trip out to Colorado.

00:22:56.608 --> 00:23:01.647 align:middle line:84%
The strongest bonds death cannot
tear for I know you love me

00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:04.116 align:middle line:90%
and will always be there.

00:23:04.116 --> 00:23:06.618 align:middle line:84%
Please share your guidance
and hear my prayer.

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:13.859 align:middle line:84%
>> And up comes the
spirit guide.

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:16.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: And
you work the candle.

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:18.931 align:middle line:84%
You look at the flame,
look at that deep part

00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:22.467 align:middle line:84%
of the flame and
you talk to them.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:25.137 align:middle line:90%
You say spirit guide, guide me.

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:27.372 align:middle line:90%
May my return trip be safe.

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:29.675 align:middle line:90%
May everyone here in the studio,

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:32.711 align:middle line:84%
may George be blessed
with great tidings.

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:35.047 align:middle line:84%
I summon all of our
spirit guides

00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:39.184 align:middle line:84%
to give us love,
wisdom and strength.

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:42.454 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:46.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, can somebody do
this and not be a witch?

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:47.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Absolutely.

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
It's, people call it conjuring
spell work, but it comes

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.099 align:middle line:84%
down to one thing the most
powerful thing in the world all

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:57.102 align:middle line:90%
of us have is prayer and love.

00:23:57.102 --> 00:24:01.106 align:middle line:84%
You put those two things
together you're unstoppable.

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:02.975 align:middle line:90%
It's what gives you energy.

00:24:02.975 --> 00:24:06.778 align:middle line:84%
>> So when little ones dress
up in costumes for Halloween.

00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:07.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes, they do.

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.281 align:middle line:84%
>> And maybe they
come to your house

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.616 align:middle line:90%
and you give them their candy.

00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:11.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
So much candy.

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:13.385 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you dressed as?

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:14.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Okay.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Those are two different things.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.622 align:middle line:90%
You're talking about Halloween.

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:17.456 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:18.724 align:middle line:90%
I'll let you put that out again.

00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:22.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Okay,
thank you for your blessings.

00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:24.796 align:middle line:84%
All right sometimes I
might want to be fun

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:26.798 align:middle line:90%
and dress like something -

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:27.733 align:middle line:90%
>> -- exotic?

00:24:27.733 --> 00:24:29.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Exotic and fun

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:30.602 align:middle line:84%
for the kids, this
is for the kids.

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:32.271 align:middle line:84%
I'll dress up like
a gorilla if I have

00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:34.039 align:middle line:90%
to to make them laugh, you know?

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:38.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a magic, there is
some simple magic and joy

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.078 align:middle line:90%
that comes out of Halloween.

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:41.813 align:middle line:84%
It's sad when you
can't appreciate it.

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:43.115 align:middle line:90%
It's candy.

00:24:43.115 --> 00:24:45.684 align:middle line:84%
People are giving away free
candy and there's a trust.

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:47.319 align:middle line:84%
That's what the magic
of Halloween -

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.453 align:middle line:90%
>> -- there is a trust.

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:49.888 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: It's a trust.

00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:52.391 align:middle line:84%
I'm sending my kids because I
am a mother, sending my kids

00:24:52.391 --> 00:24:54.359 align:middle line:84%
to your house and you're
going to feed them.

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:56.662 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been some
sickos though; you know that.

00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:57.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Yes,
and that is unfortunate.

00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:58.764 align:middle line:90%
That -

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:00.699 align:middle line:84%
>> -- that is where
you bring out that.

00:25:00.699 --> 00:25:01.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: This.

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:04.002 align:middle line:90%
Sickos that hurt children.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.339 align:middle line:90%
There's a trust in Halloween,

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:10.375 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be a
part of that magic.

00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:12.711 align:middle line:90%
You know, I don't -

00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>> -- are you always around the
Salem area when this happens?

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I am.

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:18.083 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very into
the Salem area

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:20.385 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I've missed
Halloweens with my kids,

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:24.122 align:middle line:84%
which was sad, because
I'm a working witch

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:25.457 align:middle line:90%
which is different.

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:28.627 align:middle line:84%
I run my own events in Salem,
I run my own stuff, but -

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.195 align:middle line:84%
>> -- do you get a
lot of tourists there?

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:31.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
So many tourists

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:35.834 align:middle line:84%
and let me tell you every year
Salem hosts a beautiful parade

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:38.537 align:middle line:84%
in which we walk in and I
get the pleasure of dressing

00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:40.172 align:middle line:90%
up fun just like everyone else.

00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:43.108 align:middle line:84%
>> You fly in on a broom
or are you in a car?

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:44.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: I fly

00:25:44.343 --> 00:25:46.712 align:middle line:84%
in on usually a convertible
which is even better.

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:47.846 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.247 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another call
from one of our viewers.

00:25:49.247 --> 00:25:49.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Okay.

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:50.315 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:51.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Here we go.

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:52.984 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, Leanne, I was
wondering do witches

00:25:52.984 --> 00:25:55.053 align:middle line:90%
and warlocks get along together?

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:56.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Absolutely.

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:59.024 align:middle line:84%
Witches and warlocks
definitely get along together.

00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:01.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like husband
and wife, right?

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:02.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Just like
husband and wife but not quite.

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:04.129 align:middle line:84%
>> But sometimes
they don't get along.

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:05.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Like
best friends, witches

00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:08.166 align:middle line:84%
and warlocks absolutely
do get along together.

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:15.774 align:middle line:84%
Warlock is the word for male
witch conjurer or necromancer.

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Witches, it's a
fascinating field.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: It
is a fascinating field.

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:21.279 align:middle line:84%
>> What about children who
want to dabble in this?

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:23.181 align:middle line:90%
Do you encourage it or not?

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:26.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Well,
every parent has to,

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:29.388 align:middle line:84%
they have to honestly
take that on their own.

00:26:29.388 --> 00:26:33.658 align:middle line:84%
>> I would guess, Leanne,
most parents would freak

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:36.928 align:middle line:84%
if they knew their kid
wanted to study witchcraft.

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
It's just a religion.

00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:39.231 align:middle line:90%
It's believing in -

00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:40.065 align:middle line:90%
>> -- but don't you agree?

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:41.466 align:middle line:90%
They freak?

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:43.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Some do, some
do freak, but most of, I think -

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:46.204 align:middle line:84%
>> -- you don't seem to
be a bad person at all.

00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:47.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: No.

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:48.573 align:middle line:84%
>> -- you actually
would probably be fun.

00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:51.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I go to
church, I sit in the woods,

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:56.181 align:middle line:84%
we have a coven meeting in which
we talk about who we're going

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:58.784 align:middle line:84%
to help and who we're going to
heal and what we need to get rid

00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:02.421 align:middle line:84%
of in our lives and we
connect with the seasons.

00:27:02.421 --> 00:27:04.189 align:middle line:90%
All of that is great for kids.

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:07.192 align:middle line:84%
Paganism and witchcraft is
not a bad path for kids.

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no words of the devil.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.997 align:middle line:84%
We don't hurt animals,
we honor animals.

00:27:11.997 --> 00:27:13.365 align:middle line:90%
It's actually safe.

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:15.233 align:middle line:84%
So that, you know,
whether or not you're going

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:19.004 align:middle line:84%
to raise your child within
the craft and if you're going

00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:21.807 align:middle line:84%
to raise your kid to
be a wiccan or however,

00:27:21.807 --> 00:27:24.976 align:middle line:84%
that's just like raising
your kids in any other faith,

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:27.512 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's a beginning
step, there's a blessing

00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:32.117 align:middle line:84%
for babies, there is a
solemn event for weddings

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:34.719 align:middle line:84%
and there's an amazing
thing that happens

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.888 align:middle line:84%
when you die we do
beautiful funerals.

00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:38.256 align:middle line:84%
So we're just like
every other faith.

00:27:38.256 --> 00:27:42.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Unlike a Satanist who
I think promotes evil.

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:44.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Not all
Satanists promote evil.

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.731 align:middle line:84%
Now, Satanists the LaVeyan
[phonetic] now you have a whole

00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:50.335 align:middle line:84%
different thing which I have
to say is completely different

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:90%
on a level of faith, all right?

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you one of them too?

00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I am
absolutely not a Satanist,

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:59.344 align:middle line:84%
but I know people who do because
Satanists if you're looking

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:00.712 align:middle line:90%
at a LaVeyan Satanist -

00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:01.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Anton LaVeyan.

00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:05.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Anton
LaVeyan, they're actually,

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:10.088 align:middle line:84%
they believe in the
worshipping of self, okay,

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:12.057 align:middle line:84%
that you put yourself
on a pedestal,

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:13.959 align:middle line:90%
that you take care of yourself.

00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:18.129 align:middle line:84%
It would be un-Satanic
to hurt anybody

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:22.067 align:middle line:84%
because it would not make
sense with their religion

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:24.369 align:middle line:84%
because what it is it's
to put man above itself

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:25.737 align:middle line:90%
and not disrespect other men.

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.739 align:middle line:90%
>> But they worship the devil?

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:29.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Ah, LeVeyan
Satanists do not worship the

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:32.410 align:middle line:84%
devil if you look at them,
they worship themselves

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.612 align:middle line:90%
and the devil is more of a -

00:28:33.612 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>> -- then why do they
call themselves Satanists?

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Because
I think it's a tongue

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:40.051 align:middle line:84%
in cheek thing because they're
on some essence the energy

00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:42.921 align:middle line:90%
of Satan is self-worship.

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.055 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:49.227 align:middle line:84%
I would say Satanism is
greatly misunderstood.

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:53.565 align:middle line:84%
People I know that are LaVeyan
Satanists they love the animals,

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:56.468 align:middle line:84%
they love their kids,
they love their lives,

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:59.271 align:middle line:90%
they've never harmed anyone.

00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:03.174 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about Satan as
a living, breathing thing,

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:07.012 align:middle line:84%
which is we, you know, witches
we don't believe in the devil.

00:29:07.012 --> 00:29:10.148 align:middle line:84%
We believe evil comes
from man-made, from man.

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:11.516 align:middle line:90%
We make our own evil.

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:14.452 align:middle line:90%
We go to war because of ego.

00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:18.957 align:middle line:84%
When you eliminate love from
any situation, that's the devil.

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:21.059 align:middle line:84%
>> If I ran into you
in a supermarket,

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:22.827 align:middle line:90%
would I know you were a witch?

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:24.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Leanne Marrama: Maybe not.

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:25.363 align:middle line:90%
I just sometimes wear black.

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:26.932 align:middle line:90%
>> You just blend right in.

00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:27.766 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
I blend right in.

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:28.934 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like everybody else.

00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:32.137 align:middle line:84%
I just pray a little
different than everybody.

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:34.272 align:middle line:90%
I worship a little different.

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.674 align:middle line:90%
>> And you love people.

00:29:35.674 --> 00:29:38.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: I love people
and I'm a little extravagant.

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:42.147 align:middle line:84%
I honor my dead daily and
that's something I think

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:46.217 align:middle line:84%
that makes witches stand
out in society as a whole.

00:29:46.217 --> 00:29:50.255 align:middle line:84%
We honor the dead to such
a degree that they live

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:54.392 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, that we
bring our dead close to us.

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:57.862 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you see
I have skulls on me.

00:29:57.862 --> 00:30:01.266 align:middle line:84%
This is to bring
the dead in to me.

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:02.467 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:04.736 align:middle line:84%
Now if people want more
information on witchcraft

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.805 align:middle line:90%
from you, what do they do?

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:08.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama: Okay, if
anybody wants information

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:11.676 align:middle line:84%
on witchcraft from me, they
are more than welcome to check

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:13.645 align:middle line:90%
out my Facebook page to go

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:17.415 align:middle line:84%
to vesselofthedead.com
or hexwitch.com.

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:20.885 align:middle line:84%
I work at a wonderful
storm in Salem owned

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:90%
by Christian Day and it is -

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.388 align:middle line:90%
>> -- he loves that store.

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:24.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Leanne Marrama:
Yes, it's great.

00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:26.124 align:middle line:90%
Hex Old World Witchery.

00:30:26.124 --> 00:30:27.926 align:middle line:84%
>> How do they find
you on Facebook?

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.227 align:middle line:84%
