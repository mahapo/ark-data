think many people today

00:00:21.423 --> 00:00:23.175 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to

>>People are basically
willing to keep on,

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%

00:00:39.154 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:10%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory here
in the Los Angeles

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:10%
studios of Gaiam Television.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And with us is a very special
guest, a dear friend of ours

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast AM" and noted
book author and researcher Jim

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Sanders.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Jim, of course, has
written a couple of books,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
including "First
Strike" and also

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
"The Downing of TWA Flight 800,"
that incredible story of what

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:84%
had happened nearly
20 years ago.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:90%
A lot of us fly a lot.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm on probably 40
or 50 flights a year.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And you try to
imagine just what it's

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:84%
like to be on a plane
that is going down,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and Jim, it's gotta be one of
the most frightening feelings

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.419 align:middle line:90%
just to assume that.

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JIM SANDERS: Yeah,
just incredible.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:10%
And what happens
to you as you start

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:10%
dealing with-- since my wife was
with TWA when that went down,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:10%
and all the emotions surrounding
her as everything came in,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.264 align:middle line:10%
and they very quickly knew
that bad things were happening

00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:10%
with the federal government.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.096 align:middle line:10%
But that's at the
same time that they're

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:10%
going from funeral to funeral.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:90%
She lived in New York.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
We lived in Virginia, but
she lived in New York.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.762 align:middle line:84%
And they would take all
their extra uniforms.

00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And every time
there was a funeral,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.950 align:middle line:84%
a large representative number of
them would fly to each funeral.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine what
that did to the morale

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and the personal
thing that happened.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember that night
that TWA Flight 800 went down.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching
CNN at the time.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.660 align:middle line:90%
And they came on.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.569 align:middle line:84%
They had a little statement
from Bill Clinton,

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
and they talked about it.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
I said, Jim, was

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:84%
there was a bomb on this
plane, or something exploded.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
These things just don't go
down the way they go down.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:90%
And I never forgot that.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.901 align:middle line:90%
You must have felt the same way.

00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: We came
home from dinner.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
We were in California
at her mother's house.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we
lived in Virginia,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
but we walk in the door, and
there it's all over the screen.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It had happened probably a
half hour before we got back.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, you know
that it is going to be

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:10%
a criminal act of some kind.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:10%
The chances, just going
on logic and using

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:10%
a little mathematical skill
from the old college days,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:10%
you know that you're looking at
probably about 99.9% certainty

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:10%
that it's a nefarious
act of some sort.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we
knew that they finally

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.352 align:middle line:90%
got another plane-- finally.

00:03:11.352 --> 00:03:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in this
particular case,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
what led you to
start researching it?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because prior to that
what are some of the things

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:90%
that you had done?

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: Oh, before
that, my first book

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:10%
was "Soldiers of
Misfortune" in 1992.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And that was the book in which
I, a retired police officer,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.625 align:middle line:90%
turned Politico.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: And I left politics
because a Wall Street Journal

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
reporter gave me a
story about World War

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
II about the loss of 23,000
Americans to the Gulag.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know why.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And he'd given that story
to college professors,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and nobody was able to
come up with anything.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:84%
He says, hey, you're
a retired cop.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.727 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you this story.

00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
He gave me a lot of
information on it.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's
where I started.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:10%
That's where I began to learn
what the government does

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:10%
to try to stop you
when you have something

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:10%
that, even though
it's decades old,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:10%
they still don't
want it out there.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.979 align:middle line:84%
I assumed at that time that,
oh, well, I've got this story.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to go, hey, thanks.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:90%
That got lost in the shuffle.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.974 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:04:19.974 --> 00:04:22.456 align:middle line:10%
The battle that
then started, which

00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:10%
is why it was so
easy by the time

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:10%
we got to Malaysian Air 360 and
Flight 800, for that matter,

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:10%
to know very quickly that
the government was involved

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:10%
in conduct to hide something.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.580 align:middle line:90%
100%, yeah.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you
got into TWA Flight 800,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:90%
what was the catalyst for you?

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you normally
didn't write

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.919 align:middle line:90%
about planes that went down.

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: No, I
didn't want to write

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:90%
about planes that went down.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
got you into this?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Was it the fact that your
wife was with TWA at the time?

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Right, she
and some of our friends--

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
well, I was getting input
from some of the people that

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.920 align:middle line:84%
worked on the investigation that
would talk to people that she

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:90%
knew.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And she was in a
position where she

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:84%
knew a lot of pilots
and whatnot that were

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:90%
working on the investigation.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And I kept hearing
what was going on,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and you can see that witnesses
were being cut out of anything

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.070 align:middle line:90%
in the national media.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And so one day, I'm in Saint
Louis where she was working.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I walk in, and I
literally got ambushed

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
by probably a half a dozen
supervisors and managers

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.419 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:84%
They were standing there
talking about Flight 800

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
when I happened to
walk into the building.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.450 align:middle line:90%
And they really came after me.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:84%
I initially said, no, I'm
not going to investigate it,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.047 align:middle line:84%
because the FBI-- they'll
eventually get it right.

00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't
believe at that time--

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You hoped.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Yeah, they'll
eventually get it right.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:84%
But then within a few weeks,
I did start investigating it

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.646 align:middle line:84%
because they weren't
trying to get it right.

00:05:51.646 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:84%
They clearly were not
trying to get it right.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So it was pressure from within
TWA that got me started.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ironically,
in Saint Louis, where

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I hail most of the time
too, this plane, Flight 800,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:84%
was in Saint Louis and
was under some kind of dog

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
sniffing drug
exercise, was it not?

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: It wasn't, but
they allege that it was.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:90%
There was a 747 next to it.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:84%
There was Jack
Cashill in particular.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:84%
He co-authored my 2003 book,
"First Strike" with him.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
He did some outstanding
legwork on that,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
including interviewing
the handler of that dog.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.777 align:middle line:84%
And what we know beyond
any doubt was that that--

00:06:35.777 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Officer
Burnett was his name.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.443 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Yeah, I believe
that was his name, yes.

00:06:39.443 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
He was never on that
plane, Flight 800.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:90%
He was on the plane next to it.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because what
the government tried

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:84%
to get us to believe
was that that plane had

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:84%
bomb residue on it from
the test-- the dog sniffing

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.407 align:middle line:84%
test, which you tell
us never happened.

00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Never happened.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.729 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, the
residue they're pulling off,

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
there's as much on the
outside of the plane

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:90%
as the inside of the plane.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So it was just a bogus
story, but dominant media

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
had sold its soul by the time
we got to these kinds of things.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
They had sold
theirselves to the feds,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and they simply
couldn't go back.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, take us on
that fateful day in July 1996

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
as TWA Flight 800 begins
to leave New York.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Right, it takes off
from New York and 12 minutes

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
later, after having a normal
climb out-- but then it

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.160 align:middle line:90%
had to level off.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And let me give it to you in
the words of a key witness that

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
has never ever been talked
about by dominant media

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.080 align:middle line:90%
or the government.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
She was standing in
the West Hampton area

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:84%
on the beach with her toes
in the water looking out,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
watching Flight 800 climb
out coming towards her.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:10%
It would have been
out about eight

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:10%
miles, eight and
a half miles out,

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:10%
climbing towards her position.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And she sees it level off.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And then she sees it
start to climb again.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.120 align:middle line:10%
And then she says out of
the corner of her eye,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.460 align:middle line:10%
she sees a missile
coming up behind it.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:10%
And it looks like it's
going to miss Flight 800.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And then it turns in
and pops the plane.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And she said the
force of that blast--

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.445 align:middle line:84%
because they start to
unfold before they actually

00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:84%
hit the plane-- hit
right where the leading

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
edge of the right wing
meets the fuselage.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, before I ever
saw her statement,

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I had already analyzed
from the damage

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to get a hold
of from my inside sources

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that that's exactly
where it hit.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And then she-- this is
long before anybody else

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
knew that the front of
the plane, the cockpit,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
coming back almost to the
leading edge of the wings

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:90%
had broken off on its own.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah,
that's what happened.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So she described
perfectly what happened.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was another--
there was a fisherman,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:90%
a commercial fisherman.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
His name escapes me
but really a good guy.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:84%
He is exactly due
west of the plane.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:90%
She is north of the plane.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:90%
He is west of the plane.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And he sees the
missile come up and hit

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:90%
exactly where she describes it.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: And the
same events happen,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
but the one thing he
adds that she didn't was

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that the missile, the force of
the missile, its angle as it

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
came up through that 747, then
the force came out the top.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
McDonald's golden arches

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:90%
coming out the top.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's use this as an
example for a minute, shall we,

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:46.489 align:middle line:84%
if you would, and demonstrate
to us what happened.

00:09:46.489 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: She's
over here, and she's

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
watching the missile
come up the right side,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
look like it's going to
miss, come back, and hit

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
right there, right where
the leading edge hits.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you see the damage, you
see that the force of the flow

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:90%
was that way.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up and
blows out the top.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So how did the government
manage to cover that up?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.655 align:middle line:84%
The floor, what's
called the center wing

00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
tank, this whole area in
here is the fuel tank.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
The floor of that,
they altered it,

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and I have pictures
proving this.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
They altered it by cutting
off the upward bending

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.680 align:middle line:84%
pieces of the floor of
the center wing tank,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
because of the blast from
external to internal.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:84%
They cut off the pieces that
were blown upwards and put

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:90%
everything else back in there.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I got arrested
for this, the judge

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
ordered them to let me have
three hours of taking photos.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I have photos of
where they cut it off.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing a couple feet
from where they made the cuts.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So a missile
has-- was this-- could this

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
have been a rocket
launcher on your shoulder?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: No.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:90%
The damage was far too great.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.330 align:middle line:90%
The altitude was too high.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And from a missile scientist,
a retired missile scientist,

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:84%
who at that time that
I interviewed him down

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:84%
in Virginia Beach, he
thought he was dying.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.046 align:middle line:84%
He thought he had
terminal cancer.

00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
So he had no fears of the
government whatsoever.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:10%
And he took-- looked at
everything that I had,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:10%
including the elements from the
foam rubber piece that I got,

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:10%
the forensic evidence
that I had developed.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said what this
is telling you is

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
that this was a Navy missile.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:10%
It's evidence of a solid fuel
missile because of this, this,

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:10%
this, and this.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But unique to the Navy
in the entire world

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:90%
was an incendiary warhead.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.439 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else had it in 1996.

00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And he says those are the
exact elements that you would

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:84%
find in residue from an
incendiary warhead fired

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:90%
by our own Navy.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now clearly,
clearly our Navy

00:11:55.157 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to intentionally
take this plane down.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.948 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Oh no.

00:11:57.948 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:90%
No, I can't imagine.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think happened?

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.378 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: I believe
that what happened--

00:12:02.378 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and there's very
good evidence of it.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:84%
One thing we know
is that Ramzi Yousef

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:84%
was on trial in the Southern
District of New York.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Manhattan Island.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mr Bojinka.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: He had run-- well,
the FBI ran a scam on him.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:10%
He got a cellphone that he
was using from inside prison

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.890 align:middle line:10%
to call the Middle East to
tell them that he needed to,

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:10%
on that exact date, he needed
to have an airliner blown out

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.267 align:middle line:10%
of the sky inside of New
York because his trial wasn't

00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:34.100 align:middle line:10%
going well, and that
would cause a mistrial.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:35.543 align:middle line:10%
How bizarre is that?

00:12:35.543 --> 00:12:39.270 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: And the FBI,
he was using a language

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:10%
that they didn't
immediately have

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:10%
people to do the translation.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure what
the time element was,

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
but they later
found out about it,

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:84%
that that is what he
had done that day.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:90%
So he orders it.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Gee, wouldn't that
put you about 99.999%

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.190 align:middle line:90%
certain that it was a missile?

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
What happened was the Navy
was out there in force.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:10.056 align:middle line:84%
And as part of a prevent,
they had a brand new system

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:90%
that they were just--

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.722 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they weren't
out there doing exercises

00:13:12.722 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:13.673 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: No.

00:13:13.673 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were there to
prevent a hijacking, bombing

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:18.902 align:middle line:90%
of a plane, missile.

00:13:18.902 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And having exercises as
their official reason

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:90%
for being out there.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:10%
And there is evidence--
It's not overwhelming,

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:10%
but there's evidence that they
had a plane to take a shot at,

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:10%
and the missile went through TWA
800 to try to get to the plane.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
an onshore witness,

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and you have an airborne witness
that gives you the evidence

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.782 align:middle line:90%
that a plane was in the area.

00:13:49.782 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another plane?

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.448 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: Another
plane was in the area.

00:13:52.448 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:10%
It was seen by a Navy senior
NCO who was on a US Air flight.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.182 align:middle line:10%
It almost hit him directly.

00:13:59.182 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What kind
of plane was it?

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: It was a twin engine.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.336 align:middle line:10%
And this is all
they can describe.

00:14:03.336 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:10%
He says it came within about
300 feet of his seat, literally.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:90%
As US Air 217 is--

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this plane
supposed to ram TWA Flight 800?

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: Yeah, I think if
this was the target plane--

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.100 align:middle line:10%
and I personally think
it was-- this guy,

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.492 align:middle line:10%
he's looking for his
72 virgins, which

00:14:22.492 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:10%
was the stories they were
telling at that time.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And he sees that he's about
to ram a very small plane--

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:84%
because US Air 217 is a
commuter plane-- at 21,000 feet.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And he goes underneath it.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:10%
So he either deliberately
missed or accidentally missed.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.680 align:middle line:84%
TWA Flight 800, this big
ol' wide body humping

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:84%
down there about another
6- 7,000 feet below.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.459 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was the target
of this plane, right?

00:14:49.459 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Ended up
being the target.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.745 align:middle line:84%
It dives, and we
have a shore witness

00:14:53.745 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
that sees a plane diving on TWA
Flight 800 from the left side,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.767 align:middle line:90%
making a high G turn.

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:90%
This is a comedy of horror here.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yeah.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this missile
coming on the right side that's

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:90%
chasing this other plane.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this a suicide
mission of this plane?

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of the other plane?

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:90%
And facts unfolded then.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Because there is equal evidence
of another significant event

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
plane, from the other side

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:90%
of the left wing, and underside.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.674 align:middle line:84%
And again, I was right there
within-- I could touch where

00:15:28.674 --> 00:15:29.840 align:middle line:90%
these things were happening.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.381 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to that plane?

00:15:31.381 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Did it indeed hit
TWA Flight 800?

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well, it didn't,
but it disintegrated.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:90%
It disintegrated.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.087 align:middle line:84%
Either another missile
hit it, or the guy--

00:15:40.087 --> 00:15:41.753 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which was
the original target--

00:15:41.753 --> 00:15:42.544 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Ignited.

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By the Navy?

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
They were out
there to shoot down

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
what they thought was a plane
that was going to hit a plane.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.912 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That missile ended
up hitting TWA Flight 800.

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:84%
If you get into any
other scenario-- which

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to-- then
the Navy looks much worse.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.646 align:middle line:84%
This is the one that
the Navy looks the best.

00:16:04.646 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Now, I got a
hold of some documents

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
through a friend of
mine, now deceased, who

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
was a reporter, that
he got from the Navy,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and they had redacted one
full paragraph of this report.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And I, a few years
later, filed to get

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:90%
that redacted information.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And I now have Navy
paperwork that tells me

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:84%
that they destroyed all
TWA documents in July 2003.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:90%
And this was a--

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's dramatic.

00:16:38.648 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: And what we know
is that this paragraph was

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.800 align:middle line:10%
describing the ships that
were in the immediate area,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:10%
according to the Navy's own
documents, of TWA Flight 800.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
We know that's
what was redacted.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't
they come out and just

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:90%
simply tell us the truth?

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:90%
How many people would get upset?

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, it would
be shocking to hear,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
but I think the American
people, Jim, would appreciate

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:84%
government saying--
Listen to me,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.880 align:middle line:84%
there was an attack
on that plane,

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:84%
and our Navy was
out there because we

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:16.839 align:middle line:84%
had prior information
that something was

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:90%
going to happen to some plane.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And we had missiles
ready to do this.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.389 align:middle line:84%
And our missile
took the plane down.

00:17:25.389 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:90%
It was going to go down anyway.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:84%
It was going to get hit by this
other plane, but we did it.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a horrible accident.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Why can't they just say that?

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.099 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well, initially,
and it's taken me years--

00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:39.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because wouldn't
you accept that more

00:17:39.015 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:90%
as an American?

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't you say, you know what?

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not happy about it--

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.761 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: If they had
done it on a timely basis.

00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right away.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Right away.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.047 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right, well--

00:17:48.047 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Same with the plane
that I think they shot down

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.994 align:middle line:90%
in Pennsylvania during 911.

00:17:51.994 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Absolutely.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:84%
I started to investigate that,
but that's another story.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.902 align:middle line:84%
You're absolutely
right on that one.

00:17:57.902 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
The one in Pennsylvania took a
missile without any question.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:10%
But every minute that
ticked by in which the White

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.964 align:middle line:10%
House did not fess up that--

00:18:08.964 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It got worse.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.338 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: And the
initial decision

00:18:11.338 --> 00:18:12.810 align:middle line:10%
they made-- and we know this.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:10%
Fox News was a brand
new organization,

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:10%
but they had a three person crew
out on Long Island that night.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:10%
A marine major came up to the
leader of that three person

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:10%
group-- it was a lady--
and confided in her,

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:10%
not for attribution, that the
White House had been given

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:10%
a look busy but stand
down for 48 hours

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:10%
while we decide how we're
going to handle this.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:10%
So right there you
know that a-- the most

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:10%
Machiavellian bunch
ever in history,

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:10%
and they made a decision.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:90%
They clearly made a decision.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a presidential
election going on right

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:90%
now that we lose control of.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're
doing pretty good.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
We lose control if we
go ahead and fess up.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just let things
slide for a while.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.140 align:middle line:90%
And they let things slide.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.021 align:middle line:90%
It was August.

00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's a precise
day in August.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
As I recall, it was
August 12th in which

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Jim Kallstrom, the head of the
FBI, part of the investigation,

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.500 align:middle line:84%
was given marching
orders that it

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.599 align:middle line:90%
was going to be a mechanical.

00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
conclusion they wanted.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.098 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:19:21.098 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And we know who
gave him the orders.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
It was from the
Department of Justice.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
He was given very-- there
was a very senior-- I think

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.560 align:middle line:84%
it was the number two
person, as I recall,

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.560 align:middle line:84%
at the Department of
Justice-- I'm not remembering

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:84%
her name right now--
who was put in charge

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.307 align:middle line:90%
of making all this happen.

00:19:39.307 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a sad event.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Yeah,
a very sad event.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're coming
up now on 20 years.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: 20 years in July.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's never going--

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: July of 16, I guess.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:90%
17.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:84%
July 17, 1996, so
it would take--

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:84%
there's things I
can't say right now,

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.590 align:middle line:84%
things that I know but I
can't talk about right now,

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and won't be able to, probably,
for another couple of years.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We can't beat it
out of you with bamboo?

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.176 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: You probably could,
because I can't stand pain.

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, during
this investigation,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:90%
you got in trouble.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
You got in trouble because
you had some evidence.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:25.610 align:middle line:90%
You had some samples.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about what
happened there.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.056 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: I had
multiple informants

00:20:31.056 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:84%
on the inside,
one that was right

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
next to Louis Freeh, the
head of the FBI, I mean,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
in his inner circle, that
was feeding me information.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:90%
But I had one.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:90%
We called him "Hangerman."

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.020 align:middle line:90%
It was Terry Stacey.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.240 align:middle line:10%
It came out eventually.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.590 align:middle line:10%
He handled all 747
pilots, so he became

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.250 align:middle line:10%
part of the investigation
as a TWA person.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:10%
And when I was looking
for people on the inside,

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:10%
I would talk to the
folks inside TWA

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:10%
that knew all the
people that were

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:10%
from TWA that were in there.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And he was the person
that was pointed out to me

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.931 align:middle line:90%
as don't bother going to him.

00:21:11.931 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:90%
He is so straight arrow.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.138 align:middle line:90%
He'll never give up anything.

00:21:14.138 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's my man right there.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And over a period of time
talking to him on the phone--

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:90%
Liz introduced us on the phone.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And talking to him, within a
few weeks he said, I've had it.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And literally, this
was almost a quote.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I have had it.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:90%
There's a cover up going on.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's get
together and talk.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And from there, he
started giving me

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
documents that showed what
was going on on the inside.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And eventually he
goes, there is a path

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
of residue across TWA
Flight 800 in the seats

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:90%
that were recovered.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:58.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a reddish orange, and it's
in rows 17, 18, and 19, maybe

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:90%
some other places.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:90%
17, 18, 19 is right where--

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right where it is.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Right where it exploded.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Right
where the missile hit.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:90%
And a reddish orange?

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Hmm?

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.445 align:middle line:84%
I said, let's see, when
you see missile shots

00:22:09.445 --> 00:22:11.467 align:middle line:84%
and the residue coming
out of the back end

00:22:11.467 --> 00:22:12.925 align:middle line:84%
of solid fuel
missiles, that's kind

00:22:12.925 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:90%
of reddish orange at night.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I
started developing it.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And then one day he said to me
that if you'll get it tested,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll get you a sample.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I had a First
Amendment lawyer that

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
was on the payroll of the Press
Enterprise here in California.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
That guy was
monitoring what I did

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
before we put
anything out having

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.340 align:middle line:90%
to do with my investigation.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:84%
That lawyer, that's what this
job was-- First Amendment.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:84%
That's his whole job--
freedom of the press.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:90%
That's all it was.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:10%
He said two things-- one,
everything you're doing

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:10%
is legal, and here's
how to keep it legal.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
was, everything

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.945 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you has no merit
if they're out of control,

00:23:02.945 --> 00:23:05.320 align:middle line:84%
if the Justice Department and
the FBI are out of control.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they want you,
they're going to get to you.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: They're
going to get you.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:90%
But you're doing it legal.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And if this is just
an investigation where

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.975 align:middle line:84%
they're screwing up
and don't realize it,

00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and you catch them in the
act and that kind of thing,

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:90%
you'll be fine.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, you are
going to get run over.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you got run over.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: And I got run over,
and my wife got run over.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, she did too.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:90%
She did too.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
You said she was
based in Saint Louis.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Did she live out that way?

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.526 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Yeah, well, she was
actually based in New York,

00:23:29.526 --> 00:23:33.587 align:middle line:84%
but she was on semi-permanent
assignment in Saint Louis.

00:23:33.587 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
the hub for a while.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:35.878 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:23:35.878 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:84%
She gave recurrent training
to all the flight attendants

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:90%
and pilots.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.821 align:middle line:84%
There was a section that the
pilots did every year, too,

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:90%
and the flight attendants did.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's where she was working.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.791 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She probably
knows a lot of people

00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I know who were with TWA.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Yeah, virtually
everyone that was on there.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they also about
the old Ozark Airlines,

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.242 align:middle line:84%
merged that in with
everything else.

00:23:55.242 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the bottom line here
was, in your opinion, a Navy

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
missile by accident trying to
shoot down another plane that,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:84%
ironically, was
trying to take down

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:84%
a plane that turned out
to be TWA Flight 800,

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:90%
took down TWA Flight 800.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Now here's my question.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Had the Navy not
been there, do you

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:84%
think that these terrorists
who had this two engine plane

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:84%
would have been successful in
taking down TWA Flight 800?

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:90%
They would have crashed?

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yes.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:84%
See, the Navy had
this, what's called

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:84%
a CEC program, cooperative
engagement capability, that all

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful technology
was coming together--

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:90%
the software and the hardware.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.610 align:middle line:84%
CEC was designed
so that they could

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:54.500 align:middle line:84%
steam into any area of the world
and conduct major operations--

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.489 align:middle line:90%
shooting down planes.

00:24:55.489 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:10%
And there could be commercial
airliners in there,

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:10%
because remember when
they accidentally

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:10%
shot down the plane
over in the Middle East?

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And so this was the
answer to that problem.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was in its final
stages before being signed off

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:90%
for combat.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.510 align:middle line:90%
This is July of 1996.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It went away as a program
right after this happened.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was only in the last
year that it got signed off.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.577 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:25:23.577 --> 00:25:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
that's another one.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: And the
"Seawolf," which

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:84%
was a submarine that was
going through its last stages

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
of whatever it is the Navy
does before it accepts a ship,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:84%
it had an underwater
capability for firing

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.330 align:middle line:84%
anti-aircraft missiles--
first time in the history.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:10%
The Navy has never
admitted that it had it,

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:56.710 align:middle line:10%
but I had the missile expert
who was dying of cancer,

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.980 align:middle line:10%
he thought, at the time.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
He had had an above top secret
clearance into these programs.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, wait a minute.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I know the chief
of a boat that now

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.960 align:middle line:84%
works for, I think
it was Sperry over

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.640 align:middle line:90%
in Charlottesville, Virginia.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:10%
And he would know
all about this.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:90%
And so he calls him up.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there with my
lawyer, at the time,

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:84%
a friendly lawyer from my
political days who was there.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And we could hear both
ends of the conversation.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.782 align:middle line:84%
And he, the lawyer-- I
still have the notes.

00:26:30.782 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
He was taking notes
of what was going on.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.004 align:middle line:84%
The chief of the boat,
without any hesitation,

00:26:35.004 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:84%
says, oh yeah. "Seawolf's"
got this wonderful thing,

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's a swivel tube
fired from underwater,

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and it hooks into
the CEC system.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:90%
And he goes on and on about it.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we got that
information from there.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you it was
part of the operation that

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:90%
failed that night.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:10%
It went back to port.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:84%
There were a few
little articles that

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
said the software program--
combat software program had

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
massively failed, which I
believe that to be correct.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.726 align:middle line:84%
And I knew somebody on the
base in Groton, Connecticut--

00:27:12.726 --> 00:27:14.142 align:middle line:84%
Gro-tun, Grott-un,
whatever it was

00:27:14.142 --> 00:27:17.500 align:middle line:84%
called-- Groton, Connecticut,
that kept track of that boat

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.430 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was under wraps and
being massively overhauled

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
in some manner for
about six months.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, didn't
somebody also report

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.456 align:middle line:84%
seeing a Navy ship
fleeing the area?

00:27:30.456 --> 00:27:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Yes.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rather than coming to
this crash site near the ocean?

00:27:33.795 --> 00:27:36.169 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Right, and somebody
from within the government

00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:90%
sent me the radar tapes.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:84%
There were some radar
tapes out there.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Sent me some really
detailed radar tapes.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I can't divulge who that
person was, obviously.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.080 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the phone trying to get
explanations because there is

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:90%
an obvious Navy presence there.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:90%
You see ships in formation.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:84%
You see the cruise
missiles that are

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.450 align:middle line:84%
in this pretend exercise
that are going out there

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:90%
in attack mode.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And you see the CEC, the radars,
the Aegis radars light up

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.521 align:middle line:84%
like balloons out
there and then go down

00:28:12.521 --> 00:28:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to where you can't
see them anymore.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.230 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff is going
on, and here comes

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.780 align:middle line:90%
Flight 800 in the middle of it.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Flight 800 gets shot down.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.990 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
three blips showing

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:90%
a missile coming after it.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's picked up by
three different radar--

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:90%
civilian radars.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I guess, and I've
got to tell you, Jim, it's

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:90%
sobering.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:38.120 align:middle line:84%
It's sad but sobering to know
that it was an accidental shoot

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
down as opposed to
believing that terrorists

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.702 align:middle line:84%
were on some boat and were
able to take it down that way.

00:28:46.702 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Well, I'm
absolutely certain that it

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.690 align:middle line:84%
was political expediency
that caused the order

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.860 align:middle line:90%
to be given to the Navy.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the Navy
on its own-- it couldn't.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't think, I
know the Navy on its own

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.590 align:middle line:90%
couldn't make this happen.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It could have only come out
of the National Security

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.535 align:middle line:84%
Council that's headed by
the President and the Vice

00:29:02.535 --> 00:29:03.035 align:middle line:90%
President.

00:29:03.035 --> 00:29:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I would
assume, had the two engine

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.140 align:middle line:84%
plane been successful to
collide with TWA Flight

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.100 align:middle line:84%
800 with the Navy
not even there,

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.734 align:middle line:84%
that they would have said it
was just a midair collision.

00:29:13.734 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
would have said

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.515 align:middle line:90%
it was a plot by Ramzi Yousef.

00:29:17.515 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDERS: Oh, I can't
imagine that they would have

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:90%
ever, ever admitted to that.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody
ever gotten to Ramzi?

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.215 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he's still in jail.

00:29:25.215 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Oh, yes.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Who's the author?

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.826 align:middle line:84%
He's been on your program
several times as I recall.

00:29:29.826 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Peter Lance.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Peter Lance, right.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:37.050 align:middle line:84%
He got to him and
has at least one

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:84%
really nice book out on the
subject, from many years

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:90%
ago, obviously.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he did some
really great invest--

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't
admit everything.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Mr Yousef kind of held back.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.021 align:middle line:90%
Peter's got his own theories.

00:29:51.021 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDERS: Yeah,
we know for certain

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:10%
that he was calling
the Middle East.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
of Greg Scarpa Jr,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I think, who was right
next to him in a cell.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: Right, exactly.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:10%
And getting those
transcripts, I imagine

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.380 align:middle line:10%
it would be the
50th anniversary.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:10%
50 years right now
is the cutoff date.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:84%
If anything past 50
years that doesn't

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:15.010 align:middle line:84%
have to do with nuclear, it's
supposed to be an automatic.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you from
recent experience

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.920 align:middle line:84%
that when I filed certain
mandatory requests here

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.722 align:middle line:84%
within the last year, that
the feds ran over to Congress

00:30:25.722 --> 00:30:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and were trying to
get it extended.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.154 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want to get it out.

00:30:30.154 --> 00:30:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Good work, by the way.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.986 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDERS: OK, thanks.

00:30:31.986 --> 00:30:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim Sanders,
he's out there.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.120 align:middle line:90%
He's a watchdog.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.390 align:middle line:10%
He took the heat for his
work on TWA Flight 800,

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:10%
but it's a straight,
compelling story,

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.300 align:middle line:10%
and I'm glad you heard part
of it here on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:31:02.528 align:middle line:90%
