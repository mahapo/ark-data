00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Since the beginning
of time, humankind

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:84%
has been fascinated
with objects in the sky.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:10%
We call them UFOs.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
One such individual
has never given up

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:90%
in his quest to find the truth.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
His name is Steve Bassett, and
he's the Executive Director

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Paradigm
Research Group, which

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:84%
he founded in 1996 to end the
government imposed embargo

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:84%
on the truth behind
extraterrestrial-related

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Steve, welcome to
"Beyond Belief".

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHEN BASSETT: Always
great to be with you, George.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have talked to
you now for almost 20 years

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:90%
about this subject.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Maybe even 22, 23.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
never given up.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Because I believe
the extraterrestrial presence is

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:10%
the most important issue
in the world today,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:10%
and that the embargo on it
is a political decision which

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.808 align:middle line:10%
long ago ran its course.

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And it is time for
the world's people

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:84%
to know they're not alone,
know there's extraterrestrials

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:84%
here now, so that we
can all collectively

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:84%
deal with it instead
of a few people

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:90%
operating within black programs.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've seen
your evolution

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.970 align:middle line:84%
as well over these years,
where we thought we were

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:90%
getting close to disclosure.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:84%
You were getting
more information.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But this time period,
I've never felt so close

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.835 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility
of disclosure.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about that?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: I agree.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Over the last 22 years--

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't predict a year or
date-- but I would say, look,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.163 align:middle line:84%
things are looking
promising, and then they

00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
weren't so promising, and then
they were and they weren't.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:84%
There have been a few attempts
to maybe get something going.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Right now, though, we're in a
very special circumstance that

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:90%
could mean we're very close.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:84%
However, it's a very
complicated circumstance,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
which is why I'm glad to be
here to try to maybe sort it out

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.882 align:middle line:90%
for your viewers.

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
some new organizations

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that are cropping up
as well, some of them

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:84%
well-funded, to investigate
the UFOs and the truth embargo.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
One-- the latest one,
of course, was developed

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:90%
by Blink 182's Tom DeLonge.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yes, let's
talk about that.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
That is very, very significant,
and I've gone to great lengths

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand
it as much as possible.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But first let me
preface it with this.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.982 align:middle line:84%
You may remember that we
used to read about history--

00:02:39.982 --> 00:02:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I think I recall people
would actually study history.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people
would study that.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yeah,
that's right, and you'd

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:84%
read these books about
the amazing things that

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
have happened in the past,
extraordinary historical

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:90%
events.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.607 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to forget, though,
that there were people living

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
during those events
that in many cases,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
they didn't even
know it was going on.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
They only had little
bits and pieces of it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:90%
because it's real time.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:90%
That's something happening now.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:84%
An extraordinary historical
event is underway,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.905 align:middle line:84%
and most people don't
fully grasp it yet

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
because they're only
seeing a little bit here

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit there.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm going to
try to parse out for you.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And the first hint that
something was happening

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:90%
comes in March the 27th of 2016.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And it is when your colleague,
obviously, and Sunday host,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
the great George Knapp--

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.877 align:middle line:84%
there's few people in this
field or touches this issue

00:03:36.877 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that I have greater
respect for than George.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.450 align:middle line:90%
He's very much connected to it.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:10%
He invites Tom DeLonge
to come on his show.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.785 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A rock star.

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:45.585 align:middle line:10%
A rock star.

00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:46.953 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: A rock star.

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:10%
But he had been
in touch with Tom.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:10%
He knew a lot of things
that were going on.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't this
just turned up,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:10%
but it was time for Tom to
come on and essentially give us

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:10%
a hint of what was coming.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:90%
They did a four-hour show.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage people to go to,
obviously, "Coast to Coast AM"

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:84%
in the archives and listen
to this full four-hour show.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.763 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't hear it until it
maybe a couple of weeks later.

00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've
got a clip of that.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: We do.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.251 align:middle line:84%
It's when basically George Knapp
just introduces what's coming,

00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
and he says it's so well that
I thought you might enjoy it.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.259 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:10%
- It makes you wonder
what's going on here.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:10%
And into the middle of this buzz
comes Tom DeLonge a rock star,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:10%
seemingly an
improbable UFO messiah.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:10%
Could Tom DeLonge
do what generations

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:10%
of UFO researchers,
scientists, government siders,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:10%
and whistleblowers have
been unable to do--

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:10%
tell the story, dig
out the real story,

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:10%
and tell it in a way that
has not been told before.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:10%
How to make sense out of
the alleged coverup, why

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:10%
it started, how it's
been maintained,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.950 align:middle line:10%
but also to understand who
the visitors are, or more

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.800 align:middle line:10%
precisely, who the others are.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:10%
And I'm using air quotes
around the others.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:10%
That's the term used by
some of the high level

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:10%
sources developed by
musician Tom DeLonge.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:10%
The story of how he
got to where he is

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:10%
and what he has learned
so far should be a movie.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.173 align:middle line:10%
And maybe it will be a movie.

00:05:20.173 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:10%
But over the next
four hours we're

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:10%
going to hear this tale
how he started down

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.870 align:middle line:10%
this unlikely road, the dramatic
business decision he made

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.570 align:middle line:10%
about a year ago changing
the direction of his life

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:10%
and his fortune, and the amazing
series or chain of events which

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:10%
have led Tom from one insider
to another to another,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:10%
stitching together an informal
network of like-minded people

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:10%
who now seem to want the
public to know the story.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:10%
If you think you
know how it works

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:10%
or why it's been handled this
way, hold onto your seats

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:10%
because the tale you're
going to hear tonight

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:10%
will turn things upside down.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.952 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what a
tale that was, Stephen.

00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:05.493 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I'll tell you, I've
watched an awful lot of "Coast

00:06:05.493 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:90%
to Coast" shows and many others.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And I don't recall one that
had an intro quite like that.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:84%
You knew something
special was coming.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.572 align:middle line:84%
And so for the next four
hours, they did this interview.

00:06:16.572 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you,
my first reaction to it

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:90%
is I don't think so.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't--

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
know that was coming,

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:90%
that DeLonge was involved?

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.242 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: I didn't know.

00:06:25.242 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Tom DeLonge says a lot of
very interesting things.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:90%
I can only touch on a bit of it.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But he indicates that a year
prior to the show, which

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
should have been about March
of 2015, basically, he leaves--

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He leaves Blink.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And he gets
involved in a project which

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.338 align:middle line:84%
is basically centered on
the idea of secret machines,

00:06:50.338 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to do
some books and things.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:10%
He creates a company
called To the Stars.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:90%
They mention that.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets a
little more interesting,

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and he explains
how over time, he

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
starts to get meetings
with people very

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:84%
high up in the military
intelligence complex.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:10%
And of course, I'm
going Millennial,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.187 align:middle line:10%
very young-looking high
school grad getting meetings

00:07:15.187 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:10%
with very high people
in the Pentagon.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He looks young.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I'm not putting
this together, right?

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he's 42 or 43 now.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But again, he's really
a Millennial guy.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And this is not making sense.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:84%
But I'm listening
and I'm following it.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.053 align:middle line:84%
And then he talks about
something is coming.

00:07:32.053 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Things are going
to be developing.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:90%
He's got a multimedia project.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:84%
The first book is going to
be called "Secret Machines".

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:10%
And then he goes on
to talk about some

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:10%
of the things he was told,
which is interesting.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, I invite
people to completely

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
listen to this entire
episode to get a sense of it.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But this was the
teaser to the main show

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.487 align:middle line:90%
that was coming later.

00:07:56.487 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had known
for years, Steve,

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.382 align:middle line:84%
that Tom DeLonge was
interested in this field.

00:08:00.382 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes, he was.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because at
events and conferences

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:84%
that you would attend
and I would attend,

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:90%
he was always there.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:10%
And I kept saying
to myself, what

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:10%
the heck is this rock star
hanging around these events

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:10%
for?

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But after the events, he
would corner me and he'd say,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
George, tell me
about this and that.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.628 align:middle line:84%
And that was years
ago, years ago.

00:08:18.628 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:90%
And then all of a sudden, this.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: In the early '90s he
got very much involved in this.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:84%
He was working directly in
supporting some key people back

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:90%
And he sold 30 million records.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.995 align:middle line:84%
I played the guitar
when I was young.

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Clearly I didn't
practice enough.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not that well.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Not that well.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:90%
I never went to electric.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.372 align:middle line:90%
I stayed with the nylon strings.

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:40.039 align:middle line:90%
Well, and so he's got money.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
He can move around, and he has
a great interest in the subject.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, so did I in
the teenagers years.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So he had the ability to go
and do and buttonhole people

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
like yourself any
time he wanted to.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.723 align:middle line:84%
And then he steps back out
of it for a number of years.

00:08:54.723 --> 00:08:57.140 align:middle line:84%
He goes back to records, he
creates "Angels and Airwaves",

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:90%
sells more records.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he reemerges,
apparently, in that 2015 area.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we get the
appearance on "The Knapp Show".

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.140 align:middle line:84%
In other words, Tom
DeLonge is back.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.108 align:middle line:84%
The question is why,
and what's going on?

00:09:12.108 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's he looking for?

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Exactly.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:90%
What is happening here?

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Now I need to give
you some context

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:84%
in terms of where things
were politically at the time.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:84%
In 2015, as he's pursuing
this project, what we learned

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.090 align:middle line:84%
was that he was flying
around the country going

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.535 align:middle line:90%
to various events.

00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
There might be
some meeting here,

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:84%
meeting there of high level
stuff, but public could attend.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And if he could
get in, he'd get in

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and he'd try to buttonhole some
admiral, general, whatever.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he would get it.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well,
he'd buttonhole them,

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.805 align:middle line:84%
and you know, hello, and he's
letting them know he's around.

00:09:52.805 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
it's not like they're
saying, oh, hey, great,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
why don't you come
over to the Pentagon?

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But he's getting out there
and he's telling them

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
he has an idea and a concept
that he wants to pursue.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And he continues to
do that for a while.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, one of
the people that he says,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
look, why don't you come out to
an event that's taking place?

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
We can introduce the
head of the company,

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and we'll give you five
minutes of time and so forth.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they open the door

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
to this young rock star guy
with his huge interest who

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:90%
has an idea, all right?

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening
sometimes in 2015.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the meetings
start, and that

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:84%
goes through the end
of 2015 into 2016,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.552 align:middle line:84%
ultimately leading up to his
interview with George Knapp.

00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's happening
during that period?

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, the political
campaign of Hillary Clinton

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:90%
gets going very early 2015.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:84%
A lot is going on
during that period.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she was
interested in this field.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well, she's
always been interested,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.470 align:middle line:84%
but she didn't want to
talk about it while she

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:90%
ran for president.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately--

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.208 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People put
that to the side.

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: But
unfortunately, there's

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
this guy named Steve Bassett who
has basically been on her heels

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:90%
for 20 years.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And Grant Cameron as well.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.540 align:middle line:84%
We have the documents confirming
the Rockefeller Initiative.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.660 align:middle line:90%
We put them out.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.700 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying to
connect them to the issue.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
have made statements.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So they've always stayed
hooked to the issue

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:90%
through those years.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But now it's time to
run for president,

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.713 align:middle line:84%
and we don't need
to talk about it.

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:84%
We just get to the
White House, except--

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then we'll
talk about it.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Then
we'll talk about it.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.853 align:middle line:84%
But in 2013, as you recall,
I produced a citizen hearing

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:90%
on disclosure in Washington.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.957 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great
"Disclosure" here.

00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Five days,
30 hours of testimony,

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.682 align:middle line:90%
42 witnesses, 10 countries.

00:11:34.682 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And on the very first
day was three hours

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:84%
of testimony on the
Rockefeller Initiative

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and the connection between
that three-year effort

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and the Clintons, Hillary and
her husband, President Clinton.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And that testimony was
then part of a DVD set

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
which I used to launch
the political initiative

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.500 align:middle line:90%
on the campaign.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of a
four-year plan project.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And so in November, I
delivered a full set

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.190 align:middle line:84%
of the DVD's testimony
of the citizen hearing

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to every member of Congress
with that key testimony

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:90%
about the Clintons.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:90%
I went to Washington.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:90%
I had a bit of money back then.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I hired a legendary publicist
named Janet Donovan, who's

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:84%
known all over town, who
I use when I can pay her,

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:90%
which is not often.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And I arrived in town, I
started going up on the Hill.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea
is we're going

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:84%
to push the story of the
connection between this leading

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:84%
candidate for president
and the ET issue,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:84%
going all the way back to
the Rockefeller Initiative.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get stories about it,

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.218 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
get those going.

00:12:37.218 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It happened.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And once
the stories started

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:84%
getting written,
what would happen

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.450 align:middle line:84%
is the journalist
would write the story--

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.325 align:middle line:90%
and it's appropriate.

00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
"Washington Times",

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:90%
we're talking big papers.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:84%
They naturally go to the
principals for their comments.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And so these reporters would
call up Clinton's office

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and say, would you
comment on this?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And basically they got back
nada, meaning no comment.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
want to get involved.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And
then the reporters

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.667 align:middle line:84%
would call me and say,
they're not responding.

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So they write the
stories anyway.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
This issue had
caught up with them

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.753 align:middle line:90%
and they weren't going away.

00:13:09.753 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
embarrassed with the issue?

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Not embarrassed.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:84%
They'd been talking
about it for years.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is is Bill Clinton
could have been the disclosure

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:90%
president.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Rockefeller was there.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:90%
He was backing it.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot going on.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:90%
But this was '93, '94, '95.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was stonewalled by the
military intelligence complex.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:90%
They just stonewalled him.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the Air Force did
a report to please him,

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:90%
but it was a whitewash report.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:90%
A lot happened back then.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
he was not going

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:90%
to be the disclosure president.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:84%
They did the same thing
with Jimmy Carter.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But there were key people that
knew about that whole period.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.775 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it was
Hillary Clinton

00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and George Stephanopoulos and
Leon Panetta, Bill Webster.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
They all knew about it, but they
all had political ambitions.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And so once the
project ended, it

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:84%
was let's never
speak of this again,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
at least until, eventually,
Podesta spoke out in 2002.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And so all of that is happening.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Bush
becomes president.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But then she runs for
president in 2008.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I did get a
little bit of news

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.375 align:middle line:84%
out there about the connection
between her and the ET issue.

00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:84%
She thought she
was going to win,

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and I think if she had won,
she was going to disclose.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
She was going to
force it out in order

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:84%
to obtain the legacy design
that was denied to her husband.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:90%
But she lost again.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She lost.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And then there's
a whole thing that goes on,

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:84%
the Obama Administration,
and eight years later

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.337 align:middle line:90%
it's another run.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, but she
becomes Secretary of State,

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.517 align:middle line:84%
so why doesn't she
work on it then?

00:14:35.517 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well we don't
know what happened.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.170 align:middle line:10%
I do know this, that
it's interesting

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:10%
that when Obama
wins the election,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.300 align:middle line:10%
the first thing he does is hire
Podesta to be his transition

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:10%
co-chair.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.240 align:middle line:10%
He was involved in the
Rockefeller Initiative.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:10%
They pick her to be
the Secretary of State.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:10%
She was involved in the
Rockefeller Initiative,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:10%
knew all about it.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:10%
They picked Leon Panetta,
who was the chief of staff

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.863 align:middle line:10%
to Clinton, to be
Defense Secretary.

00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:10%
In other other words, they
brought a whole bunch of people

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:10%
well aware of what happened.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.398 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you may
recall, much later,

00:15:04.398 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
toward the end of the
Obama Administration,

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
he suddenly hires
Podesta to come in

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
to be a top advisor
to him for 14 months,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:90%
and nobody ever knew why, OK?

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.428 align:middle line:90%
So the whole story is huge.

00:15:16.428 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a reporter
talking to me now.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
We may actually get this
whole thing written up.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:84%
The point is that come the time
for her to be in the election,

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:90%
the news is starting to break.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, Podesta
had a major problem.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:37.325 align:middle line:84%
Can we continue to stonewall
the these reporters

00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
as all these articles
will be alleging?

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it stonewalling?

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Oh, yeah.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It was like, they ain't talking.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:90%
They did careful presentation.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.290 align:middle line:84%
"Jimmy Kimmel Show",
"Colbert Show".

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.272 align:middle line:84%
An interview to a
particular reporter.

00:15:53.272 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
They certainly weren't going
to call up Maureen Dowd.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
laughed about it.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.693 align:middle line:84%
Like on Kimmel's show,
they kind of made it funny.

00:15:58.693 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: A little bit.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:10%
But if you watch
all of them-- and I

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:10%
have all of these
interviews on my website,

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:10%
paradigmresearchgroup.org--
you can see them all.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I assure you, Podesta made
it very clear several times.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:90%
This is serious.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:90%
She means this.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:90%
And she said the same thing.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
then engage the issue,

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.212 align:middle line:84%
but without getting
into heavy Q&A

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:84%
because that would
cause a problem,

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.753 align:middle line:90%
because they can't answer.

00:16:22.753 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
They weren't going to Q and A.
And play it down the middle,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.473 align:middle line:90%
get to the White House.

00:16:27.473 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then go for it.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And by
the time the election

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
arrived, over 400 articles
had been written in mainstream

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.005 align:middle line:90%
print about this connection.

00:16:36.005 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: 120 of
them referred to me

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
because I'm the one talking to
the reporters, which is fine.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:90%
The point is it's in play.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But didn't come up in
the primary debates.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:90%
None of the--

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you expect it to?

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: I was hoping so.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.598 align:middle line:84%
But these multimillionaire
news hosts, you know,

00:16:54.598 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
like they don't like
to take chances.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And so in spite of all
these hundreds of articles,

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:84%
they never brought it up,
which was good for them.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But no reporter
asked the questions.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Not there.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:90%
And no one could get to them.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:90%
And so they got through it, OK?

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:84%
They got through it,
and the White House

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:90%
is right in front of them.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, but let me back up.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is
developing in 2015.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
That famous tweet
on February the 13th

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:22.660 align:middle line:84%
of 2015 from Podesta, when as
he leaves his job at the White

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:84%
House to become her co-chair,
he puts out the regret tweet.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:29.530 align:middle line:84%
My biggest regret for
2014 is not, once again,

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
getting hashtag disclosure
of the UFO files.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.607 align:middle line:90%
Who does this?

00:17:33.607 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody does that.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.315 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: So all of
that is happening.

00:17:36.315 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Now guess what?

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Who's watching this?

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Over at the Pentagon,
over the CIA

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.390 align:middle line:84%
and our military
intelligence complex,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:90%
you've got a lot of people.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.775 align:middle line:84%
And I assure you there's
a lot of people over there

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that know the ET
presence is real,

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and there are people over
there that are actually dealing

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:90%
with it in the black programs.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.003 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking out their
window, and they're going,

00:17:54.003 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
article after article is turning
up here conducting this leading

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
candidate-- and she was
way ahead of everybody--

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:90%
to the ET issue.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And then she's turning up
on Kimmel, on these shows.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're thinking,
she's going to disclose.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:90%
This is coming.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:90%
This is happening.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And that could be
a problem for us.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Now again, this is all 2015.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Why is it a problem?

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
If Hillary Clinton
had won the election

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, it's time to
disclose, goes to the Pentagon

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:90%
and say, boys, time's up.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they go back.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And she'd say,
fine, I'm firing all of you.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to get
serious, you could get it done.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And if that were to happen,
and the military intelligence

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.703 align:middle line:84%
complex had stood pat, guess
what's going to happen?

00:18:37.703 --> 00:18:39.370 align:middle line:84%
The other politicians
are going to throw

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:84%
the military intelligence
complex under the bus.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be like, we
wanted to tell you, oh, yeah,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:84%
but they stonewalled us and
they stonewalled is again.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what else
are you stonewalling?

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yeah, and
all this other stuff.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And these people don't see
themselves as the bad guys.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:84%
They see themselves as the
protector of the country.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't make a lot of money,
and they're doing a good job.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And the idea they're going
to get thrown under the bus

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.442 align:middle line:84%
as being the reason
that all of this

00:19:02.442 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:90%
was held for all these years.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they've always
felt we, as the public,

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:90%
aren't ready to hear this.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Perhaps, but a
lot of them did think that.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
The point is that from a PR
standpoint, it was not good.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they were already
thinking about what can we

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:90%
do about this?

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:84%
We need to get out ahead of this
before she gets to the White

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
House so we're seen as being
on the right side of the issue.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:84%
There was this rock
star who'd been

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
kind of buttonholing them for
years who had the same idea.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
The idea that he was presenting
to anyone he could talk to

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:84%
was, you know, you
guys are the good guys.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:84%
You're getting all these
attacks and criticisms

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.172 align:middle line:84%
as being bad and evil and
all the conspiracy stuff.

00:19:46.172 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And you really have been
defending the country.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
We need to get that
out to the public.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:84%
We need to get some
information to the public,

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
need to be part of that
so people can see you

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.513 align:middle line:90%
as the good guys that you are.

00:19:56.513 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're going, hmm, that's
kind of what we want to do.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a bad idea.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And by the way, if
we were to make a move on this,

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be tough if
we start a public group

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and one of our former CIA
guys is heading it up.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.280 align:middle line:90%
That's a little awkward.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
We need somebody who
will be the spokesperson,

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:84%
the lead person, who is
not a former CIA officer,

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have a
security clearance,

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:84%
but is well-liked and
is able to communicate

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:84%
to the young people,
and so forth.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think they decided
Tom works for us.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And they put this
together all through 2015.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Now in 2016, things
are heating up.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The articles are
getting more intense.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
She gave that interview
to Damon Steere

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
at the "Conway Daily Sun"
on December 30th of 2015.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Article's all over the world.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it's heating
up, it's heating up.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And so they're going, fine.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:90%
We're launching this thing.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But it was decided,
I think, that Tom

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.872 align:middle line:84%
would be the one to introduce
that something was coming.

00:20:55.872 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The front man?

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Teaser, right.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Letting them know he was
kind of the front guy.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so he goes on Knapp
and he does all this.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:84%
At that point, March
the 27th, there

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:84%
had been already 30 primaries,
Democratic primaries.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Hillary had won 20
and Bernie had won 10.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So she's still the
leading candidate.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's well on her way.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.715 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: All right.

00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:90%
So he announces this thing.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And my attitude still
was, I can't believe this.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:90%
This is so unusual.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But you know, history
comes in odd packages.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And as I've said
many times, we don't

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.447 align:middle line:84%
know exactly when disclosure
was going to happen,

00:21:31.447 --> 00:21:32.530 align:middle line:90%
the formal acknowledgment.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.900 align:middle line:84%
But we know it could be more
favorable or less favorable.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.767 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the final
process leading into it,

00:21:38.767 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
that was going to go.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea who was
going to be the players.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.783 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going
to get into that.

00:21:43.783 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you
about Robert Bigelow.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:10%
Robert Bigelow, billionaire,
bought the Skin Walker Ranch,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:10%
has floating pods in space
where he wants to build a hotel.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.723 align:middle line:90%
Is into the UFOs in a m big way.

00:21:58.723 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And he
comes into this.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was on "60
Minutes" talking about it.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Let's
talk about that, yes.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.357 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:04.357 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:10%
- Do you believe in aliens?

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:10%
- I'm absolutely convinced.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:10%
That's all there is to it.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:10%
- Do you also believe that
refers have come to Earth?

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:10%
- There has been and is an
existing presence, an ET

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:10%
presence.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.033 align:middle line:10%
And I've spent
millions and millions--

00:22:17.033 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:10%
I've probably spent more as
an individual than anybody

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:10%
else in the United States has
ever spent on this subject.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:10%
- Is it risky for you to
say in public that you

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:10%
believe in UFOs and aliens?

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.840 align:middle line:10%
- I don't care.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:10%
- You don't worry that
some people will say,

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:10%
did you hear that guy?

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.050 align:middle line:10%
Sounds like he's crazy.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:10%
- I don't care.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:10%
- Why not?

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:10%
- It's not going to
make a difference.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to change
reality of what I know.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:10%
- Do you imagine that
in our space travels,

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:10%
we will encounter other
forms of intelligent life?

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.730 align:middle line:10%
- You don't have to go anywhere.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:10%
- You can find it here.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:10%


00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.267 align:middle line:10%
- Where exactly?

00:23:02.267 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:10%
- It's just like right
under people's noses.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:10%
Oh, my gosh.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.394 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could tell she
was a little skeptical of all

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.262 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: That doesn't matter.

00:23:13.262 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:90%
This is a big deal, OK?

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I need to put this in
context for your audience.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
This is an historical
moment, without question.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.852 align:middle line:90%
This is a really big deal.

00:23:22.852 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:90%
And here's the context.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Knapp
interview takes place,

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and then we don't hear
anything for a number of months

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:84%
because I believe they intended
to launch the program that he

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:84%
was alluding to right
after Clinton's election,

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:84%
but before she makes
the White House,

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.748 align:middle line:84%
because if you're trying to get
out ahead of a disclosure event

00:23:46.748 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:84%
by the president,
you've got to do it

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:84%
before she gets to the White
House because she could do it.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: So it's all set.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything is ready to go.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, things
got a little strange.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Things changed.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes, indeed.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.537 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that
happened for them--

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
which wasn't a crisis,
but it was a problem--

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:84%
was the WikiLeaks dump of
all of Podesta's emails.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:84%
It shows that Tom DeLonge
has been interacting

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:90%
with Podesta for some time.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:90%
There's 45 emails in there.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Those weren't
supposed to be public.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it also showed
that DeLonge and that people

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:84%
did not approached
the Republicans.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.380 align:middle line:90%
They approached the Democrats.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Because Hillary's going to win.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they thought
she was going to win.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Absolutely.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.350 align:middle line:90%
So that was a problem.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But that was nothing compared
to what happened in the election

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:84%
because when she loses it,
the entire project that they

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.330 align:middle line:84%
were working on basically
is kind of blown up.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.545 align:middle line:90%
What do we do now?

00:24:36.545 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It crumbles?

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.003 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I'm not
saying it crumbles.

00:24:39.003 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But they just had to step
back and say now what?

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.103 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're in shock.

00:24:42.103 --> 00:24:43.972 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: First of
all, Tom had already

00:24:43.972 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:84%
sort of let the cat out of
the bag with his interview

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:84%
with George Knapp
in March of 2016.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Podesta
emails also indicated

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:90%
something was going on.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And now what do you do
because this was not the plan.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it took them 11 months
to make the decision as

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.033 align:middle line:90%
to whether to go ahead or not.

00:25:06.033 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think during
that 11 months,

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.330 align:middle line:84%
they were assessing
the new administration.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:90%
How was it going to go?

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it would get settled
down, it would be fine.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, it didn't do that.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty crazy.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And so what are
they going to do?

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately they
make the decision

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:84%
to launch on October the 11th,
2017 with a Facebook video

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.460 align:middle line:84%
presenting the
team to the public,

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and of course launching
the To the Stars Academy

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.750 align:middle line:84%
for Arts and Sciences, what
they called it, on the web,

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Very fine site.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the reasons
they made the decision

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.952 align:middle line:84%
to do it is that they've
always had the Putin problem.

00:25:45.952 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and they've always
known that Putin

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:90%
could disclose at any time.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.757 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
a huge problem.

00:25:50.757 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they wanted
to beat him to the punch.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well, if he
beats us to the punch, that

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:90%
is a big problem for the US.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And as it happened in
2017, I went to London.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I got a call from a Russian
national television network.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.530 align:middle line:90%
We want to interview you.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I go to
Moscow, I give them

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:84%
an hour and a interview, and
I'm talking Putin and disclosure

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:90%
and the whole nine yards.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.498 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
eating it up, aren't they?

00:26:12.498 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Well, I didn't know.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I went over-- this is a test.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking I may
never leave the country.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I may end up as a roommate
for Ed Snowden, who knows?

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never know.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:21.610 align:middle line:90%
They keep you.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: So I gave the
interview, I came back,

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and I waited.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was I
got the film eventually,

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:90%
which I didn't expect to get.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
They used some of the
clips on the show.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:10%
And then they ran two
articles in Pravda RU,

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:10%
which the Pentagon is totally on
top of, talking about how this

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:10%
UFO activist came to Russia
and wants Putin to disclose,

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:10%
which confirmed to me that--
this happened before October--

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:10%
that whatever is going
on, Vladimir Putin

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.020 align:middle line:10%
was not uncomfortable with
the idea of him being floated

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:10%
as a disclosure president.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Now the CIA knew all of this.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:90%
They knew I was in Moscow.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.640 align:middle line:84%
The Kremlin knew
I was in Moscow.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I had six meetings
while I was there.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They probably knew you
were going before you even did.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.268 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: They probably did.

00:27:02.268 --> 00:27:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And I met with six groups
of former Soviet and Russian

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:84%
people that had
dealt with the issue,

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
including a high
level politician.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:11.503 align:middle line:90%
This was all set up.

00:27:11.503 --> 00:27:13.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you feel
in danger at any point?

00:27:13.378 --> 00:27:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: No, no, no, no.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Everything was nice.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.050 align:middle line:90%
I had a translator.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.560 align:middle line:90%
It was like A get to know.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.620 align:middle line:90%
[RUSSIAN]

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Not much we could do.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:90%
We just had the meetings.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that Putin
would know I was there.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And so To the Stars,
people had a problem.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.310 align:middle line:84%
If they held out too
long and Putin moved--

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know for sure.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:84%
If this is not true, I welcome
that to be corrected by them .

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they
launch on October 11.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first move
in the end game of this chess

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:90%
game.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:50.355 align:middle line:90%
That's October 11.

00:27:50.355 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
the key moment.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
But first, this is something
that your audience has to know.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Only later do we learn how
tied into this Bob Bigelow was.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.142 align:middle line:90%
He knew about them.

00:28:02.142 --> 00:28:03.350 align:middle line:90%
He knew what they were doing.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.808 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We didn't know that
in the "60 Minutes" interview.

00:28:05.808 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: No, absolutely not.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:90%
He knew it, though.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: So when he
gets the test of his space

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:84%
habitat, the first test,
April, I think the 2nd

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.870 align:middle line:84%
or so, a month
later, it's logical

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to interview him.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.537 align:middle line:90%
It's a big deal.

00:28:19.537 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And he knew they were going to
ask him about his UFO interest.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:90%
It's been well-known for years.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.973 align:middle line:84%
And he could say
anything he wants.

00:28:25.973 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:84%
He could have said, you know,
I've always been interested.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:90%
I look into it's no big deal.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
He made a decision
that on that show,

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:84%
he was going to say
flat out that there

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.360 align:middle line:84%
is an extraterrestrial
presence here.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.010 align:middle line:84%
A man who has spent $400 million
to build technology for NASA

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:48.965 align:middle line:84%
under a 20-year contract
who he still has with NASA,

00:28:48.965 --> 00:28:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and apparently not
concerned that there

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.030 align:middle line:90%
was going to be any blowback.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Why did he do this?

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.020 align:middle line:90%
This is my sense of it.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Bob Bigelow was not
former inside CIA.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.837 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: He doesn't have
those kind of clearances.

00:29:02.837 --> 00:29:05.823 align:middle line:84%
He's not under
the same protocols

00:29:05.823 --> 00:29:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that the To the
Stars Academy team

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:84%
are under, which
we'll talk about.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And so when he
announces it in May,

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:84%
knowing there's going to be
a launch of To the Stars,

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.680 align:middle line:84%
he takes the pressure off
them because the To the Stars

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Academy can't do what he did,
and we'll talk about that.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:90%
But he can.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when he says there's
an extraterrestrial presence

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.140 align:middle line:84%
on "60 Minutes" in May of 2017,
the To the Stars Academy people

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:90%
don't have to.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.035 align:middle line:90%
Most anybody can figure it out.

00:29:33.035 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And then when it becomes known
that Bigelow was involved,

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.060 align:middle line:84%
he was part of the
research program

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, it makes
it even more clear.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And gives
it credibility.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.158 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Of course it does.

00:29:43.158 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And so this gives you a
sense of how complicated

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.800 align:middle line:90%
and organized this is.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the
announcement is made.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that announcement,
which was on Facebook,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Tom DeLonge opened it up.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
He introduced the idea, talked
about what was going on.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:84%
He had five of his
team members there.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
There were 10 team
members, initially,

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful group of
former insiders ever assembled.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since your
hearing in 2013.

00:30:11.045 --> 00:30:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yeah, even
bigger than that.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.445 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I felt my
citizen hearing on disclosure

00:30:15.445 --> 00:30:17.320 align:middle line:84%
was the most significant
event in the history

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.490 align:middle line:90%
of the disclosure movement.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so too.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: No longer.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.940 align:middle line:84%
No, no, To the Stars
Academy is the most one.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.332 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But at
the time, you were.

00:30:25.332 --> 00:30:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: For a while.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So give
yourself some credit.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: They're out in front.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the
political operative,

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:84%
the man on the team with
huge political connections

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.280 align:middle line:84%
in Washington working
on DIA committees--

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the intelligence
committees and so forth,

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Christopher Mellon.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And Christopher Mellon
gets up to talk.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And in that talk, he
makes a statement.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And this statement is the first
move in this end chess game.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.850 align:middle line:90%
And I think you have it.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.392 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
let's look at it.

00:30:56.392 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: , Listen and
listen very carefully,

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:90%
because this is a whopper.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.013 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing stuff.

00:31:02.013 --> 00:31:02.930 align:middle line:10%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.138 align:middle line:10%
- Permit me to tell you a
story in the hope of making

00:31:05.138 --> 00:31:06.770 align:middle line:10%
this clearer.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:10%
We are presently standing
within 10 miles of the home

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:14.240 align:middle line:10%
port of the USS Nimitz,
a $5 billion warship

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:10%
with a crew of thousands.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:10%
It is one of the premier
assets in the US Navy.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.940 align:middle line:10%
Envision the Nimitz operating
off the coast of San Diego

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:10%
on a brilliant
sunny day, escorted

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.520 align:middle line:10%
by the USS Princeton, an
Aegis class cruiser that

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.920 align:middle line:10%
protects carrier battle
groups by employing

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.830 align:middle line:10%
the most sophisticated Naval
air defense system in the world.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.300 align:middle line:10%
Imagine these ships engaging
in a routine training exercise

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:10%
when an unidentified
aircraft with a small radar

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:44.300 align:middle line:10%
cross-section appears on the
Princeton's radar heading

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.820 align:middle line:10%
directly towards
the battle group.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:10%
The aircraft has no
transponder, does not

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.440 align:middle line:10%
respond to radio calls.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:10%
The Princeton hurriedly
contacts two F18s already aloft

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.630 align:middle line:10%
to intercept the target.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:10%
As the two F18s approach,
the four aviators

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.700 align:middle line:10%
see that the object has
no wings or exhaust.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.940 align:middle line:10%
It is white, oblong,
some 40 feet long,

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.370 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps 12 feet thick.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:10%
One pilot pursues the craft
while his wing man stays high.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.240 align:middle line:10%
The pilots are astonished
to see the object suddenly

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.200 align:middle line:10%
reorient itself toward
the approaching F18.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.750 align:middle line:10%
In a series of discrete
tumbling maneuvers that

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:23.270 align:middle line:10%
seem to defy the
laws of physics,

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.580 align:middle line:10%
the object takes a
position directly

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:10%
behind the approaching F18.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:31.040 align:middle line:10%
The pilots capture
gun camera footage

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:10%
in infrared imagery
of the object,

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.070 align:middle line:10%
but are outmatched by a
technology they've never seen.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:10%
Fearful for their safety
and running low on fuel,

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.780 align:middle line:10%
both F18s return to the Nimitz.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.690 align:middle line:10%
Yet the strange object remains
in the vicinity of the Nimitz

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:48.800 align:middle line:10%
for hours, monitored by
the USS Princeton and radar

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:10%
aboard a Navy E2
Hawkeye aircraft.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.690 align:middle line:10%
At one point the object
soars to 80,000 feet,

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:02.180 align:middle line:10%
hovers, then drops at supersonic
speeds, coming to a full stop

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.840 align:middle line:10%
a mere 50 feet above the ocean,
where it resumes hovering.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.500 align:middle line:10%
More F18s are dispatched,
but with similar results.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:10%
As before, the engagement
occurs in broad daylight,

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:17.840 align:middle line:10%
and the secret machine
easily evades the F18s.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.450 align:middle line:10%
Dozens of military personnel
aboard the various planes

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.690 align:middle line:10%
and ships involved are
privy to these interactions.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:10%
Bear in mind that Naval aviators
are the finest observers

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.440 align:middle line:10%
possible.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.150 align:middle line:10%
All have top secret clearances.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:10%
All are drug tested,
are ardent patriots,

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:10%
have excellent
vision, and understand

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.350 align:middle line:10%
aeronautics and aviation.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:40.490 align:middle line:10%
Clearly this is not an
experimental US aircraft.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.990 align:middle line:10%
But whose is it?

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.110 align:middle line:10%
How did it accomplish
these feats?

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:10%
This story may sound
like a sci-fi movie,

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.610 align:middle line:10%
but it is a true story.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Whose is it?

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:90%
What has just happened here?

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: A highly
respected man

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.910 align:middle line:84%
with extensive experience
on Capitol Hill

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:84%
with the intel
committees and so forth.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And explain who
Mellon is again for us.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Christopher Mellon.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:09.440 align:middle line:84%
He has been involved in
the intelligence work,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
particularly from the
political point of view.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.040 align:middle line:84%
He is their political
guy on the team.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.560 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And so if you read
his background,

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.139 align:middle line:90%
it's very significant.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So he's connected to people
all over Washington, DC.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.699 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And respected.

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:24.032 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: And highly respected.

00:34:24.032 --> 00:34:28.159 align:middle line:84%
He just described not just any
event, but the Nimitz event,

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:30.590 align:middle line:84%
which is a very significant
event, which we knew about,

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:84%
but he just basically
confirmed it completely.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.042 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Confirmed it, exactly.

00:34:34.042 --> 00:34:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And if
you listen to it, OK,

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:84%
anybody who knows a
little bit of physics

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.880 align:middle line:84%
knows that we don't have
anything that can do that.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Russia doesn't.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.520 align:middle line:90%
China doesn't.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Brazil doesn't.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:84%
If a 737 did what that craft did
when it stopped over the ocean,

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.889 align:middle line:84%
everybody in that craft
would basically be a puddle.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it
seems like the fighter

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.963 align:middle line:84%
jets were approaching it, and
it flipped over behind them.

00:35:00.963 --> 00:35:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Oh, it did
that, it did this.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But he's talking
about some later stuff

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that happened because they
tracked this for two weeks.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things it did--
not in the video that they put

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.660 align:middle line:90%
out--

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, it
wasn't just one.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.860 align:middle line:90%
There was a fleet of them.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And so he describes this, and
when he finished, I'm going,

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.600 align:middle line:90%
hello.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Now you notice he doesn't say
that it's extraterrestrial.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never did.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: And they never do.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But Bob Bigelow had
already said it.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.520 align:middle line:90%
And so this is the opening move.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.740 align:middle line:84%
When Mellon makes that
statement, from that point on,

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I almost knew instinctively
where this was going.

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
that was sanctioned?

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.138 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Oh, it's
all sanctioned.

00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
important for those

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that are criticizing this
project, and I understand that.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.000 align:middle line:90%
People are frustrated and angry.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:90%
They've been lied to for years.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.020 align:middle line:90%
They don't trust the government.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people are
very skeptical about all

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.090 align:middle line:84%
these insiders with
these clearances

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and work with the CIA, and
they're criticizing it.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.470 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:90%
But what can I say?

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you my perspective
in that in order for them

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:84%
to do what they did, to have
this 10 people come together

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:12.133 align:middle line:84%
with these extraordinary
backgrounds in a public way,

00:36:12.133 --> 00:36:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to say that they're going
to bring information

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:17.890 align:middle line:84%
to the public, they're going to
be studying aspects of this--

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.870 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able
to do that, they

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:22.330 align:middle line:84%
had to stay within
certain guidelines.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:24.065 align:middle line:84%
They have support
inside the Pentagon.

00:36:24.065 --> 00:36:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But there's plenty of people
in the military intelligence

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:84%
complex that would rather
they just didn't exist.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And so what were these rules?

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:84%
One, you will not break your
nondisclosure agreements,

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.960 align:middle line:90%
which they haven't.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.200 align:middle line:84%
You will not release any
classified information, only

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:90%
stuff that we declassify.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to
talk about extraterrestrials

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:43.780 align:middle line:90%
and aliens.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Also, you need to stay away
from the ET community, right?

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.270 align:middle line:84%
For several reasons,
not the least

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:84%
of which there are a lot of us
know all the right questions

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:55.940 align:middle line:90%
to ask.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.357 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why didn't they just
come out full boat, Stephen?

00:36:58.357 --> 00:36:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Why these little dribbles?

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Because of the
political environment.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.850 align:middle line:90%
That is their problem.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
wanted to launch.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to wait until the
political situation in America

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.450 align:middle line:84%
right now, which
is unprecedented,

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.500 align:middle line:84%
resolves because to make
this effort in the middle

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:84%
of this political geostorm,
it just gets subsumed,

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.170 align:middle line:90%
as we'll find out in a second.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.497 align:middle line:90%
And so this is their calculus.

00:37:23.497 --> 00:37:24.830 align:middle line:90%
So they had to follow the rules.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they've limited
their interaction

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.020 align:middle line:90%
with people in the community.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.720 align:middle line:84%
They've been very
careful so they

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.120 align:middle line:84%
can continue to have the
support inside, which

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.500 align:middle line:90%
includes not saying--

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.800 align:middle line:90%
he could have said, look--

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:84%
he could have easily said,
there's nothing on Earth

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.390 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.740 align:middle line:84%
This is almost certainly
from somewhere else.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:90%
But they don't do that.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And so now things
start to unfold.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the next move is
huge, as you know about.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, remember, all of
this is planned in advance.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.610 align:middle line:90%
They're not winging this.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And so over the next
two months, they

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.560 align:middle line:84%
give a number of interviews
to "The New York Times".

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I think those interviews were
facilitated by Leslie Kane.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
was unprecedented.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Unprecedented.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Leslie Kane, who's been a
tremendous asset to this field

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:90%
as a journalist.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.340 align:middle line:84%
They give extensive interviews,
which "The New York Times" vets

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.030 align:middle line:84%
thoroughly, and become
quite convinced this is real

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and this is news, and
do two stories published

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.570 align:middle line:84%
on the same day, front
page, under the fold.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.520 align:middle line:90%
But these are big stories.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Helene Cooper, Pulitzer
Prizewinner, is the lead.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Leslie Kane is
also on the story.

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And then just for
extra cloud, they

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:84%
bring in Ralph Blumenthal,
who's won two Pulitzer Prizes,

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.210 align:middle line:90%
and they publish these stories.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what did
we learn in those stories?

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We learned that there was a
program called the Advanced

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Aerospace Threat
Identifications program.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which we didn't
know about before.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: We didn't
know about it.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know about it--

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that had run from 2007 to
2012 officially, and then

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.090 align:middle line:90%
less officially after that.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:57.102 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Financed
with $20 billion.

00:38:57.102 --> 00:38:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: $22 million.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:10%
We learned that
Harry Reid, the--

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.582 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Senator from Nevada.

00:39:03.582 --> 00:39:05.290 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: The majority
leader is the one

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.555 align:middle line:10%
that got the program going.

00:39:07.555 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And if it wasn't for
Harry Reid, the Pentagon

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.347 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have done it.

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:12.970 align:middle line:84%
They wanted nothing to do
with it, absolutely not.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must
have been going nuts.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.877 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Because they've
been studying extraterrestrials

00:39:15.877 --> 00:39:17.620 align:middle line:90%
and black programs for 70 years.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't need another program
that's near the surface,

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:20.950 align:middle line:90%
but it's Harry Reid.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.992 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Especially one
that could become public.

00:39:22.992 --> 00:39:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Absolutely.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Because it was never a use app.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.000 align:middle line:90%
It was basically just quiet.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we learned that
Bob Bigelow, of course,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.128 align:middle line:84%
was the one that persuaded
Reid to go do this.

00:39:34.128 --> 00:39:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And we learned that Bob Bigelow
was part of the research that

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.670 align:middle line:84%
was going on during
that program,

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and that he was focusing
on the materiel research.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:90%
They set up a lab at aerospace.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.340 align:middle line:90%
We're learning all of this.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we also learned that
Lewis Elizondo got permission

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to, when he retired
from the CIA--

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:90%
or the DOD, rather--

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to bring some gun
camera footage with him.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who made
Elizondo to go public?

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Who forced that?

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I don't think
anybody forced him.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
he did it on his own?

00:40:05.417 --> 00:40:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: No, this
group was put together

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.750 align:middle line:84%
from the inside over a
period of many months.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And Tom DeLonge
got hooked to it.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is a carefully
planned effort

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.160 align:middle line:84%
on the part of a
lot of people inside

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.380 align:middle line:84%
the military
intelligence complex who

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:84%
feel it's time for them to
become part of the solution.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And they've created
this organization

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:32.950 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
way to approach it.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Tom is the multimedia guy
with the books and so forth.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Elizondo is the
spokesperson for the team.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:90%
They're being very careful.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.020 align:middle line:90%
But one thing is very clear.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.880 align:middle line:84%
The To the Stars Academy
of Arts and Sciences

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is now the point of the spear
of the disclosure movement.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:53.467 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm an activist.

00:40:53.467 --> 00:40:54.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not dealing with them.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.350 align:middle line:84%
They're not dealing with
me because I don't have

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:57.400 align:middle line:90%
the restrictions they have.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
not part of that.

00:40:58.775 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I can
say anything I want.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.330 align:middle line:90%
They have to be careful.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not them.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that background.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And so this was a
carefully done maneuver,

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and "The New York Times"
stories were carefully planned.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.490 align:middle line:90%
And those stories come out.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the gun camera
footage, the most important,

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.570 align:middle line:90%
was the Nimitz footage.

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:21.640 align:middle line:84%
But understand there had
never been a authorized--

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a leak
once, back in 2004--

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:29.600 align:middle line:84%
release of gun camera footage
by any nation anywhere.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are thousands of
these films in our files

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:37.275 align:middle line:84%
and the UK and any other nation
with an advanced Air Force

00:41:37.275 --> 00:41:38.650 align:middle line:84%
because they've
been intercepting

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:39.663 align:middle line:90%
these bogies for years.

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And when they go up to see
what the hell's going on,

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.260 align:middle line:90%
they film everything.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.530 align:middle line:90%
And they can't be released.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And every effort
to get those films

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.110 align:middle line:84%
have failed because
if you were to put--

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.235 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: National security.

00:41:49.235 --> 00:41:50.902 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yeah, if
put out those films,

00:41:50.902 --> 00:41:52.340 align:middle line:90%
the truth embargo would blow up.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess where they turn up?

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:56.065 align:middle line:84%
They turn up through
the To the Stars Academy

00:41:56.065 --> 00:41:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and they're handed over
"The New York Times".

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.320 align:middle line:84%
The Nimitz film
and the other two

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:84%
go up on the web, seen
by millions of people

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.760 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.820 align:middle line:90%
This is really big now.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Even though the announcement
of the To the Stars Academy got

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.100 align:middle line:84%
a decent amount of press-- it's
all archived on my website--

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.630 align:middle line:90%
the two "New York Times"--

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did a lot
on "Coast to Coast".

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Talked about it.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And "The New York Times"
articles got even more press

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.270 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:29.990 align:middle line:84%
The geopolitical storm underway
basically just pushed it away.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
we're back to the other thing.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.530 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think their
decision was, look,

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:84%
we can't keep making these
important historic efforts

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and have it all disappear
into a political storm.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:44.860 align:middle line:90%
We're going to stand back.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did
is they stood back.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.647 align:middle line:84%
Tom DeLonge basically went
back into his music stuff.

00:42:49.647 --> 00:42:50.980 align:middle line:90%
He's been working with the band.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.310 align:middle line:90%
He's getting a new album.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:54.310 align:middle line:90%
And you don't hear much.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They haven't
disbanded now.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: No.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.960 align:middle line:84%
No, no, they haven't disbanded,
but they've gone quiet.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.590 align:middle line:84%
They're working
behind the scenes.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Now some of this is rumor.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty
sure that one, Tom

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.250 align:middle line:84%
has been meeting with high
level people in Hollywood

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.910 align:middle line:84%
about films about a lot of great
projects behind the scenes.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:15.280 align:middle line:84%
We think they've had
some meetings on the Hill

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.470 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes
with some top people,

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.910 align:middle line:90%
maybe some heads of committees.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Also, I think Amy
Basara is somebody

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.890 align:middle line:84%
that's spoken out on this,
but again, all private.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:84%
We know that on
February the 2nd,

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.480 align:middle line:84%
because Steven Aftergood
of the Federation

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.761 align:middle line:84%
of American Scientists
put in an FOIA

00:43:30.761 --> 00:43:36.640 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of files outlining
all of the reports

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that the AATIP
program had gotten.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I think Hal Puthoff is the
one who put that request.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And that got delivered to the
Armed Service Committee chair.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Again, pretty low key.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And so things are going on, but
it's not in the public arena.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:84%
We know they have more gun
camera footage and Lord knows

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:90%
what else.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
ready to drop it yet.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:00.320 align:middle line:90%
My belief is--

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Timing.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: That they are waiting
for the political storm to end.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're
waiting on resolution

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.690 align:middle line:84%
of this rather unusual
circumstance that we're in.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.677 align:middle line:84%
I believe that resolution
could come pretty soon,

00:44:13.677 --> 00:44:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's a subject
for another show.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You want to bring me,
I'll come on "Coast",

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk for five
hours about it.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to
ask a question, right?

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just let
you do the talking.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Just bring me on
and go get a ham sandwich.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: But if the political
situation settles down

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to a point where if things
are in a comfortable position,

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:32.830 align:middle line:84%
the To the Stars
Academy is going

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:34.705 align:middle line:90%
to start making immediate moves.

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:36.580 align:middle line:84%
They're going to start
bringing out material.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.350 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
more announcements.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And the end game
of this chess match

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:47.110 align:middle line:84%
is going to move aggressively
forward, meaning--

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.780 align:middle line:90%
and again, I'm not a prophet.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply saying that depending
upon the political situation

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and how it develops
over the next 60 days,

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:59.380 align:middle line:84%
the potential for this breaking
out wide open this year,

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.770 align:middle line:84%
before the end of 2019,
is very, very good.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking
people and suggesting

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:05.470 align:middle line:90%
people pay close attention.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Nimitz story
is one of the biggest

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:09.042 align:middle line:90%
stories we've had.

00:45:09.042 --> 00:45:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It's as
good as it gets.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a long time.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.140 align:middle line:90%
It's as good as it gets.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And yet you're
absolutely right.

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:15.760 align:middle line:90%
It's died.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well, remember,
all those 400 articles

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:21.670 align:middle line:84%
that I helped generate
during the campaign.

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:23.530 align:middle line:90%
They're still up on the web.

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And the articles about the
TTSA launch is up on the web.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And "The New York Times"
articles, that not going away.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.440 align:middle line:84%
They're all ready to jump
back in when the time is right

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.120 align:middle line:90%
and when the story is there.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind
of spring loaded.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But there's one wild
card here that I

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.250 align:middle line:84%
love to keep mentioning,
George, because I

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.010 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure the Pentagon
and the White House hear me.

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And that is this.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.940 align:middle line:90%
It's the Rosie Ruiz effect.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Good old Vladimir.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who does that affect?

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Rosie Ruiz-- and
I'm not picking on her--

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is a very resourceful woman who
long ago, at a Boston Marathon,

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.700 align:middle line:84%
got the idea, I'll
start the race,

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I'll take a cab to
the finish, I'll

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.190 align:middle line:84%
wait till it's on it's
about 1,000 yards.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll jump in and I'll
win the women's race.

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And she actually got the trophy.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Vladimir Putin doesn't have
to even start the race.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.110 align:middle line:84%
He can just sit there
and watch and watch.

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And when things seem
getting closer and closer,

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like, oh,
wow, looks like disclosure

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:25.030 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen, he jumps
in just before the end,

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.927 align:middle line:90%
takes the trophy.

00:46:25.927 --> 00:46:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Takes the trophy.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And so
that's the problem.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he would
take the trophy.

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.973 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well, you
know, it's interesting.

00:46:30.973 --> 00:46:33.497 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is talking about
how he's driving us crazy

00:46:33.497 --> 00:46:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and making things-- you know,
messing us up in every way

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:37.150 align:middle line:90%
he can.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:42.040 align:middle line:84%
If Vladimir Putin were to
take that legacy away from us,

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.815 align:middle line:90%
wow, that would be a disruption.

00:46:43.815 --> 00:46:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you had
mentioned former Senator Harry

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Reid and his project.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Our own George Knapp once again
got a chance to interview him.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: He's interviewed
him several times.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here he is.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Let's
look at that, yes.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.760 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.730 align:middle line:10%
- Harry Reid's interest in
UFOs dates back 30 years,

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.910 align:middle line:10%
but he kept it quiet
until December 2017,

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:02.650 align:middle line:10%
when "The New York
Times" reported

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:06.190 align:middle line:10%
about AATIP, a secret
Pentagon study of UFOs

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:10.210 align:middle line:10%
and related phenomena initiated
by Reid and two other senators.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:14.290 align:middle line:10%
Documents related to AATIP and
its offshoot, ALSOP, do not

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:17.620 align:middle line:10%
mention UFOs, ETs,
or little green men,

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.960 align:middle line:10%
and Reid has been careful
to avoid the tabloid slant.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.900 align:middle line:10%
- You've used that
quote about you're

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:24.640 align:middle line:10%
not sure that there
are little green men.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.240 align:middle line:10%
You don't necessarily
believe in that.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.040 align:middle line:10%
We don't know.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.840 align:middle line:10%
Fact is, we don't know
what it is, right,

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.757 align:middle line:10%
or where they're from.

00:47:29.757 --> 00:47:31.600 align:middle line:10%
- We do not know--

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:37.150 align:middle line:10%
what I have learned is you
cannot just hide your head

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:40.150 align:middle line:10%
and say these things
aren't happening.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.970 align:middle line:10%
We have military
installations where

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:49.300 align:middle line:10%
hundreds and hundreds of people
who are there see these things.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.750 align:middle line:10%
- Dramatic military episodes
involving highly advanced

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:57.040 align:middle line:10%
but unknown intruders, such as a
fleet of so-called gimbal craft

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.870 align:middle line:10%
in 2015, or the 2004
incursions by large tic-tacs,

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:05.170 align:middle line:10%
more than justify an
ongoing study, Reid says.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.950 align:middle line:10%
- And as I said, it's a
worldwide phenomenon, not just

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.040 align:middle line:10%
here in the United States.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.540 align:middle line:10%
There are certain places we
really don't understand why

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.140 align:middle line:10%
that there's more
occurrences, and they have

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.620 align:middle line:10%
been over a long, long time.

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.527 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:48:20.527 --> 00:48:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know they
know what's going on.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Oh, god,
of course they do.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But ending this truth
embargo is no trivial matter.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:32.050 align:middle line:84%
It is difficult. And in order
to maintain enough support

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.690 align:middle line:84%
inside the military
intelligence complex,

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.180 align:middle line:84%
they need to stay within
certain boundaries.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.100 align:middle line:90%
But let me be clear.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.483 align:middle line:84%
When Robert Bigelow
said to that woman

00:48:42.483 --> 00:48:43.900 align:middle line:84%
when she said, do
you think people

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.460 align:middle line:84%
are going to think you're
crazy, and he said,

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't give a damn.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He doesn't care.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: That was the
second most important

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:51.000 align:middle line:10%
I don't give a damn
in American history.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.870 align:middle line:84%
You know what the
first one was, right?

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scarlett.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Brett.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.470 align:middle line:90%
He became my hero.

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:59.710 align:middle line:84%
He always was my hero, but
at that point, my hero.

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And then Harry Reid.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Harry Reid-- I think
he was a pilot--

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:05.470 align:middle line:90%
he has quite a background.

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.550 align:middle line:90%
He's quite a remarkable guy.

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And he got that program because
he was the House Majority

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Leader.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise the Pentagon
would have blown it.

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, of course.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: But then when he
gets out of that position,

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:16.970 align:middle line:90%
they close it down.

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bigelow had
a lot to do with it.

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:20.088 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And Bigelow
had a lot to do with it.

00:49:20.088 --> 00:49:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And then Harry is
out of government.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But he gets connected back to
the issue when "The New York

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Times" articles are done.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.050 align:middle line:90%
By this time he's ill.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:31.930 align:middle line:84%
We know he's dying
of pancreatic cancer.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But he gives more interviews,
and he sticks by his guns.

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying--
you know, he's doing

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:40.725 align:middle line:84%
what he can in his last
days to help this happen.

00:49:40.725 --> 00:49:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
kind of people--

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without
spilling the beans.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.465 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Without
spilling the beings.

00:49:45.465 --> 00:49:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But still, this is
the kind of courage,

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:50.920 align:middle line:84%
these are the kind of
people that are my people.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.530 align:middle line:90%
As a political activist--

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you amazed,
after all these years

00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:00.850 align:middle line:84%
that you've been doing
this, now it's popping?

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.230 align:middle line:90%
You wanted this 20 years ago.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I needed this
10 years ago, George.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any other jobs, OK?

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.523 align:middle line:84%
If disclosure doesn't
come soon, I'm

00:50:09.523 --> 00:50:11.440 align:middle line:84%
going to be out on one
of those street corners

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.020 align:middle line:90%
with a cardboard sign.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'll drop a
20, whatever, in your basket.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: So that sum total of
all this is that if things go

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:25.360 align:middle line:84%
the way they are, this period,
this rather odd period where

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.460 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon, the military
intelligence complex,

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:31.480 align:middle line:84%
steps into it, that a rock star
named Tom DeLonge is a major

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:38.260 align:middle line:84%
player, that Reid and Bigelow
and all of this happening as we

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.330 align:middle line:90%
move forward--

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:44.110 align:middle line:84%
when you look at it
from 30,000 feet,

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:46.000 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the
biggest historical events,

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.888 align:middle line:84%
maybe the most historical
event, in American history.

00:50:48.888 --> 00:50:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow it
all, you might see it.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.222 align:middle line:84%
But if you just know
bits and pieces,

00:50:52.222 --> 00:50:54.160 align:middle line:84%
you don't realize
it's happening.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And this may very well
in the truth embargo,

00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.390 align:middle line:84%
either by whoever the hell
is president in a while,

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:02.890 align:middle line:90%
or by Vladimir Putin.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I hope it's our
president because I'm

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.300 align:middle line:84%
an American citizen,
and I understand

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.910 align:middle line:84%
how important it is for the
United States to be first.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.890 align:middle line:90%
But long term it doesn't matter.

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's our president or
Putin or Xi Jinping, whoever

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:17.710 align:middle line:84%
is the first announcement,
it will spread worldwide

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and we will finally be in
the post-disclosure world.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But aren't
we scrambling if Putin

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:24.910 align:middle line:90%
comes out and says it first?

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Oh, we're
going to have to scramble.

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.050 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be awful.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.360 align:middle line:84%
He's getting all the glory,
the great truth teller.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And then 500 reporters will
descend on the Pentagon going--

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why didn't you tell us?

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:37.670 align:middle line:90%
You knew.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.462 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yeah, and
the Pentagon is going,

00:51:39.462 --> 00:51:40.990 align:middle line:90%
well, we wanted to.

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:42.400 align:middle line:90%
No, this is not good.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.360 align:middle line:90%
And I agree.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.927 align:middle line:84%
Look, I totally agree
with Tom DeLonge.

00:51:46.927 --> 00:51:48.010 align:middle line:90%
And I've always said this.

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.605 align:middle line:90%
You know I've said this.

00:51:49.605 --> 00:51:50.980 align:middle line:84%
The military
intelligence complex

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.270 align:middle line:84%
is not filled with a bunch
of demons or anything.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:55.850 align:middle line:84%
These are good people, paid
not particularly great.

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:56.650 align:middle line:90%
They're not rich.

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:57.940 align:middle line:90%
They're defending the country.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And the truth embargo
and the ET issue

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.630 align:middle line:84%
was necessary
during the Cold War.

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:03.732 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
they didn't want it out.

00:52:03.732 --> 00:52:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a bit of a problem
because it's been 20 some years

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:07.870 align:middle line:90%
since the end of the Cold War.

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.045 align:middle line:90%
But they're not the enemy.

00:52:10.045 --> 00:52:11.920 align:middle line:84%
There's abuse of power
in the black projects.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's abuse of
power in a lot of ways.

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:15.830 align:middle line:90%
But these are not the enemy.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the fact that
they can get out

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.170 align:middle line:84%
in front of this a
little bit and we

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:24.520 align:middle line:84%
can start to understand the
kind of people they are.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Elizondo is fantastic.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:26.947 align:middle line:90%
I love this guy.

00:52:26.947 --> 00:52:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's a guy you
can sit down and have

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.180 align:middle line:90%
a beer with in a biker bar.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.020 align:middle line:90%
But the guy is genius.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.970 align:middle line:90%
So this is all good.

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But I understand that the
frustration and suspicion

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and paranoia regarding the
government, particularly

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.670 align:middle line:84%
in the ET community,
is very high.

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it because of that
age-old Brookings report which

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.360 align:middle line:84%
basically studied
what would happen

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.660 align:middle line:84%
if we disclosed to the
public the presence

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.310 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials?

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And they concluded the
public can't handle it.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Age old is
the key phrase here.

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:00.880 align:middle line:90%
That was the '60s.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we ain't there anymore.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.003 align:middle line:90%
The people are ready.

00:53:05.003 --> 00:53:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Many in the government
know we're ready.

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think people are
ready to hear that humans are

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:14.560 align:middle line:84%
being abducted, taken
off this planet,

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.800 align:middle line:84%
for God knows what purpose,
maybe not brought back?

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yeah.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.260 align:middle line:90%
You want to know why?

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Because that's not the first
thing they're going to hear.

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:24.248 align:middle line:84%
First they're going to hear
there's an ET presence and then

00:53:24.248 --> 00:53:25.600 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of other cool stuff.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the
contactee stuff will

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.800 align:middle line:84%
start to work its way into
the post-disclosure dialogue.

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But as it happens, perhaps
2% of the population--

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.620 align:middle line:90%
which is a huge number--

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
a great number.

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:36.858 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: It's a big number.

00:53:36.858 --> 00:53:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But 2% the population may
be having direct contact,

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.990 align:middle line:90%
not all of it necessarily bad.

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But what's the
flip side of that?

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.170 align:middle line:90%
98% are not.

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:47.997 align:middle line:84%
And so the other 98%
are going to be telling,

00:53:47.997 --> 00:53:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to know everything
about extraterrestrials.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I really feel bad about
your experience, contactee.

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that is somehow
going to be this huge problem,

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:57.617 align:middle line:90%
no, it's not.

00:53:57.617 --> 00:53:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't predict
what's going to happen

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.970 align:middle line:90%
the post-disclosure world.

00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:04.987 align:middle line:84%
My estimate, based on 22
years of thinking about this,

00:54:04.987 --> 00:54:06.820 align:middle line:84%
is it's not going be
too bad and we're going

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.945 align:middle line:90%
to be pretty cool about it.

00:54:07.945 --> 00:54:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you excited
about where we are right now?

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: All I
can say is, yeah.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.400 align:middle line:84%
The To the Stars
Academy, in my mind--

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:20.200 align:middle line:84%
unless the military intelligence
complex turns on them and pulls

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.865 align:middle line:84%
them back in and says no
more, which could happen--

00:54:22.865 --> 00:54:23.740 align:middle line:90%
but I don't think so.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would they
cut the door like that?

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Because
there are people still

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.840 align:middle line:84%
inside that do not want these
guys out there doing this,

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.860 align:middle line:90%
I assure you.

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.170 align:middle line:84%
They somehow have gotten
the ability to do it.

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:34.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how the
authorization came.

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:37.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
how this support exists.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.140 align:middle line:90%
They haven't told us.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.760 align:middle line:90%
But clearly it does.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't
been pulled in yet.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Bigelow, has he had a problem
with NASA because he just

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.210 align:middle line:90%
announced there's ETs here?

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:46.502 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:54:46.502 --> 00:54:47.800 align:middle line:90%
He's still doing this thing.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Has the Pentagon
put out long missives

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:50.050 align:middle line:90%
attacking these guys?

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:50.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:52.060 align:middle line:90%
So I feel optimistic.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But still, it just so
happens that we're also

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.510 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of probably
the biggest political crisis

00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:59.740 align:middle line:90%
in American history.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens, OK?

00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, history is what
it is, and it's kind of

00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:05.800 align:middle line:90%
complicated this.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But if things tend to
move in a direction

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:10.120 align:middle line:84%
where they can get
back into play,

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.310 align:middle line:90%
disclosure could be at hand.

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:13.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'm excited about that.

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.530 align:middle line:90%
God, I'm beyond excited.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:17.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well,
what's amazing for me

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:20.680 align:middle line:10%
as a reporter and
a broadcaster who

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.690 align:middle line:10%
has been on the outside
looking in for all

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:25.060 align:middle line:10%
these years, Stephen,
is that people

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:30.560 align:middle line:10%
like you will be vindicated
after all these years.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.080 align:middle line:90%
You've been in the trenches.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.360 align:middle line:90%
You've been congratulated.

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.850 align:middle line:90%
You've been villicated.

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:39.040 align:middle line:90%
You've been smacked out.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.200 align:middle line:84%
You've been right in the
middle of all this stuff.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And finally, you
will be vindicated,

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:44.955 align:middle line:90%
along with others like you.

00:55:44.955 --> 00:55:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Let me
tell you, there

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.240 align:middle line:84%
are many more people
in this field that

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.270 align:middle line:84%
have put in many more years
that will also be vindicated.

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And something like that
is going on right now.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I've spent a lot of
time with Paul Hynek.

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:57.930 align:middle line:10%
He is a fantastic
guy, and he's getting

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.090 align:middle line:10%
into lots of conferences.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:03.690 align:middle line:10%
He is one of Hynek's, I
think, six children, five

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:06.750 align:middle line:10%
or six children, who has really
paid a little more attention,

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:08.430 align:middle line:10%
and he's now stepped
into this field.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:09.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's the
son of J. Allen.

00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:11.310 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Son of
J. Allen Hynek.

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:14.080 align:middle line:10%
And one of the reasons he
did is because history--

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.620 align:middle line:10%
which is Prometheus and
history and all this,

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.970 align:middle line:10%
they know what's going on.

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:20.850 align:middle line:10%
They decided, let's do a
full series on J. Allen Hynek

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:22.890 align:middle line:10%
So they create this
theatrical series

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:25.140 align:middle line:10%
where they take actual cases.

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Project Blue Book.

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:28.203 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: They embellish
them and make them

00:56:28.203 --> 00:56:29.250 align:middle line:10%
a theatrical story.

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But they always provide
the case behind the story.

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:36.450 align:middle line:90%
They've just done nine episodes.

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Five million viewers.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Already.

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It's one of the
top rated shows in cable.

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.330 align:middle line:84%
The second series has always
already been approved,

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and the Hynek family is
very comfortable with this.

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Paul is going to be working
even closer with them.

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:52.950 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:56.760 align:middle line:84%
J. Allen Hynek is now becoming
known to millions of people.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.480 align:middle line:84%
His vindication is
underway right now.

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And let me
explain to our audience

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:03.840 align:middle line:10%
who J. Allen Hynek was.

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:07.050 align:middle line:10%
He was a consultant to
Project Blue Book, which

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:09.420 align:middle line:10%
the military, through
the Air Force,

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:12.750 align:middle line:10%
used to study
extraterrestrial stories.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:15.510 align:middle line:90%
He was a skeptic for years.

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:19.470 align:middle line:84%
He was the guy who held a
news conference in Michigan

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.615 align:middle line:90%
and said, this is swamp gas.

00:57:21.615 --> 00:57:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Swamp gas.

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:23.150 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole story there.

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it haunted
him all his career.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:30.780 align:middle line:84%
When he retired, he formed
an organization to study UFOs

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.780 align:middle line:90%
and he became a believer.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: He was
he was a professor

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:36.790 align:middle line:84%
at a school near White Patterson
is where Blue Book started.

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:37.957 align:middle line:90%
That's why they grabbed him.

00:57:37.957 --> 00:57:39.030 align:middle line:90%
But he was a top guy.

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:41.370 align:middle line:84%
He comes in, yeah, he's
going to debunk it.

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Over time, though,
he starts to switch.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.675 align:middle line:84%
He had already switched
before he left, but--

00:57:45.675 --> 00:57:47.258 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
let him know that.

00:57:47.258 --> 00:57:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: But he just
didn't speak publicly.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And so finally he leaves,
and then he forms CUFOS

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:56.843 align:middle line:84%
and he becomes, along
with James McDonnell,

00:57:56.843 --> 00:57:58.260 align:middle line:84%
two of the top
scientists that are

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:01.140 align:middle line:84%
out there in the early
days, pushing this issue.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:04.170 align:middle line:84%
He also had five children
with Mamie, a wonderful woman.

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:05.590 align:middle line:90%
He had a fantastic life.

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:08.788 align:middle line:84%
But he did not live long enough
to see the disclosure event.

00:58:08.788 --> 00:58:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He'd be proud of
what's happening today.

00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: But his family will.

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And he's being vindicated.

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot more
vindication to come.

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
important is this.

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.840 align:middle line:90%
The issue will be vindicated.

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.470 align:middle line:84%
The contactees
will be vindicated.

00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And I am hoping that in
a post-disclosure world,

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.492 align:middle line:84%
the people that have invested
their lives in this--

00:58:32.492 --> 00:58:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Including you.

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yeah, including me--

00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:38.520 align:middle line:84%
will not be forgotten because
in the post-disclosure world,

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.670 align:middle line:84%
we're going to hear a lot from
the government and the Pentagon

00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and the military
intelligence complex.

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I think the TTSA is going
to do a lot of lobbying.

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But the people need to
be represented well,

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:51.980 align:middle line:84%
which is why, as soon as I
things hitting a certain point,

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:53.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get some support.

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back
to Washington, DC

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and start full-time lobbying
the Congress as the people's

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.240 align:middle line:90%
representative.

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's appropriate.

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking forward to
that, and let's see how it goes.

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.690 align:middle line:90%
But we may be close.

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:11.220 align:middle line:90%
We may be really close.

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage people to
learn everything they can

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:15.630 align:middle line:90%
about the To the Stars Academy.

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:19.260 align:middle line:10%
I have an over 100
interviews about that thing

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.720 align:middle line:10%
on my internet right now,
all the video and everything.

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.060 align:middle line:10%
I got hundreds of articles.

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.440 align:middle line:10%
You can go to
paradigmresearchgroup.org,

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.500 align:middle line:10%
and then go to their website
and follow that and study it.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, listen to
some of the skeptics,

00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:32.610 align:middle line:90%
read some of the criticism.

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But I encourage people to
try to keep an open mind.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.900 align:middle line:10%
And my personal view--

00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:40.800 align:middle line:10%
and I'm not shy about
this-- after watching this

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.020 align:middle line:10%
carefully and learning
everything I can,

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:45.030 align:middle line:10%
this is absolutely legitimate.

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:47.710 align:middle line:84%
It is in the interest
of the American people.

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It has the potential to
end the truth embargo.

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stephen, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief".

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:53.397 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: It's my pleasure.

00:59:53.397 --> 00:59:56.095 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to our first
post-disclosure interview.

00:59:56.095 --> 00:59:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
happen soon enough.

00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.803 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have it here for
you on "Beyond Belief".

00:59:59.803 --> 01:00:04.230 align:middle line:10%
The quest to reveal an
extraterrestrial presence

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:06.510 align:middle line:10%
on this planet
sooner than later.

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:07.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.180 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
