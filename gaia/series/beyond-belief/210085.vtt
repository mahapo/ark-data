>>ANDREW BARTZIS:
It was a tied score,

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.120 align:middle line:84%
bottom of the ninth inning,
our team hit a home run,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.380 align:middle line:90%
and my world changed.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.812 align:middle line:84%
At first I thought I would
just be a news reporter.

00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
that it would involve

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.620 align:middle line:84%
business, websites, the
internet, before any

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:90%
of that ever existed.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:84%
We're a culmination of 66
worlds in a binary star system

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that I call the Galactic
Ascension Machine.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Not all soul families are good.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Example, the elites
that rule this world.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of young children
who have traumas,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
they could smell the
mouse fart next door.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say, there's
well over 10,000 species

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.910 align:middle line:84%
actively invested
with the journey

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.965 align:middle line:90%

Andrew Bartzis is with
us, a Reiki master

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:10%

known as a galactic historian.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:90%

Andrew, welcome to

>>BARTZIS: Well, thank you.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.865 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be here with you.

>>NOORY: How in the world
did you get involved in this?

00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: It actually
started out at a baseball game

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.795 align:middle line:90%
when I was 9 years old.

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:18.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Cleveland Indians.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.868 align:middle line:84%
It was a tied score,
bottom of the ninth inning,

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:24.785 align:middle line:84%
our team hit a home run,
and my world changed.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.243 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They weren't playing
my Detroit Tigers, were they?

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: No, no, no, no.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:10%
What happened is, I began
to understand everyone

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:10%
who was in the stadium live.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:10%
Who they were.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:10%
What they were.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.775 align:middle line:84%
10,000 generations into the
past and 10,000 generations

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just
hit you like that?

00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:40.383 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: It literally
hit me like that,

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
with an awareness I had
to do something with it.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:10%
And that I had to live
a life as a young person

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:10%
and an adult person,
not in a separation

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:10%
but in a co-creative reality.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, I was
learning a language

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:84%
of multidimensional
reality, such as children

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
who learn to speak two
languages at a young age

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
think differently when you
hook them up to a brain

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
scan process.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And part of my journey and
my activation at that point

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.665 align:middle line:84%
was to be in both worlds without
competition between the others.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you do
this all on your own?

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Pretty much, yeah.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:84%
There were things
that helped me get me

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
through the various
humps of the process,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:84%
but everything was
personal choice.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Every aspect from age 9,
10, 12 was personal choice.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Do I dedicate myself to this?

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Do I dedicate to not have
a competitional process

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
between what's going
on in the other world

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and what's going
on in this world?

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Can I still be a
human being here?

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
If I can't be a
human being here,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
there's no point in
having the greater

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:90%
experiences on the other side.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you realized at a
very young age, 9 years old,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.727 align:middle line:84%
this is what you wanted
to do for a living.

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: At first,
when I was young,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would just be a
news reporter on CBS News,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:84%
giving an update on the
changes that the humanity was

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.972 align:middle line:84%
going through, like
a two-minute spot.

00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
that it would involve

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
business, websites, the
internet, before any

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:90%
of that ever existed.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the
aha moment for you

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.005 align:middle line:90%
beyond the 9-year-old thing?

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: I did a sweat lodge
with the Huichol Indians,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Brant
Secunda, when I was 20.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
those moments where

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
the communal prayer of
everybody that was there

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:90%
completed a circuit in me.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I grew up Greek Orthodox, and
I understand what prayer was,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
but this was
something different.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.785 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love the
Greeks, by the way.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.162 align:middle line:90%
A great community in St. Louis.

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: It was palpable.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:90%
It was internal.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:90%
It was external.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:90%
It was purifying.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded me
of people I knew

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:84%
in the past and the experience
at the baseball game.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Why did I have to
know who they were?

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
10,000 generations into the
past and into the future.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we're coming into a
confluence of all these beings

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
who want to be incarnated
here, now on earth.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's a limitation
process of who can get born

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.880 align:middle line:90%
and who dies every day.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So the greater journey of
understanding why people

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:90%
come into this world.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The type of experience
they're looking for.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands
of other worlds, what

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:90%
makes this world different?

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And why did I come here
with this point of view

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:90%
of the galactic historian?

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:84%
People come here because,
this is what I call,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.042 align:middle line:84%
you get your double PhD in the
School of Hard Knocks here.

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:28.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: You learn source
connection and source

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:90%
disconnection.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
The main role of
this world is, we're

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.610 align:middle line:84%
a culmination of 66 worlds
in a binary star system

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:84%
that I call the Galactic
Ascension Machine.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
All those beings
who over millions

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.050 align:middle line:84%
of years engaged in negative
forms of time travel,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
time travel erasure, they
created a toxic pollution

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:90%
amongst many other worlds.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
The higher-level entities
and founder beings

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
put everything in
one solar system that

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:90%
were the greatest offenders.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:90%
And earth is at the peak of it.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.125 align:middle line:84%
It's where you learn your
greatest amount of source

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:90%
connection, disconnection.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.035 align:middle line:84%
It's where you can resolve
the unresolvable here.

00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
galactic historian, Andrew?

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: It's a
being who's lived

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
the entire dramatic process
through each and every soul

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
family in the greater
galactic eras of light.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking years,
think of-- an era of light

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:84%
might be how much a
solar system or a galaxy

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:90%
has grown in life force.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It reaches this point
where it's maximum,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:90%
then the galaxy expands.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:84%
We know that this
regularly happens.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
The galaxy go through
expansion processes.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, you're
there to record it,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and all the individual
dramas that are around it,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
to try to prevent
it or accept it.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And here, the galactic
historian, meaning,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I've lived in just about all
of the soul families that have

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
secrets, or don't have secrets,
or have one point of view that

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:90%
the others don't.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It's all coalesced in one place.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
On Gaia's program, "Microdose,"
they talk about diving

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:90%
into the Akashic records.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.955 align:middle line:84%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:05.755 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been referred to
as the Hall of Records,

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
the Library of Light, the Mind
of God, God's Remembrance.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:84%
There's many ways that
they are referred to.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:10%
They hold what we would
call our past, present,

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.500 align:middle line:10%
and potential future.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's because we are
here, in linear time,

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And we've agreed to this
time-space continuum that says,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.622 align:middle line:84%
well, there is a past,
there is a present,

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:90%
and there's the future.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But where these records
reside, we could say,

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
is really in the eternal
now, in the present moment,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and so there is no past,
there is no future,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:90%
there is only now.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> When I explain about
the eighth dimension

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and the Akashic records, I used
to explain it like if it were

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:84%
a library or Wikipedia, where
you can go and look for any

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:90%
information you want.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But for the eighth
dimension, when

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
you realize that every
dimension is just

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
a perspective of
reality, you will

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:84%
realize that the
eighth dimension is not

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
the place where you have to go
to look for that information.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But you have to become
in order to see and feel

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.476 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It would seem that accessing
the Akashic records is a more

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical process than merely
reading words on a physical

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:90%
page.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
So how is human consciousness
connected to the Akashic realm?

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> If we think that we are a
leaf or a flower in a tree,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and because we are a leaf
or a flower we are trapped

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:90%
in the tree.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
is because we didn't understand
that the flower and the leaf

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:90%
are the product of the tree.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:90%
They are not something separate.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
They are trying
to feed the tree.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
With every experience,
with every breath,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:90%
you are feeding the network.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic records
is this library

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.670 align:middle line:84%
where every book that
haven't been written yet,

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.715 align:middle line:84%
and every book that was
written, shares the information

00:08:15.715 --> 00:08:16.515 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:08:16.515 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Andrew, is it easy to
access the Akashic records?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yes, for me.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
doing it for so long,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and I've reached an internal
process where there's

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
no competition, no
hierarchical order

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
to have access, as long as I
remain in a neutral perceptive

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:84%
state, not allowing
information to stick.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.419 align:middle line:84%
I call it the sacred neutral
perspective, where I just

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:84%
give myself that choice that
no matter what the data is,

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:90%
it is just data.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.935 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're just impartial.

00:08:45.935 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Well,
there's the next level

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:84%
of impartial, where I've
made it a personal choice

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:84%
how to speed up or slow
down the information.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So that if I'm trying
to perceive something,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:84%
it's coming at me in
many different forms,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:84%
often in the form
of a coded light.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you use
the Akashic records?

00:09:03.685 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Well,
I can read people,

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:90%
like many other psychics.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Data is available at
any moment of time,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.975 align:middle line:84%
it's just a matter of how
I'm going to process it.

00:09:11.975 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:84%
When I'm working with a person,
the first thing I look at

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:84%
is their atlas and
axis, their C1 and C2.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It says everything that's
going on in their reality.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like, is the spinal
column in alignment?

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Is it not aligned?

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Is it emotionally disabled?

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.315 align:middle line:90%
Is it emotionally enabled?

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can tell that?

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yeah.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And use the Akashic
record to determine,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:90%
is this a past life process?

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Is this a DNA issue going back
to their mother and father?

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Do they have cancers?

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:84%
All those things can become
a part of that journey.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter of
what they're ready for.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a human being, when
we're in the mother's womb,

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
are we developing
mentally at that point?

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yeah.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:84%
From the moment the
seed meets the egg,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
you are in what's called
"womb time," where

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.310 align:middle line:84%
our astral worlds will break
down to the North Pole,

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.590 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors, those
that came before us.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.042 align:middle line:84%
And the South
Pole, the ancestors

00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:90%
that are going to come.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:90%
The one that are planning birth.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Those astral societies
that are in the South Pole,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:84%
as soon as that egg and
a sperm meet together,

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
you go into this state
of leaving the no time

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and entering time, where the
beginning of your consciousness

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:84%
expands with the different
growth of the cells.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The heart's the first
organ that's born.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:90%
The tongue is the second organ.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
develop, you begin

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.240 align:middle line:90%
to plan spiritual contracts.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Who's your third grade teacher?

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.815 align:middle line:84%
Is your mother and father going
to be a verbal arguer early,

00:10:31.815 --> 00:10:33.315 align:middle line:84%
or are they going
to learn about it?

00:10:33.315 --> 00:10:34.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're
planning that out?

00:10:34.575 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yeah.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:84%
We're planning all of this
out, but we're planning out

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:90%
the infinite potentials.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Free will is still
a clear choice.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:90%
After birth, what happens?

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: After that breath
that says, I want to live

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and I will not fail,
my breath to live,

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:84%
there's the first 18 months
where you can change contracts.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.078 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, instead of using
wood to build a house,

00:10:59.078 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:90%
you need to use concrete.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Because that's all available.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:84%
You have to build a
different high school,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:84%
or you have to make a
different group of friends.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And other free
will that involves

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:84%
learning social
activities, interacting

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:90%
with friends and family.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Or making a choice,
are you going

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:84%
to be a professional
pianist the whole life.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what's coming
out to you at a young age.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.427 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When do you
make those choices?

00:11:19.427 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Early on.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Baby size?

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.845 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: 2 to 6.

00:11:23.845 --> 00:11:24.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yeah, 2 to 6.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
While we're still forming the
majority of our personality,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and how family
members influence us.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.077 align:middle line:90%
What does money mean?

00:11:35.077 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
For the longest time,
there were a lot

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:84%
of people that were
heavily confused,

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
because at an early age,
they were taught money

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.022 align:middle line:90%
is more important than love.

00:11:44.022 --> 00:11:45.927 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
dangerous, isn't it?

00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Very dangerous.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And you see a lot of
cultures and societies

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.465 align:middle line:90%
that function that way.

00:11:50.465 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does free
will play into this?

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.685 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: It is the
most important gift

00:11:54.685 --> 00:11:55.685 align:middle line:90%
we have as human beings.

00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:56.893 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we have a choice?

00:11:56.893 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Absolutely,
we have a choice.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Just because something's
been infinitely planned out,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean you can't choose.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:84%
All a fetus is doing
is, in a dream state,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:84%
looking at the unique
potentials of what

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
the 10 billion human beings
that live on this world

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:90%
could potentially be.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
If you were to see it as an
algorithm that Joe was born,

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Joe meets Anne, Joe and Anne
have a child, all of that

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is in an algorithm of what it
takes for them to get together.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of that's free
will, co-creation,

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:90%
for them to do that.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:90%
At any time they could quit.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what
age, Andrew, do you

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:90%
start counseling these people?

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: At a bunch of ages.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.485 align:middle line:84%
I've done some teenagers
and some younger people.

00:12:37.485 --> 00:12:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they get it?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: It depends.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's in a
different place.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And part of using the
Akashic record is--

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
what I see is, what will affect
them six months from now?

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.592 align:middle line:84%
What are the words that
I can come up with--

00:12:49.592 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or a year or
two years from now.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Or a
year or two years--

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:84%
that actually gives
them the greatest chance

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:90%
for potential change.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.633 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's somebody
that's a professional adult

00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:01.050 align:middle line:84%

depression their whole life,

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
spiritual motivation.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And do you have
a daily practice.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.060 align:middle line:84%
A daily practice is more
than just meditation.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
It's an enthusiastic
effort to do,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:84%
whether it's meditation,
yoga, free thinking, artwork.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
You're doing something to
better yourself and grow

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.805 align:middle line:84%
your natural energy field
with that enthusiastic effort.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:84%
If we knew 0.01%
of our past lives,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
we'd never make
the same girlfriend

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Our government would never
be the way it is today.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.310 align:middle line:90%
That's just 0.01.

00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%

00:13:52.235 --> 00:13:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The past lives explain
something in current life,

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.520 align:middle line:84%
because the past lives have
a direct connection to life

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:84%
They explain something
we're working on

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
to change in life today,
which is what we call karma.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:84%
They also can explain
a relationship,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:90%
a phobia, a physical symptom.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The soul is required to evolve
and we're required to learn,

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:84%
so we gather karma and
we also gather dharma.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're working
on in our current life.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Karma is a free-will
decision we made

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:84%
in a past life that, perhaps,
wasn't the best decision.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not a permanent
black mark on your soul.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:84%
It's something you can
balance in a subsequent life.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
You have a life plan,
life intentions,

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and then you basically
come in with free will.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Many humans experience
profound suffering during

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:90%
their lifetime.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So why would a soul choose
to come into a body knowing

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.585 align:middle line:90%
it will be painful?

00:14:58.585 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:10%
>> It's perfectly plausible
to me that from the framework

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.280 align:middle line:10%
outside of this one, we would
choose to come into it knowing

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:10%
that we were going to be having
a certain kind of suffering.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
from that framework

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's time-limited,
that you'll be out of it.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.570 align:middle line:10%
But then once you get
into this framework,

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:10%
see, that knowledge
is blocked, so

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:10%
that you're faced there
with the raw suffering

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:10%
without the insight.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, the event, that you
chose it in the first place,

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:90%
but also, that it will be over.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most fascinating
parts of reincarnation is

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:84%
the idea of a soul group or
a group of souls that choose

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.060 align:middle line:90%
to incarnate together.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:10%
>> I know this from client,
after client, after client,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:10%
where what they come upon
at times at the soul level

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.770 align:middle line:10%
of a regression, is a group of
souls with whom they incarnate

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:10%
repetitively.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Simply put, I like to
call it a soul pod.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
A soul pod means, most of
us have about 10 to 20 souls

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
with whom we
incarnate most often.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
If you're the parent
and there's a child,

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:84%
you made an agreement
at the soul level

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:90%
to be parent and child.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:90%
You came together for a reason.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more, Andrew,
about these soul groups.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.540 align:middle line:90%
How do they accumulate?

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: I call
them soul families.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're not in
one soul family.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
If we see ourselves
as ancient beings--

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a big believer, there
are very few young souls here

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:90%
in our reality.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the place where
people get their double PhD,

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and whatever young
souls that are here,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:90%
they made it out of effort.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:84%
A soul family,
you can have many.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Example, starseeds, you're a
pleiadian, you're an arcturian,

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and you come to this
world with the attributes

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:90%
from those other worlds.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And those attributes
fade after a lifetime,

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
or they get stronger
the more that you

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.515 align:middle line:90%
work with the different groups.

00:16:57.515 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we aware of them?

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: At some level.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Not all soul families
are good, though.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Example, if we look at the
elites that rule this world,

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:84%
they're not commonly accepted
as a normal soul family.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
They're at an elite status,
with an elite level,

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.227 align:middle line:84%
and only allow a certain
group of people within that.

00:17:19.227 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've got
their own agenda.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.643 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: They've got
their own agenda that

00:17:22.643 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
lasts hundreds of
thousands of years,

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:90%
and it's a closed door club.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Versus the common
Indigenous group

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:84%
that shares their culture, their
teachings, their healings, who

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
are open to everyone,
no matter how

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.592 align:middle line:90%
advanced or unadvanced you are.

00:17:38.592 --> 00:17:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And then there are, like
the person was saying,

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
pods, people you
regularly incarnate with.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:84%
These are the core people
that you're going lifetime

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:90%
to lifetime with.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:10%
Where this person may be
your regular eighth grade

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:10%
teacher, or this person may be
your regular first failed love.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:10%
Because you know, each time
you get that failed love,

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:10%
there's going to be a lesson
that comes from it that

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:10%
makes you a stronger person.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And that one person
you chose was

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.147 align:middle line:84%
great as a failed first love,
but 35 years later, they're

00:18:07.147 --> 00:18:08.105 align:middle line:90%
still your best friend.

00:18:08.105 --> 00:18:10.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of karma?

00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:10.805 align:middle line:90%
Is it real?

00:18:10.805 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Karma can be minute
and it can be great.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It can be as minute as
not tipping your server,

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and it can be as great
as starting a war.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.635 align:middle line:84%
And then the sub-things
that are attached to that.

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But does it
come back and bite you?

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Sometimes it
bites you like a gnat,

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.315 align:middle line:84%
and other times it
bites you in the wallet.

00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:31.115 align:middle line:90%
Other times--

>>BARTZIS: If one decides
I want to start a war

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and I don't care about
the effects of it, that

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:84%
means all the choices
that are handed

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
to the downward
positions of those

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:84%
that are going to enforce the
war, the karma goes up to you.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:90%
The veracity.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:84%
That means you've
made a decision

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and all those underlings still
have an aspect of the karma,

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
but the totality
of it goes uphill.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That old saying, what
goes around comes around--

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Correct.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --is pretty
poignant, isn't it?

00:19:07.835 --> 00:19:08.635 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Mm-hmm.

00:19:08.635 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's why war has tied
our karmic cycles and journeys

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:84%
together, which is so
hard to break right now.

>>NOORY: How did you learn this?

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Trial and error?

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.575 align:middle line:90%
Or did it just come to you?

>>BARTZIS: Watching people.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I understood
my own natural karmas.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I understood why I had the
experience at a young age

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that there needed to be
people that could understand

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
the multidimensional
functionality of this world

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and begin to help people
break out of mediocrity.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And once breaking
out of mediocrity

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and there's no iron hold--
because this world has

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:90%
got an iron hold on mediocrity.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And once that happens, and
you are confident enough

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
in your own self, and you
don't need external validation,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:84%
learning about karma
is the nuances of it.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and relating them
to how to heal them.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Part of what I do is, I
study people's traumas.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Decades of doing this.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And understanding
this type of trauma

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
creates this type of
karma, this type of karma

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:84%
has this type of
resolution, and then

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:84%
pairing them together
with the right resolution.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
do that, what does

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.016 align:middle line:90%
that do for the individual?

00:20:27.016 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: It unlocks
their greater potential.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Some of them come
with no purpose,

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.993 align:middle line:84%
just like sheets in the
wind, and all of a sudden,

00:20:34.993 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
there's a circuit complete
in them that hadn't

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.118 align:middle line:90%
been completed in their life.

00:20:38.118 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates
trauma, Andrew?

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Anything from
parents arguing at a young age

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:90%
to violence.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.837 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on how
much it's damaged--

00:20:48.837 --> 00:20:49.637 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Illness.

00:20:49.637 --> 00:20:50.804 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: --the core youth.

00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it can be
youths, that also.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.982 align:middle line:84%
Cancer at a young age does a
tremendous amount of things

00:20:55.982 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:90%
to the young children's mind.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh my God, that's one
of the scariest, saddest things

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.635 align:middle line:84%
I've seen, when you go
through a ward of children

00:21:03.635 --> 00:21:04.435 align:middle line:90%
who have cancer.

00:21:04.435 --> 00:21:05.435 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: That's right.

00:21:05.435 --> 00:21:08.405 align:middle line:84%
And each and every one of them
is afraid, yet still connected

00:21:08.405 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to their little spirit inside
that says, I won't give up.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did they
get picked for that trauma?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: That's before life.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.075 align:middle line:84%
That seed meets the egg,
they've chosen that.

00:21:20.075 --> 00:21:22.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That something happened
in a previous life to them?

00:21:22.575 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Not always.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.195 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's just
about the experience.

00:21:26.195 --> 00:21:27.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or is it rotten luck?

00:21:27.555 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: No.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
As I said, we come here for
learning source connection

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and disconnection at
the highest level.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, you're
a kid with leukemia

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
at 9, with parents who don't
have the money to afford it,

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:84%
but somehow, they've
got to get it together.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And the love that it
took to get it together,

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
for the mother and father
to raise that money

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:84%
to heal that child, is
the unique experience

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:84%
the child and the mother
and father signed up for.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it changed
the story of love.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.956 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What traumas
do you see the most?

00:21:58.956 --> 00:22:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Tremendously,
sexual abuse trauma.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's so common amongst
our world right now.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All ages?

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yeah, all ages.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:90%
And then physical trauma.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:16.020 align:middle line:84%
It's created a subculture of
very destructive personalities

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:90%
that refuse to seek help.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you say, refuse
to seek help, why is that?

00:22:21.265 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Does a
psychopath have emotions?

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Do they have regret?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.855 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: So
they're never going

00:22:27.855 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
to seek something that
isn't to their reality.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's a good point.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Unfortunately,
the traumatized world

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that we live in, with the
elites that rule this world,

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.505 align:middle line:84%
trauma-based victimology
creates psychopaths.

00:22:43.505 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On that
subject of trauma,

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.035 align:middle line:84%
Tiffany Barsotti talks to
Regina Meredith about that.

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:49.835 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:54.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Most of the people I know who
are noted as psychics and make

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:10%
their living
successfully as psychics,

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:10%
have had some pretty severe
trauma in their early lives.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to think if there
are many exceptions to that.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't know anyone
who is profoundly psychic,

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:84%
who just had an
idyllic childhood.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this idea about
idyllic childhood and--

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:84%
for those of us that have had
these profound gifts just given

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:84%
to us, making sense out of
what the environment was like.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Why were we given these gifts if
they end in such profound ways?

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:90%
What do we do with them?

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And why did we have to come out
of such contrasting situations

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.207 align:middle line:90%
in order to create that?

00:23:40.207 --> 00:23:41.915 align:middle line:84%
>> I would argue it
slightly differently.

00:23:41.915 --> 00:23:42.715 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:42.715 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say, you
weren't given anything.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.015 align:middle line:90%
You came in with these.

00:23:47.015 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:84%
These are talent skills that
had been most likely already

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:84%
present in previous
times and incarnations

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:90%
that you came in with.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
But why is it a person has
to be traumatized and almost

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
separated out from the herd
in order to really start

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.300 align:middle line:90%
implementing these skill sets?

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:90%
I do find that.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
The why, I don't
fully understand.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But I do know-- and this herd
mentality is very important

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.640 align:middle line:90%
to also understand.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're going
to effect a change,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.795 align:middle line:84%
whether it be in our life
before it can be in anybody

00:24:21.795 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:84%
else's-- because we certainly
need to be on the operating

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:90%
table first--

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that these things
really demand--

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.043 align:middle line:84%
These events, what I
had to live through

00:24:31.043 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and what many others
have had to live through,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.570 align:middle line:84%
they demand a different
kind of attentiveness

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:39.020 align:middle line:84%
to the energies that are really
coursing through our blood,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:84%
coursing through our bones,
that need to be directed.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And left undirected,
there's another part.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
In my anger as a kid,
I could move objects

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and I could only do
it when I was angry.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.125 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
kinetic energy in anger.

00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:90%
And stuff would go flying.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:84%
My mom, there would be
music that she'd be playing,

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, I really don't
want to hear that right now.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And the record
player-- the needle

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.970 align:middle line:84%
would lift off the record,
return back, and go back.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, Tiffany,
did you just do that?

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh!

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I guess, I did.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't want
to hear that right now.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.740 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with her, Andrew?

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: For the most part.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I notice you
cringing a little bit

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:25.760 align:middle line:90%
on some things she said.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: We choose words and
the semantics of words at time.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I have met many psychics
that haven't been

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.935 align:middle line:90%
traumatized at a young age.

00:25:34.935 --> 00:25:35.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:35.735 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Now, did I go
through traumas at a young age?

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.770 align:middle line:90%
No different than anyone else.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:90%
I was not abused.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.812 align:middle line:90%
I went through my own choice.

00:25:43.812 --> 00:25:45.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem like you
have your act together.

00:25:45.895 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: But I also knew, no
matter how damaged others are,

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I didn't take it on.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of young
children who have traumas,

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I use this terminology, they
could smell the mouse fart

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:84%
next door out of their
intuitiveness, oversensitivity.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, that creates
another trauma within children.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:84%
They're so tuned to
their environment

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that they're always
in data overload.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And another thing is, trauma is
one of those things we're here

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.540 align:middle line:90%
to experience.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not all bad.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Example, if you just use the
common thing of a breaking

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:90%
of a relationship.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.127 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
those relationships

00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:90%
come back together--

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you
get a better one.

00:26:33.335 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: You got a better one.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Part of learning
how to live here

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.410 align:middle line:84%
is to deal with the
negativity that can happen

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and how we gracefully
deal with it.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.291 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it helpful
to make mistakes and learn

00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:46.455 align:middle line:90%
from them?

00:26:46.455 --> 00:26:47.372 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Absolutely.

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:48.625 align:middle line:90%
I make mistakes all the time.

00:26:48.625 --> 00:26:50.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
learn from them.

00:26:50.095 --> 00:26:50.515 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Absolutely.

00:26:50.515 --> 00:26:50.751 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't make
the same mistake twice.

00:26:50.751 --> 00:26:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: And there are
times that I repeat it.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.565 align:middle line:84%
I repeat the dumb mistake
over and over again.

00:26:54.565 --> 00:26:54.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:26:54.985 --> 00:26:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Sure.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like everyone else.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Part of trauma or part
of just being a psychic

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:84%
is, what do you do
to not hold on to it?

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
What spiritual practices, or
what I call spiritual hygiene,

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:90%
do I create for myself?

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Just like you would
vacuum your floors

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and change your sheets
in your environment,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:84%
there's something you have
to do with your own self that

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:84%
helps you maintain a form
of spiritual hygiene.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Or a cleanliness that allows you
to continue to do this higher

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.455 align:middle line:84%
density subject matter without
absorbing the negative energy.

00:27:29.455 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
do that for themselves?

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Very few.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:34.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I thought.

00:27:34.865 --> 00:27:36.035 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS:
Unfortunately, very few.

00:27:36.035 --> 00:27:36.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unfortunately.

00:27:36.993 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: And part of what I've
been teaching since early 2012

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
is a delicate
balance between what

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
is self-healing, self-nurturing,
and self-mastery.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Self-healing means you've
got to love yourself enough.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Self-nurturing,
it's a form of love,

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to plan how
to nurture yourself and know

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.970 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with you.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And then self-mastery
is that journey

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:90%
to healing and loving yourself.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
ceremony and ritual?

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Are they two different things?

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: They can be the same.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But ceremony is a challenge
we create in ourself, where

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:84%
we take our daily
spiritual practices

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:90%
and we come to a moment.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Like a solstice or an equinox,
where we intentionally

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.573 align:middle line:84%
raise our frequency,
use our prayer process,

00:28:19.573 --> 00:28:20.990 align:middle line:84%
whatever religion
or non-religion,

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.730 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Where we've gone through
an extended process.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:84%
This is my previous
peak of energy

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and the ceremony is
now to get my energy

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit higher.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And every time
you do a ceremony,

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.550 align:middle line:84%
it would be to
raise your frequency

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and go through that personal
challenge of what does

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.840 align:middle line:90%
it take to raise my frequency.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it difficult to do?

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: No.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.450 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.595 align:middle line:84%
It just takes effort--
enthusiastic effort.

00:28:43.595 --> 00:28:44.762 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Meditation?

00:28:44.762 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: That
can be one of them.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
But I'm one of those
people that you need

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:90%
as many tools in the tools box.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Because there are many people
that just can't meditate,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.052 align:middle line:90%
but they can sun gaze.

00:28:54.052 --> 00:28:55.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can't stand still.

00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: They can't stand
still, for whatever reason.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.755 align:middle line:84%
Then there are other
techniques that are out there.

00:28:59.755 --> 00:29:01.400 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
techniques out there.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Fill your toolbox up
with whatever technique.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the point is, if you can
have that enthusiastic effort

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.490 align:middle line:84%
in doing it, versus
it being a chore,

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.100 align:middle line:84%
you will get so much more
out of the actual effort.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
do to teach people

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.535 align:middle line:90%
how to live in this mode?

00:29:17.535 --> 00:29:19.265 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Choice, first.

00:29:19.265 --> 00:29:20.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain.

00:29:20.065 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: And know
what your choices are.

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Example, if you're trying
to have a spiritual hygiene,

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:84%
your choice is to
follow through.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:90%
You have to be committed.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Without commitment, without
courage, and all those things

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that keep you
committed, you are going

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:84%
to have a challenging time
discovering spiritual hygiene.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Discovering ritual and
ceremony, and how they

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:84%
can cleanse and purify
your internal thoughts

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:90%
and structures.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.378 align:middle line:84%
And the daily journey
becomes a weekly journey.

00:29:47.378 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And the weekly journey
becomes a monthly journey,

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.610 align:middle line:90%
which becomes a yearly journey.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:84%
If we're chronicling our
journey, writing down

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.710 align:middle line:84%
what's happened to us,
we can learn hindsight

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:84%
by learning back and
looking at those documents

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.040 align:middle line:90%
that we've written.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest things
I say, if you're not

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:84%
recording your spiritual journey
or chronicling your journey,

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.616 align:middle line:90%
you're faking the experience.

00:30:07.616 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
practice what you preach?

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Thousands.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Thousands, and thousands, and
thousands, in their own way.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By themselves?

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.905 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: By themselves, yes.

00:30:17.905 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Self-taught.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Well,
I do what's called

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.598 align:middle line:90%
self-illumination teachings.

00:30:22.598 --> 00:30:23.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:30:23.515 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: What does it take
for you to be self-illuminated?

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:84%
We've heard an infinite amount
of stories of rags to riches.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:84%
The same thing can
happen with spirituality.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a common set
of beliefs, no matter

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:84%
what religion or
spiritual science

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.490 align:middle line:84%
it is, that gives the person the
best chance at personal growth.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Understanding what a
sovereign being is,

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.020 align:middle line:90%
separate of the legal world.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Are you sovereign enough
to hold your own energy

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:52.460 align:middle line:90%
and not give it away?

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Building on all
of those concepts,

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:84%
where self-illumination
becomes natural.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Where you're no longer
needing external validation

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:90%
for your internal truths.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we started
the program, Andrew,

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.645 align:middle line:84%
we talked about how you
started at 9 years old.

00:31:07.645 --> 00:31:08.445 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yep.

00:31:08.445 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here you are now.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.845 align:middle line:90%
How much have you learned?

00:31:12.845 --> 00:31:14.005 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Just a scratch.

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all?

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I think you've learned
more than that.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: I have.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.570 align:middle line:90%
But what applies?

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I made the choice.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:84%
At a very early age,
I asked the questions

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I needed to ask to
the Akashic records.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.107 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
got your answers?

00:31:28.107 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Now, it's a
matter of living here.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to know the future.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.943 align:middle line:84%
Because if I did, what point
would it be, to be here.

00:31:35.943 --> 00:31:37.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you alter
the future, if you knew?

00:31:37.985 --> 00:31:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Probably.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I came
in with the contract

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
to not permanently
know the futures.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:90%
I see it as a weather forecast.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked
earlier about rituals.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Chris Atwood was talking
on Gaia's "Inspirations"

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:90%
about the power of that.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> We specifically use rituals
to say that rituals are

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.523 align:middle line:84%
conscious, intentional practices
you use to improve your life.

00:32:01.523 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And you make them
habitual, because they

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.065 align:middle line:90%
do improve your life.

00:32:04.065 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the physical act of
a ritual help you actually

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:84%
manifest something a little
bit stronger than just

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.515 align:middle line:90%
the intention process?

00:32:11.515 --> 00:32:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a great question.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.510 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, what
helps us manifest

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.980 align:middle line:84%
anything is the power
of our awareness,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
our ability to connect with the
deepest part of our own nature.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And then bring that
manifestation from that

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:90%
place out into the world.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Intention can be very
powerful when the individual

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.630 align:middle line:84%
is connected to that
part of themselves,

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to that deep, inner part, what
we call your spiritual core

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.400 align:middle line:90%
or transcendent core.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.387 align:middle line:84%
But rituals are
really a mechanism

00:32:38.387 --> 00:32:39.720 align:middle line:90%
to be able to connect with that.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're not talking
necessarily about lighting

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.380 align:middle line:84%
a candle and sitting in
a meditation ritual type

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
everyday, super practical--

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.895 align:middle line:84%
you're reframing the idea
of ritual in this book,

00:32:49.895 --> 00:32:50.695 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:32:50.695 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're talking
about both, frankly.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.285 align:middle line:84%
Because we talk about everyday
rituals, which are easy,

00:32:55.285 --> 00:32:57.160 align:middle line:84%
simple things you can
incorporate in your day

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.320 align:middle line:84%
as conscious,
intentional practices.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And we also talk about
ceremonial rituals, which

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:84%
are more involved,
which may involve

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.280 align:middle line:84%
lighting candles, and
music, and incense, and all

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.630 align:middle line:90%
of those things.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.750 align:middle line:84%
They actually serve two
very distinct purposes.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
A ritual has many purposes from
many different perspectives.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, "improve"
is a relative term.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But what you'll see
is, in every industry,

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.540 align:middle line:84%
people who are really,
really successful

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.210 align:middle line:84%
have all incorporated their
rituals into their life

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.160 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.550 align:middle line:84%
You see that sports
players use rituals

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to improve their
performance, to be

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:84%
able to get their mind
into the game, as it were.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Musicians and
artists use rituals

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.150 align:middle line:84%
to spark their
creativity, so that they

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.870 align:middle line:84%
can be the best at
what their passion is.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Business leaders use rituals
to create cohesive teams

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and to create strong
corporate cultures.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Celebrities use
rituals to create

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:84%
balance between their personal
lives and their work lives.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, all of those
are improving your life.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.350 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Much like what
you've been saying.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: There are
little micro-rituals.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Example, the place
that you sleep

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.770 align:middle line:84%
is something you should do a
regular cleansing, purification

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:12.760 align:middle line:90%
ritual.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.278 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, the
New Agers use sage,

00:34:15.278 --> 00:34:16.570 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't have to be that.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.159 align:middle line:90%
It can be prayers.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.350 align:middle line:90%
It can be intentional energy.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.239 align:middle line:84%
Just that first
layer, this is where

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:25.659 align:middle line:84%
I sleep and I'm going
to consciously apply

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:29.440 align:middle line:84%
my sacred wisdom, so that
the place that I sleep

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.745 align:middle line:84%
has my love and
protection behind it.

00:34:32.745 --> 00:34:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the four corners

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.828 align:middle line:84%
of the bed, the four
corners of the room.

00:34:35.828 --> 00:34:37.854 align:middle line:84%
You can make it as
extensive as you want.

00:34:37.854 --> 00:34:39.854 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems like a
simple formula, Andrew.

00:34:39.854 --> 00:34:40.858 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: It is.

00:34:40.858 --> 00:34:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it's
just like you would

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:84%
vacuum your floors in your
house or change your sheets,

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.500 align:middle line:84%
there are certain
repetitive rituals

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.199 align:middle line:84%
that can be incorporated
into everyday life.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you tap into other
sources to do what you do?

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yes.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are those sources?

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Are they ETs, or
anything like that?

00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Yeah.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.060 align:middle line:84%
There's collective
consciousnesses

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that are not of this world,
that have a very different view

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:90%
of our incarnational process.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:10.990 align:middle line:84%
There are groups that
are tens of thousands

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:14.080 align:middle line:84%
of different species
that have created

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.160 align:middle line:84%
a temporary collective to try
to understand what we are here.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That many, huh?

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Let's
just say, there's

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.250 align:middle line:84%
well over 10,000 species
actively invested

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:31.835 align:middle line:84%
with the journey to awaken
or to keep us asleep.

00:35:31.835 --> 00:35:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we all access
our Akashic records,

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:40.640 align:middle line:84%
which you've learned how to do,
will we be happy by doing that,

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.350 align:middle line:90%
or will we be scared?

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Not everyone
will know right away

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:90%
what question to ask.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
question should be what?

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BARTZIS: Who am I?

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.680 align:middle line:10%
Where am I?

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.120 align:middle line:10%
Why am I?

00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:01.780 align:middle line:10%
But oftentimes, somebody
who is run by financial gain

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.745 align:middle line:10%
will want to know
tomorrow's lottery numbers.

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or stock holdings.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.137 align:middle line:84%
>>BARTZIS: Which is
personal responsibility now.

00:36:08.137 --> 00:36:10.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Andrew, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:36:10.345 --> 00:36:10.855 align:middle line:90%
