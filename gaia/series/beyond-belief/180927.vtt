>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we've got
a great guest for you today.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.549 align:middle line:84%
George Haas is the Founder
and Premier Investigator

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
of the Mars research group known
as the Cydonia Institute that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:90%
was established back in 1991.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:84%
He is also a member of the
planetary SETI Institute,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and he is with us right
here on "Beyond Belief."

George, great to
have you with us.

>>GEORGE HAAS: Well, thanks
for having me on, George.

>>NOORY: Looking
forward to this.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.954 align:middle line:84%
You're a great guest on the
radio show "Coast to Coast."

00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to be a marvelous

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.510 align:middle line:90%
guest on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I can feel it
because I know what

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:90%
you're going to talk about.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved
in Mars research?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Well, my
interest in Mars

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:10%
began back in 1976 with
the early Viking landings

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:10%
of the twin Vikings and
the snapshots they took

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.170 align:middle line:10%
of the famous face on Mars.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:84%
That is where my interest
in the Red Planet started.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you looked
at this picture of the face

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, like so
many other people,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.430 align:middle line:84%
it truly does look like
a face, doesn't it?

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, it has a
lot of facial aspects.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
NASA has done over the years

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and very successful is convince
the public that the face is

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:84%
a symmetrical human-like
face which it really isn't.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:84%
The face on Mars is a
two-faced bifurcated mask,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.151 align:middle line:84%
not like a symmetrical
human face.

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks somewhat
Egyptian, doesn't it?

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, the human side
does have like headdress

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:90%
that would look very Egyptian.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%
But also, the Olmec.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:84%
The early Olmec also wore
very similar headdress

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:90%
that you find with the--

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Also,
isn't it interesting

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
that Cairo, which is, of
course, the capital of Egypt,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:90%
means Mars in Arabic.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, there is a very
interesting correlation between

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:84%
the two cultures with the
Mesoamerican especially--

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.176 align:middle line:90%
Olmec and Egypt.

00:02:08.176 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you began
to research this,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:90%
what were your first steps?

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in that?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, like
I said early on,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.330 align:middle line:84%
my interest began with
the Viking Landers,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.084 align:middle line:84%
and that was the Bicentennial
year in the United States.

00:02:22.084 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the year I graduated
high school, a good part

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:90%
of the Bicentennial class.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of patriotism
and things like that.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And the landing of
the Mars probes on--

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:90%
the Viking--

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
always so exciting.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.655 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Oh, yeah, it
was very exciting.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.439 align:middle line:84%
But after NASA came out and
said that the face was just

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.230 align:middle line:84%
a trick of light and
nothing to worry about

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and they took more
pictures of it.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a
mesa or something.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.356 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, it
was just nothing.

00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So my interest kind of
waned until, I guess,

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
around 1992 when Mars Orbiter
was going to be sent up--

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
the one that disappeared just
before it reached the planet--

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and that's when my
interest began again.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't get
any confirmation

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:84%
for the face on Mars until
the Mars Global Surveyor

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
image in 1998 took
the better picture.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The better
picture or the picture

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that NASA used to try to
convince us it wasn't a face?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Well, that's true.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.023 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I
disappointed with that picture.

00:03:14.023 --> 00:03:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, what NASA did
originally with the 1998 image,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.814 align:middle line:84%
Richard Hoagland was involved in
that, and he got a lot of blame

00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:22.230 align:middle line:84%
for what happened
with that image,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.944 align:middle line:84%
because he was
out saying that we

00:03:23.944 --> 00:03:25.860 align:middle line:84%
want NASA to release the
goods as soon as they

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:90%
get the picture.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't be messing around with
any kind of enhancement.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:84%
They want to see
the original image.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So NASA took advantage of that,
and they took the raw data

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.207 align:middle line:84%
and they released
it to the public.

00:03:35.207 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:90%
And it was on in the newspapers.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.998 align:middle line:84%
It was a stretched out-- it
didn't even look like anything.

00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:40.379 align:middle line:90%
It was an awful picture.

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the case
was closed to the public.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
They thought that that
was what it looked like.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was it.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:90%
It was over.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.391 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: However, if
you, at the time,

00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
in 1998, not many people
had access to computers.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
If you were able to go
onto the NASA website.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
They had it rectified
image of the face on Mars

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:84%
which was in the
proper orientation.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which they
didn't show us.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.696 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, the
interesting thing

00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:84%
was that the pictures
of the face on Mars,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
normally, right
next to the face,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
there's a circular crater which
is convenient for orientation

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.460 align:middle line:90%
and to get perspective.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.389 align:middle line:84%
Now, all the images
of the 1998 image

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that were released to
the press, especially

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:84%
"New York Times," the
stretched out image, they

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:90%
cropped off the crater.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
Because if the crater
was in the picture,

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
you'd see that the
crater was not round,

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
it was all stretched
out, which would give you

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
a clue that something was
wrong with this picture.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they did
the rectification

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and they straightened
the image out,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.045 align:middle line:84%
which was silently
released on their website,

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:84%
it was a whole
different picture.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look
at the picture of Mars,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:90%
what does it show you?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It looks like a
dead planet at this point.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's just nothing
but this red dust everywhere

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.656 align:middle line:84%
and weird structures and
formations all over the planet.

00:04:44.656 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:10%
No signs of water that
we could see visually,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:10%
but NASA has taken
pictures showing

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:10%
there is some water seepage
in some craters and things.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But it overall looks
like a dead planet.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.741 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
happened to the planet?

00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:90%

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:90%

side of the brain

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
instead of the academic
looking at something.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But looking at the
planet, there's

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of interesting geological
features on the planet--

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:90%
the face on Mars.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And then that whole
area of Cydonia,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
there have been researchers that
claim that there's structures,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.124 align:middle line:84%
the five-sided D&M pyramid is
right next to the face on Mars.

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of evidence early

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
on showing that looks like
a lot of structure up there.

>>NOORY: John Brandenburg
is a great researcher,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and I had an opportunity

something past, right?

00:05:39.886 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:10%
>>BRANDENBURG: Right.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
There are two lines now of
intelligent activity on Mars.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
One is what looks like
eroded archeology dating

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:84%
from a earth-like
period on Mars.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
We found remnants of this
at Cydonia Mensae, the face

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:90%
and the pyramid--

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.810 align:middle line:90%
the D&M pyramid.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Also at another place
called Galaxias Chaos,

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.685 align:middle line:90%
which I, myself, discovered.

00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:02.759 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: And
there apparently are two

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:84%
faces there, one of which looks
just like the face at Cydonia.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:90%
It's just smaller.

>>NOORY: If this happened, John,
when do you think it occurred?

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It
looks like it dates

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:84%
from the time when Mars had
an ocean and was earth-like.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.569 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Billions of years ago?

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: No,
probably about a quarter

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:90%
billion years ago.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is nothing
in the scheme of time.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Geologic
time, quite recently.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned,
there are two lines

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.140 align:middle line:84%
of evidence for
intelligent activity.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
One is the
archaeological remnants.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.530 align:middle line:84%
What appear to be
archaeological remnants.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The other one is the evidence
for massive nuclear explosions

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.526 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of his work, George?

00:06:42.526 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I'm friends
with Dr. Brandenburg.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I think he's made some
very important discoveries.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
He's had, I think, two science
papers about this discovery,

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
about this nuclear
explosion-- one over Cydonia

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and the other one on the other
side of the planet over Utopia.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And using NASA's
own data, early on,

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
from what Dr.
Brandenburg states,

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
that NASA was aware of
this all back to the Viking

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
because the orbiters
had sensors onboard,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and they were able to pick up
a lot of this these isotopes

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:90%
that he's talking about.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And these isotope signatures
are not natural radiation,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
it's a artificial
type of radiation

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:84%
that was created which
these signatures show.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:84%
It shows that these
were weaponized.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's mind boggling to
try to ascertain what happened

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:90%
to Mars many, many years ago.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:84%
It must have been a horrible,
frightening experience

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.795 align:middle line:84%
if there was anybody
living on that planet.

00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, from what we're
seeing it appears that NASA--

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
through their data, with their
images-- what we're seeing

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
is that, like Dr. Brandenburg
says, Mars, at one time,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.540 align:middle line:84%
was probably a very green
planet-- had water, had life.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we know it
had water, a lot of water.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And either through
some indigenous battle

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.036 align:middle line:84%
or where these nuclear
battles went on,

00:07:57.036 --> 00:07:58.160 align:middle line:90%
they destroyed the culture.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.635 align:middle line:84%
Possibly, leaving Mars
and coming to earth.

00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
people believe that,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:90%
that we may be the Martians.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, the structures
that we're finding on Mars--

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and most particularly this
three-sided pyramid that we

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.816 align:middle line:90%
found--

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:84%
shows a lot of connections
to terrestrial cultures.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.481 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take a look
at that three-sided pyramid,

00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:84%
George, and you can just tell
us what we're looking at here.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, this is
a three-sided pyramid

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that is located in the Candor
Chasm area of Mars which

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:90%
is in the Western hemisphere.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see,
this is a very exquisite

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:90%
three-dimensional structure.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great picture.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, this is early
Mars Global Surveyor images.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And you can see the three faces.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
They're perfectly
divided into three faces

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
which are 120 degrees each,
which adds up the 360 degrees.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
The exquisite geometry-- and
this is just mind-blowing--

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and this is on the
surface of Mars.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And NASA's taken numerous
pictures of this.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can that
happen naturally?

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.055 align:middle line:90%
That shape?

00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: We had a science paper
published that we were working

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
with this, and we
had two geologists--

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:84%
a close friend of mine, William
Saunders and Michael Dale,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:84%
a geologist-- and they're
saying that there's

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:84%
no way something like this
could be produced naturally.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Even if you look at the sand
dunes and the wind directions

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.105 align:middle line:84%
and things, they
just don't add up.

00:09:14.105 --> 00:09:15.688 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I was
going to ask you,

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
what is that
irrigation-looking mark

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:90%
leading up to the pyramids?

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Those are sand dunes.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, if you're
looking at wind directions,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:84%
if the sand dunes were
created in the lower

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
portion, those straight
striations going down,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that would eliminate the
ones on the upper left

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:84%
because they're all going
in a different direction.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Something even as
simple as looking

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:84%
at the sand dunes
in this area don't

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.867 align:middle line:90%
make any sense geologically.

00:09:38.867 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
interesting because if you

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.469 align:middle line:84%
look at the Great Pyramids
of Giza from above,

00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:44.510 align:middle line:90%
they look just like that.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Oh, yeah, except
they'd be four-sided.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Three-sided pyramids
are very rare on Earth.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.399 align:middle line:84%
Besides this one,
there's numerous examples

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:84%
of three-sided pyramids
that we're finding.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
the next picture which

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.295 align:middle line:90%
is a different angle of this.

00:09:58.295 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: This is the
most recent picture

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:90%
of this three-sided pyramid.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
This was taken by the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter--

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:90%
very high resolution--

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.831 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --which
shows a lot of detail

00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
on the left side,
that shiny face.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.572 align:middle line:10%
You can actually see what
appears to be a construction.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If this was man-made
or made by something,

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.607 align:middle line:84%
somebody, how would
they have made that?

00:10:22.607 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:10%
And how big is that?

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Well, like
the American Indians,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.005 align:middle line:10%
we have earthen mounds.

00:10:28.005 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, we don't know if this
is an earthen mound that

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.185 align:middle line:10%
was covered with masonry.

00:10:33.185 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:10%
But from looking at these
high-resolution pictures,

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:10%
there appears to be some
masonry on that left side.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:10%
And one way to really
get to the crux of this

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:10%
is to show this evidence
and get NASA to get

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:10%
some boots on the ground.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this thing.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.486 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
size of that object?

00:10:47.486 --> 00:10:52.585 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: This is about 1,000 feet
across and about 450 feet high.

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.717 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would that
echo the pyramids of Giza?

00:10:55.717 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: It's a lot bigger.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.836 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it?

00:10:57.836 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the next one.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.295 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Now, this image here
is showing the recent picture

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:10%
of the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter on the left--

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:10%
a crop of that.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's showing the
exquisite geometry

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:90%
that the geologist saw on this.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:10%
Now, this pyramid doesn't
have straight sides

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:10%
like we would see at the
Giza Pyramids in Egypt.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
These have a circular
structure to it.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.450 align:middle line:10%
And if you do this very
intricate rolo geometry

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:10%
with the three circles
intersecting, I mean,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.455 align:middle line:10%
this is high art.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:84%
This is, you know, master
building that we're looking at.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This looks more like
a structure that was physically

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:10%
there, that they played with.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't it?

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.546 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Possibly.

00:11:39.546 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:10%
But there are other structures
in this area that we won't

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:10%
have time to talk about
today, but this is not

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.874 align:middle line:10%
an isolated event.

00:11:45.874 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:10%
There's other
structures in this--

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.087 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Similar to this?

00:11:49.087 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: More pictographic.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.006 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, and let's look at
our last picture here, George.

00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, this is
an image showing--

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
comparison, right?

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yep, right.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
The object on the right is
the only three-sided pyramid

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:90%
on Earth that we could find.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is a man-made
structure that is--

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the audience
will enjoy this--

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:90%
this is found in Area 51.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Made-made?

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.317 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: This is man-made.

00:12:13.317 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the
structure's used for.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.680 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:90%
You can see it on the internet.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:90%
That's where we found the image.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:90%
And this is located at Area 51.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a three-sided
pyramidal structure.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What looks like
chipped out of there at the top?

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: The top-- it's
a flat base at the top.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be an
access cap on the top,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.006 align:middle line:84%
and there's two little ports on
the left and the right there.

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And then off the top,
that band going across,

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:84%
that's a road, so you can
get a good idea of the size.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
But we just put
this side by side

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:84%
to show you the exquisite
geometry that we're

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
seeing in the image on Mars is
even more startling than what

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:90%
we're seeing--

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's so amazing about
this is that the anomalies are

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
everywhere on this
planet, not just situated

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:90%
at Cydonia in areas like this.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, we're finding
these structures are

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%
planet-wide on Mars.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's early
interest in Mars

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:84%
was with Cydonia
because of the face

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, the D&M pyramid of
the so-called "city area."

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And once NASA started
taking all these pictures--

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and there's a tremendous
archive to look through,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and it's very time consuming.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.181 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the average
citizen would

00:13:23.181 --> 00:13:25.180 align:middle line:10%
take weeks and weeks for
them to even figure out

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:10%
how to access these images.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But once you do, you have
access to all of this--

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:84%
the catalog that they have--
from the Viking, the Mars

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Global Surveyor,
the THEMIS images.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can do comparisons to
show, like, the pyramid here,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:90%
the three-sided pyramid.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:84%
There's five or six
images of this formation

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that are taken at different
sunlight, different times

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:90%
of the year.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So it shows that the
formation is consistent.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would the
purpose be of that pyramid,

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.142 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:13:54.142 --> 00:13:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: The culture that
built it, it's probably

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:90%
some type of huge complex.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
There's probably all
kinds of archives inside.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And like I said
earlier, there's also

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:84%
other structures around that
that point to artificiality.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.215 align:middle line:84%
So these are probably
just small little cities.

00:14:10.215 --> 00:14:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we send astronauts
to Mars, whenever this occurs,

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.424 align:middle line:84%
where should we go
first in your opinion?

00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, a
lot of people want

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
them to go to Cydonia because
we're all familiar with that,

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:84%
but there's so many other
places on the planet to go to.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:90%
That would be a hard choice.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.707 align:middle line:84%
But if you pressed me for
an answer, I'd probably say,

00:14:29.707 --> 00:14:31.290 align:middle line:84%
go to the face on
Mars because I think

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:84%
once the public's convinced
that that's a structure,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:90%
then the whole ball game is--

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And why does NASA,
George, seem to hold back?

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, don't you think
this would be an amazing

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
announcement if NASA said,
we believe this structure--

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:90%
this face on Mars--

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:84%
was built by a civilization
on that planet.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
happened to them.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if they
came here, but we

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
do believe that this was
created by intelligent beings.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Why not just say that?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, I think they
have a lot of reasons not

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:90%
One is control.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to intimidate
other cultures that

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
have drastically different
beliefs about things.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And they have to deal with
the whole planet, I think.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And it is a odd question
of why they don't even

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.886 align:middle line:84%
consider acknowledging
that this is a structure.

00:15:25.886 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
even black and white.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just no, no, no.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, they said no,
no about water until recently.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.046 align:middle line:84%
Now they're saying they
found a lake on Mars.

00:15:34.046 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's true.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: It takes time.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.330 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
the significance

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:84%
of these structures might be--
the pyramids, the face, things

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Is that for others looking
down, or is it just for them?

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, just like we
find on Earth with pictographic

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:90%
structures--

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:84%
specifically in
Peru-- what we find

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of these
ancient cultures,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.195 align:middle line:84%
they'll build these
huge geoglyphs

00:16:00.195 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
which is a pictographic
graphic image of something.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.677 align:middle line:84%
So if you're flying over,
like the Nazca Lines,

00:16:04.677 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:90%
it's like, oh, looky here.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.741 align:middle line:90%
What is here?

00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you come and
investigate that area,

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:84%
you'll find out
in that vicinity,

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:90%
there's a whole culture.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And we think that what
we're finding on Mars

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
is seeing something
like the face on Mars,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.802 align:middle line:90%
something we can recognize.

00:16:17.802 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
there, you're going

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:90%
to find there's the D&M pyramid.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:90%
There's a city complex.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.890 align:middle line:84%
There's this whole
cities in this area.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with
what we're going

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:90%
to be talking about later--

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:84%
the parrot geoglyph-- is
right next to a whole city.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think this idea
of using geoglyphs

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:84%
draws the eye in,
culture center, you know,

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.332 align:middle line:84%
flying over the
planet, looking down

00:16:37.332 --> 00:16:38.790 align:middle line:84%
because all of
these structures are

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:84%
built for flying over the
terrain to see these things.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.944 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It truly is
remarkable, isn't it?

00:16:45.944 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, a lot
of scientists contend

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.475 align:middle line:84%
that that was just
the ancient cultures

00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:50.975 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate
with the gods.

00:16:50.975 --> 00:16:52.349 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
which is possible.

00:16:52.349 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Which is possible.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's also plausible
that they were

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.955 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate with--

00:16:56.955 --> 00:16:59.040 align:middle line:84%
as the ancient
aliens likes to say--

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.840 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.814 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
some more structures.

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:04.980 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, this is
the keyhole structure.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:84%
We had a science paper
published for this also.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do you
mean the keyhole structure?

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It's shaped
like a keyhole.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:90%
It has the circle on the bottom.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
an exclamation mark.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
Now, when this was taken, this
is a high-resolution image

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
taken by the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter,

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:84%
and NASA releases images
constantly, every month.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And normally, when
they put up an image,

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:90%
they don't have any caption.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.111 align:middle line:84%
It's just the data
and the images there.

00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:84%
When they put this
image up, they actually

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
said it looked like
an exclamation mark.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they had
three paragraphs

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.375 align:middle line:84%
from one of the NASA scientists
saying why this was natural.

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It looks natural to me.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:90%
What about you?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, from
my perspective,

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:84%
it is one of the strongest
pieces of evidence we have.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:84%
The symmetry in
this is remarkable--

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: --the geometry.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Point that out to me.

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: The symmetry
and the geometry

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:10%
that we're seeing in
this keyhole formation.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.680 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, everything
is equal on each side.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:90%
This symmetry's remarkable.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
The mathematical
alignment of this

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:84%
is beyond anything that
you could find naturally.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.569 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which drawing is the
structure and what is the--

00:18:11.569 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: The one on the left
is actually just an outline

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:90%
of the structure.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
The dome, the
circular part is not

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.395 align:middle line:90%
connected to the bar at the top.

00:18:21.395 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing
here, we're just

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
showing the triangular
symmetry, that everything just

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
connects to the center.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And this was all looked
at by the two geologists

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:90%
that co-wrote the paper.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And we think this is
just beyond belief.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if you were
to mathematically project

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
the odds of this
happening naturally,

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.639 align:middle line:90%
what would those odds be?

00:18:46.639 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Well, we haven't had
that calculation prepared,

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:10%
but it would be astronomical.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.455 align:middle line:10%
The geologist that
looked at this, there's

00:18:54.455 --> 00:18:56.955 align:middle line:10%
no way that something like this
could be produced naturally.

00:18:56.955 --> 00:18:57.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:18:57.755 --> 00:18:59.829 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And this is out
in the middle of nowhere.

00:18:59.829 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:90%
This is isolated all by itself.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.950 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing around this.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing around it.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
What could have been
around it, water?

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It seems to be in
the middle of a big plain.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there--

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing there.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.618 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's look at
our last picture.

00:19:09.618 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --except
this unique piece.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is giving the
audience a perspective

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.370 align:middle line:84%
of showing a terrestrial
example of a keyhole tomb

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:90%
with the keyhole on Mars.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the image on the left is of
the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:84%
image showing the
arrow view, obviously,

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:90%
of the keyhole formation.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the right side, that
is a Kofun tomb in Japan

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.330 align:middle line:90%
which is over 2000 years old.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, the
comparison of the formations

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:90%
are remarkable.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is very similar.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you're seeing
similar objects on Earth,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and you see them on Mars, what
do you conclude about that?

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: We're
concluding that whoever

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
built these structures on Mars
have a direct relationship

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.365 align:middle line:90%
with terrestrial cultures.

00:19:56.365 --> 00:19:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And the interesting
thing about this keyhole shape.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:90%
This is a universal form.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.980 align:middle line:90%
This isn't only in Japan.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:84%
We find this in
American Indians.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
They produce mounds that
are shaped like this.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists
call them war clubs

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:90%
instead of keyhole formations.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.240 align:middle line:10%
They're found in Saudi Arabia.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.656 align:middle line:84%
If you go on the
internet, there's

00:20:14.656 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:84%
aerial views of these
tombs all over the place.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
These tombs here, the one we're
showing on the comparison,

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:90%
that's in Japan.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:84%
These are all over
in Japan and one

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:90%
of the areas of the country.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And pictographically,
you find it

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
with hieroglyphics in
the Mesoamerican culture.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:90%
They used a keyhole shape.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Even the Egyptians.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So this goes all the way
back to the Knights Templar.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
In England, one of the oldest
churches that the Knights

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Templar built, the only
thing left of the church

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation, and
it's shaped like a keyhole.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the significance

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:90%
of a keyhole shape?

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, it has to
do a lot with geometry.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the two opposing
of the circle,

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.603 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the
triangle intersecting.

00:20:55.603 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
significance of the keyhole

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.061 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the imagery?

00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, the keyhole,
a lot of people think of it

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
because it's where you
put the key to the door--

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:06.783 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: The keyhole.

00:21:06.783 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually a
very ancient shape.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I think even the St.
Patrick's Cathedral

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:90%
has some reference to that.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of spiritual
connection to these two

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:90%
objects.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
The sphere and the
triangle going together

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
may have something to
do with reproduction.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.739 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot of esoteric--

00:21:29.739 --> 00:21:31.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there is
a lot of symbolism.

00:21:31.405 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: A lot of symbolism.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's truly remarkable.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And you find these
all over the planet?

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, that's
the remarkable thing.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:84%
When we first got introduced to
this whole idea of structures

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, everyone thought
it was just in Cydonia

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and that the rest of the planet
was just a bunch of rocks.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And as people started examining
different areas of the planet,

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.640 align:middle line:84%
we found, hey, look at
there's stuff everywhere.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your opinion--

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:90%
we touched on it briefly--

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:84%
do you think Mars was disrupted
by some kind of nuclear war,

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe from extraterrestrials
from outside of Mars?

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Or that there was some
calamity that occurred,

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:90%
that it got hit by an asteroid.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But the planet doesn't
look like it was bombarded

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:90%
by something that destroyed it.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't see that, do you?

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, there's
a few scenarios.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
My personal belief is that
Mars evolved as a green planet

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.385 align:middle line:90%
and had oceans and water--

00:22:30.385 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Atmosphere--

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:31.965 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: --atmosphere.

00:22:31.965 --> 00:22:32.881 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --everything.

00:22:32.881 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And there was
some natural catastrophe

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.217 align:middle line:84%
that happened that
destroyed the planet.

00:22:37.217 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think the objects
that we're finding--

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:84%
this architecture,
these buildings,

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and these pictographs
and images--

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.885 align:middle line:84%
those were built by a different
culture that came and occupied

00:22:45.885 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:90%
the dead planet.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.815 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I believe
these things were all

00:22:48.815 --> 00:22:52.470 align:middle line:84%
built on the planet,
constructed on Mars when dead.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And that culture was
destroyed by either

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:84%
a conflicting culture, an
extraterrestrial culture,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.536 align:middle line:90%
or infighting.

00:23:01.536 --> 00:23:05.515 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would they want
to occupy a dead planet?

00:23:05.515 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, it's
easy to move around.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything on Mars is large,
and some of these things

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.910 align:middle line:90%
are over a mile and a--

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:84%
the keyhole formation is
a mile and a half long.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And with the low gravity, and
there's just a lot of room

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:90%
to build stuff.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to
do off planet, you

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.237 align:middle line:84%
know, your ships
coming back and forth.

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with the moon--

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:84%
less gravity, better place
to build a space base

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
where you could get
off the planet easier.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem
we have on Earth is

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.069 align:middle line:90%
getting on and off the planet.

00:23:35.069 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes you
think these structures came

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:90%
after the fact?

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Because of
their condition.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.706 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these are in
really pristine shape

00:23:42.706 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that we're finding,
at least some

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:90%
of these pictographic images.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
should've been more--

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:46.840 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: They would
have been destroyed.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.335 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason
that they're preserved

00:23:50.335 --> 00:23:54.550 align:middle line:84%
is because there's less
weathering on Mars.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:58.120 align:middle line:84%
The wind on Mars gets
around 15 miles an hour.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I know the public sees a lot
of these movies about Mars

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:90%
with these huge--

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dust storms.

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --storms coming
and pulling people apart.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.339 align:middle line:84%
The wind gets no faster
than 15 miles an hour--

00:24:07.339 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:90%
these little dust storms.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.921 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
convinced that there

00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
was an advanced
civilization on Mars?

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I believe an advanced
civilization occupied Mars.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
were indigenous,

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.823 align:middle line:84%
but I know there was
some advance-- that had

00:24:18.823 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:90%
a direct correlation with us.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot
of evidence that when

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Earth had humans living on it,
the opposing group was living

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:90%
on Mars a millennial ago.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By the looks of things,
how long were they there?

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, according to
my co-author William Saunders

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and Michael Dale,
the other geologist,

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.420 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking that some
of the structures on Mars--

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and going along with the
history that's connecting this

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:90%
to Mesoamerica--

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:90%
that it's anywhere between--

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.956 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be
interesting-- between 25,000

00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:90%
and 250,000 years.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:52.973 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: That recent.

00:24:52.973 --> 00:24:55.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's recent,
but not for a long time.

00:24:55.575 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:84%
They didn't stay
for a long time.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: We don't know where they
went or if they're still here.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
That may be the
culture that people

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:84%
are saying about UFOs
and aliens and the Greys.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:84%
They may be connected to
whoever that was then.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
they've decided

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to take a standoffish
point as opposed

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:84%
to being more interactive that
they were in the earlier times,

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.262 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the theory
that we're the Martians?

00:25:18.262 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, we
may be genetically

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:84%
connected to them, whoever
made us, probably from Mars.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow Zacharias
Sitchin with the Anunnaki,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki are also
connected to Mesoamerica

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.250 align:middle line:90%
with the Olmec, the same idea.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.221 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
connections with all this

00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:90%
once you get involved into it.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if the Anunnaki
was responsible for seeding

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:90%
the entire solar system?

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: That's correct.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.497 align:middle line:84%
Our solar system may not be
the only place they visited.

00:25:48.497 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:84%
They could be doing
this all over the place.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's something else.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've got
the keyhole, the face.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Do they tie in together at all?

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, just
that their structures

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:84%
on Mars probably dating
to the same period.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
fascinating pieces we have

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.191 align:middle line:90%
is the parrot formation.

00:26:05.191 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, tell me
about the parrot formation

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.840 align:middle line:84%
before we look at
some of the pictures.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, the
parrot formation

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.800 align:middle line:84%
was found by a early member
of the Cydonia Institute, Will

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Faust, and it is over a
mile long or nearly a mile.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It's a profiled
image of a parrot.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:90%
And it has the head, the body.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.400 align:middle line:84%
It's got a leg with
some feet, the toes.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:90%
It's got tail feathers.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It's got a raised
up wing, and you

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
can see the wing frets in
the feathering in the wing.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:84%
The details so precise
that you can actually

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.521 align:middle line:90%
see the tongue inside the beak.

00:26:41.521 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
the significance

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.582 align:middle line:84%
be of building a
parrot structure?

00:26:44.582 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Well, the interesting
thing about a parrot with all

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.980 align:middle line:10%
of this Mesoamerican imagery
that we're finding on Mars--

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:10%
going right back to
the face on Mars,

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:10%
had a lot of Mesoamerican
iconography in there--

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.455 align:middle line:10%
the parrot was the principal
bird deity of the Maya.

00:26:58.455 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Oh, yeah.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:01.275 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Which was a macaw.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And the principal bird deity,
according to the Popol Vuh,

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:84%
he was one of the bird gods
of the early Maya culture.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And similar to the
American Indian story

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.200 align:middle line:84%
where the crow steals the
sun, puts it in a box.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the principal
bird deity, the macaw--

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Seven Macaw, he's
actually called--

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.830 align:middle line:90%
he had stolen the sun.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And the Hero Twins had to kill
the parrot to get the sun back.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.197 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
Mesoamerica pots and stelae

00:27:35.197 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and things talking about the
Hero Twins, the famous Hero

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Twins from the Maya creation
story that they shot a dart,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and they hit the
beak of the parrot,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.449 align:middle line:84%
and he fell out
of the world tree,

00:27:46.449 --> 00:27:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they
retrieved the sun back.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's look
at this picture, then.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.726 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:27:51.726 --> 00:27:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, here's two images
of the parrot formation.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.870 align:middle line:84%
The same image, just
the one on the bottom

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:02.080 align:middle line:84%
it's colorized just to
give the audience a time

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
to adjust their eye to see
what they're looking at here.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the profiled
image of this parrot.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:84%
It's about almost
a mile in length.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:84%
You can see it has a
circular mound that's

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.120 align:middle line:90%
the main part of the body.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.140 align:middle line:90%
There's the head.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.320 align:middle line:84%
There's the tufting around
the feathering of the neck.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.700 align:middle line:90%
You can see the eye, the beak.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:90%
There's a tongue feature.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:84%
The lower leg is there with
the elbow and the toes.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:84%
You can see some tail
feathers coming off.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.150 align:middle line:84%
This was one of the early
Mars Global Surveyor images.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It didn't capture
the entire tail,

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.050 align:middle line:84%
but we did get two
other images later

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:90%
on that confirmed all that.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the wing
frets coming up over the back.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And way above this, which
is not in this image,

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.520 align:middle line:84%
you can see there's the
wing goes all the way up.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.207 align:middle line:84%
And the odd thing
about this, once you're

00:28:45.207 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:84%
looking at it, if you look
at the colorized image,

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
you can see there's a dart
sticking out of his beak.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Now that goes right back
to the principal bird deity

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:84%
story of Mesoamerica
where the Hero Twins,

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
to retrieve the sun,
they shot the macaw

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:84%
with a dart that hit him in
the beak, and he fell down.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, this parrot on Mars looks
like he's down on the ground.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a dead parrot.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He looks dead.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And even he has his eyes
like a little slit there.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And his wing is up like
a he's an injured bird.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
little feathered things

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.460 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the picture?

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: The little
squiggly lines?

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.046 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The squiggly lines.

00:29:20.046 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Those are
sand dunes that are

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.920 align:middle line:90%
in that part of the picture.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Those are just little dunes.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:84%
As you can see,
underneath the parrot,

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:84%
that nice brown area there with
that little streak running.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:90%
That's all sand.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And the foot at the
bottom is partially

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.340 align:middle line:90%
covered by some of that sand.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is located in the
Argyre basin area of Mars which

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.610 align:middle line:90%
is directly below Cydonia.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big are
those sand dunes, though?

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:84%
If you were standing up between
them, how tall would they be?

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Oh, those are huge.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know because
that's a small detail.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:84%
When you consider that from
the beak to the end of the tail

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:84%
is almost a mile, so
those are pretty--

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
could be hundreds

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.767 align:middle line:90%
of feet tall, of sand dunes.

00:30:03.767 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: That's true.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.016 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing, George,

00:30:06.016 --> 00:30:08.500 align:middle line:84%
is that over the years, all
of the different images,

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:84%
the sand dunes are
the same shape.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.694 align:middle line:84%
They don't move, or they
don't change shape with wind,

00:30:14.694 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:90%
so it's very peculiar.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they petrified?

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.487 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: We don't know.

00:30:17.487 --> 00:30:19.570 align:middle line:84%
It'd be great to go there
and take a look at them.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.040 align:middle line:90%
But as you know, sand moves.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%
You know, wind moves

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: But the interesting
thing even with the--

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:84%
as we showed the first image
with the three-sided pyramid,

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
those weird looking sand
dunes that come off each side,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.035 align:middle line:90%
they are consistent over--

00:30:32.035 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't change.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: --years.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.057 align:middle line:84%
In different seasons,
they do not change.

00:30:36.057 --> 00:30:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And you would think
sand dunes would change.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost
like they're solidified.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, it's like
they're frozen in time.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at our next picture.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.980 align:middle line:84%
There's the parrot
again on the bottom.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.081 align:middle line:84%
This looks more like a
parrot than the close-up.

00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, this gives
you a whole perspective.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have a
parrot at the bottom,

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and then you see
the wing going up.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.040 align:middle line:10%
Now, all of this grid-like
structure above the parrot,

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.290 align:middle line:10%
this is what we were talking
about earlier about a lot

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.340 align:middle line:10%
of these South American
cultures putting a pictograph

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:10%
of an animal next--

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:10%
which is usually
shaped in the ground

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.120 align:middle line:10%
next to their city to show
people flying over that hey,

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.830 align:middle line:10%
look here, there
might be a city.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
This whole wing section
above the parrot

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:84%
has all kinds of
structures in it

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.430 align:middle line:84%
which we won't have time to
talk about today but maybe

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:21.870 align:middle line:90%
in a future program.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:26.565 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing the structures
that are up in that wing.

00:31:26.565 --> 00:31:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There looks like a
hodgepodge of things up there.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: If you follow the image
straight up to the center top,

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:84%
there's that odd
grape structure.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Do you see that?

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.087 align:middle line:84%
Was called "the scarab"
early on in our research.

00:31:40.087 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And just looking at
the infrastructure

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:84%
next to that with
that grid going up,

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.630 align:middle line:84%
this is all you know
ruined structures.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That looks like a
huge city complex, doesn't it?

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Exactly.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So you asked
earlier, which place

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:90%
would I'd rather go to on Mars.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.384 align:middle line:84%
This is probably the top
three that I'd want to go--

00:31:56.384 --> 00:31:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you
think the parrot was

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:02.706 align:middle line:84%
a natural impression, and
then they modified it?

00:32:02.706 --> 00:32:03.580 align:middle line:90%
There was already a--

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:03.840 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: The sphinx, supposedly,
was a natural formation

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:90%
that they modified.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:90%
This could have been.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But the amount of detail that
was put into this modification.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.570 align:middle line:84%
This parrot was examined
by two geologists and three

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:90%
veterinarians.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
One veterinarian,
a Avian specialist.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does she say?

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: She says that
this parrot formation--

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:84%
along with the other
two veterinarians--

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:30.180 align:middle line:84%
is exquisite in its design
and has over 17 points

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:90%
of anatomical correctness.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's talking about the
beak, the tongue, the eye,

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.917 align:middle line:84%
the neck, the body,
the legs, the wings.

00:32:36.917 --> 00:32:37.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The headdress?

00:32:37.875 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, there's 17 points
of anatomical correctness.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're looking
at something that's

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be
natural, and you're

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:84%
trying to have an argument
that it's artificial,

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:84%
after you get past five points
of anatomical correctness,

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.350 align:middle line:84%
it's starting to
look artificial.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:90%
This formation has 17.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm impressed with
the feathered bottom look

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.335 align:middle line:90%
of the parrot.

00:32:58.335 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Oh, yes.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And later images actually
show more of the tail.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
one more image here.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: What we're looking at
now is a terrestrial image--

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
an aerial view of the earliest
Maya city that was found.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.580 align:middle line:90%
This is in Guatemala.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:90%
This is called Utatlán.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, named from
the K'iche' Maya

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.400 align:middle line:84%
was the "place of reeds" which
is mentioned in the Maya Popol

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Vuh.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:84%
This is one of
the oldest cities.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.750 align:middle line:84%
This city was excavated in
1970 by archaeologist William

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Wallace.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And on the right, you'll
see his sight map.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was found to have the
shape of a parrot with its wing

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.860 align:middle line:90%
So you can see the parrots head.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.000 align:middle line:84%
There's the wing up, and
there's the tail feathers.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So the whole shape of one of the
earliest K'iche' Maya cities is

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:84%
in the shape of a parrot just
like we're finding on Mars.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And the parrot is
the Seven Macaw

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.140 align:middle line:84%
which was the principal bird
deity in the Maya culture.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty
extraordinary that we're

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:90%
finding the same shape on Mars.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And not only is this whole
parrot shape part of a city--

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:90%
the city is in that shape--

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.780 align:middle line:84%
we're finding
evidence of a city up

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.550 align:middle line:84%
in the wing of the
parrot on Mars.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people look at
the structure of the parrot,

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:15.095 align:middle line:84%
do they all come up with
the same conclusion?

00:34:15.095 --> 00:34:15.895 align:middle line:90%
Different people?

00:34:15.895 --> 00:34:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: You're talking
about the one on Earth here?

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:18.751 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The one on Mars.

00:34:18.751 --> 00:34:21.229 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Everyone we've
shown, they see the parrot.

00:34:21.229 --> 00:34:22.029 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:34:22.029 --> 00:34:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Oh, yeah.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.564 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
odds of that happening?

00:34:24.564 --> 00:34:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, when Will Faust
found this, he first noticed--

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:84%
days before he realized he
was looking at a parrot--

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:84%
he was interested in
the wing formation--

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.239 align:middle line:90%
all that structure up there.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Because Will was a--

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.810 align:middle line:84%
his background
was in archeology.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:38.931 align:middle line:90%
He lived in Pennsylvania.

00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:39.889 align:middle line:90%
He's no longer with us.

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:44.860 align:middle line:84%
He passed away while we
were writing this paper.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Will Faust found
the parrot on Mars.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.165 align:middle line:84%
He also found the three-sided
pyramid in Candor chasm.

00:34:50.165 --> 00:34:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
our last picture here.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.779 align:middle line:90%
So what are we looking at here?

00:34:54.779 --> 00:34:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: This is a close-up
of the wing section.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the upper and right,
that grape-shaped formation

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:84%
that we call the scarab
up on the right side, just

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.160 align:middle line:84%
look at the
infrastructure there.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is amazing.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.980 align:middle line:84%
There's structures
everywhere here.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm still fascinated
by these sand dunes.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.725 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, and there you
can see the sand dunes coming

00:35:13.725 --> 00:35:16.150 align:middle line:90%
down there on the left side.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And like I had said
earlier, they all

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.510 align:middle line:84%
seem to be consistent when we
take newer images of these.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.970 align:middle line:84%
The sand dunes are still
there, the same shape.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:26.230 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of bizarre.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truly, it looks like
a city with roads, doesn't it?

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: It does.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have higher resolution
pictures of this available--

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:38.020 align:middle line:84%
not this slide-- and
some of the details

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.990 align:middle line:90%
are just also, pretty amazing.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And if this was found
on Earth, there'd

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.670 align:middle line:84%
be no question that this
was a lost civilization.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, there's no
question about it.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: This is
the parrot aside.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.068 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is right
next to the parrot.

00:35:51.068 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
these lines that I

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.240 align:middle line:90%
think look like roads to you?

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It does look like
a gridwork of a major city

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.820 align:middle line:90%
with the central hubs.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:05.110 align:middle line:84%
It looks like an ancient city
with roadways and connective

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:84%
tunneling and all
kinds of bridges--

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:12.190 align:middle line:84%
collapsed bridges up on
the top, open foundations.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, something
dramatic happened here

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:90%
to cause these ruins.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
these real dark spots?

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They look like they could have
been lake basins or something.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: The dark spots
are basically just shadows

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.930 align:middle line:90%
showing the height.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:29.200 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
scarab form, which

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:84%
looks kind of like a
grape, to the left of that

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.350 align:middle line:90%
is a major bridge that goes up.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:39.355 align:middle line:84%
So that shadowing is probably
showing how high up that is.

00:36:39.355 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you look to the
left, you can actually

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:84%
see all the infrastructure
of buildings shooting up

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:44.980 align:middle line:90%
on the side there.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of supportive beams
and things throughout this.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:50.555 align:middle line:90%
It just reeks of artificiality.

00:36:50.555 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our Mars rovers have
taken some incredible pictures.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.921 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:36:55.921 --> 00:36:59.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Mars and Earth have
approximately the same landmass

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.650 align:middle line:10%
even though Mars has only
15% of the Earth's volume

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.620 align:middle line:10%
and just over 10%
of the Earth's mass.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Around 2/3 of the Earth's
surface is covered in water.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Martian surface gravity's
only 37% of ours,

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:84%
meaning you could leap nearly
three times higher on Mars.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Mars is home to the tallest
mountain in the solar system--

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Olympus Mons-- a shield volcano
that's 21 kilometers high

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.930 align:middle line:90%
and 600 kilometers in diameter.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:31.930 align:middle line:10%
Despite having formed
over billions of years,

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.090 align:middle line:10%
evidence from volcanic
lava is so recent

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:10%
that many scientists believe
it could still be alive.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.300 align:middle line:10%
Recent photos captured
by the Mars Spirit Rover

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.430 align:middle line:10%
shows what appears to
be bird-like object

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.770 align:middle line:10%
in the sky of Mars.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics said that
perhaps it's something

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.540 align:middle line:90%
on the lens of the camera.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:84%
However, some believe
it could show an animal.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:84%
The mysterious bird-like
creature flying past the sky

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:84%
could be a number
of things, and it's

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:84%
difficult to tell how far away
from the Rover the object is.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:84%
The object in
question does appear

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.304 align:middle line:84%
to be bird- or insect-like,
and the object is symmetrical,

00:38:06.304 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
which some say does
away with the theory

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that it might have
been a rock or debris.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:10%
Some who view the image are
certain that it proves things

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.070 align:middle line:10%
are living on Mars.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:84%
There is a long history of
seeing animal shapes on Mars.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.640 align:middle line:84%
This may be due to the fact that
Mars is so tightly associated

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.400 align:middle line:84%
with the search for
life and because we just

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.830 align:middle line:84%
have so many pictures of
the surface to dig through.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think that was, George?

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I have seen
that on the internet.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's a
atmosphere on Mars that

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.940 align:middle line:84%
would sustain a
flying bird, but it

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.300 align:middle line:84%
does look like there's
some odd object up there.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something there.

00:38:44.675 --> 00:38:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Could it be an
anomaly on the lens?

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It could be an
anomaly on the lens.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.640 align:middle line:84%
It does change shape
which is kind of odd.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.827 align:middle line:84%
And you would think that
anomaly, if it was on the lens,

00:38:53.827 --> 00:38:55.160 align:middle line:90%
would be there in every picture.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:55.775 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Correct.

00:38:55.775 --> 00:38:56.691 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's not.

00:38:56.691 --> 00:39:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And it doesn't seem to
be a mechanical thing that's

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:05.060 align:middle line:84%
flying over like a drone because
that would be the same shape.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.710 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be
something moving.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wonder it's
a craft of some kind.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: A live craft
would be interesting.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And that doesn't go
beyond the realm of sci-fi.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, there's lots of
strange things happening out

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.060 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And sometimes science
fiction becomes reality,

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
finding on Mars.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does Mars
mean to you as a researcher?

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: My interest
in Mars goes, like I

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.460 align:middle line:90%
said, way back to Viking.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I have a very strong
attachment to Mars.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm fascinated by it.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And the more I learn, the more
areas that I want to explore.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's very time consuming.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Like, just putting
this few slides here

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking at
today, the amount of time

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.920 align:middle line:84%
you have to wait for NASA
to get collaborating images.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, like the
Viking was in 1976,

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.980 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have the second
image until 21 years later.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.669 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
it take so long?

00:40:00.669 --> 00:40:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And some of
these images that we're

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.890 align:middle line:84%
looking at now, five,
six years between images.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:06.939 align:middle line:90%
It's a long wait.

00:40:06.939 --> 00:40:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think there's
some pictures that NASA has not

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.970 align:middle line:84%
released that might
be astounding?

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're
seeing is stuff

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.080 align:middle line:84%
that gets released to
the public after it goes.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.830 align:middle line:84%
'Cause NASA is also under the
Department of Defense which

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.330 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the public
doesn't realize.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: So they just
can't release anything.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But they have released
enormous amount of evidence

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.440 align:middle line:84%
in what we've been looking
through showing artificiality

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.410 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So I imagine the
high-resolution images

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.750 align:middle line:84%
they're getting from the
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter,

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
we just have a handful of
images just from Cydonia,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and they've been doing this
for since the early 2000s.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And you would think that with
that type of powerful camera,

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.180 align:middle line:84%
we only have one picture
from the Mars Reconnaissance

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Orbiter of the face.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Just one.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
not a good one.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And it's
not a very good one.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.596 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is NASA has always

00:41:02.596 --> 00:41:04.970 align:middle line:84%
contended that they have no
interest in the face on Mars.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:08.640 align:middle line:84%
It has no geological
significance for them to study.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.660 align:middle line:84%
However, if you go
through their archives,

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.614 align:middle line:84%
there's probably about 40
pictures of the face on Mars.

00:41:13.614 --> 00:41:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we're
not interested.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: No interest in, no.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
more about geoglyphs.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.140 align:middle line:90%
What are they, exactly?

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Geoglyphs, we
find these on Earth.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.520 align:middle line:84%
The Nazca Lines--
the American Indians

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.310 align:middle line:84%
made mounds and
geoglyphic formations.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:27.690 align:middle line:90%
They're large structures.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.401 align:middle line:84%
They're either geometric,
or they're pictographic.

00:41:30.401 --> 00:41:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're basically
designed to be either seen

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.510 align:middle line:84%
by the gods or some
vehicle flying overhead

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.854 align:middle line:84%
to look down and see these
and notice that these are

00:41:38.854 --> 00:41:40.020 align:middle line:90%
different areas of interest.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
some geoglyphs on Mars.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:10%
What are we looking
at here, George?

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.540 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: This is a large crater.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.000 align:middle line:84%
This is in Cydonia, the
famous face on Mars.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.980 align:middle line:84%
This is above the face
on Mars to the northeast.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.050 align:middle line:90%
This is in Cydonia.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.300 align:middle line:90%
This is a--

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a great
looking crater, by the way.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: This is a large
circular crater that has,

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.410 align:middle line:10%
what appears to be, a
profiled head of an eagle.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:06.597 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a parrot?

00:42:06.597 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Possibly a parrot.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.100 align:middle line:90%
We're thinking it's an eagle.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we positioned
it to the side.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The eagle on the planet is
actually pointing north.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.867 align:middle line:10%
And looking into
Mesoamerica mythology which

00:42:20.867 --> 00:42:23.200 align:middle line:10%
we were studying with the
parrot formation that we found

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.040 align:middle line:10%
and the face on Mars, all
this Mesoamerican references,

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.600 align:middle line:10%
the eagle was very important.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.730 align:middle line:90%
He was related to the sun.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you
have the axis mundi

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:90%
with the Eagle pointing up.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, below this eagle is a
whole city of bird and deer

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.240 align:middle line:10%
formations in the Cydonia area.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.460 align:middle line:84%
There's over a dozen in
this one condensed area.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.656 align:middle line:84%
This was the first
one that we found.

00:42:45.656 --> 00:42:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at the next image.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.580 align:middle line:90%
There's a parrot look again.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.955 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: There's
the parrot again.

00:42:50.955 --> 00:42:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're looking at this
area directly below the crater,

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.620 align:middle line:90%
that has the eagle in it.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, the eagle--
there's actually

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.160 align:middle line:90%
three craters in that section.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And the other two
craters have nothing

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.550 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom floor
of the crater.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.400 align:middle line:90%
They're completely vacant.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Which was an interesting
thing in looking at the Eagle

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.770 align:middle line:84%
that that one just happened
to have this weird formation

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:90%
in the crater.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, directly below that
is this formation here

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.167 align:middle line:90%
which is on the surface.

00:43:16.167 --> 00:43:18.250 align:middle line:84%
This is placed-- if you
look on the left-- there's

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.404 align:middle line:84%
a image of the parrot
that's not colorized.

00:43:22.404 --> 00:43:24.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a circular
mound on the bottom,

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a large
mound at the top that

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.760 align:middle line:84%
appears to have had its
main body ripped out.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, geologists have
looked at this--

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.960 align:middle line:84%
William Saunders
and Michael Dale.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And geologically, this is
an anomaly to begin with.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: How do you have a
completely circular mound

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:46.660 align:middle line:84%
that's supposedly had all of
this geological disturbances

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.350 align:middle line:84%
with erosion and wind or
whatever, possibly water.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:84%
How would you have
another circular mound

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.080 align:middle line:90%
have an area that gouged out?

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Is this a mound that had
a foundation collapse?

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
thing about this formation

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.420 align:middle line:84%
is that now that they've
taken out that section

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.510 align:middle line:84%
of the top mound,
that surface is

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:12.220 align:middle line:84%
in the shape of a parrot which
is colorized on the right side.

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I provided a drawing of
the parrot on the left

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.700 align:middle line:84%
just to give the audience an
idea of what we're looking at.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing about
this besides the two domes

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and the one that
appears to be collapsed,

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.210 align:middle line:84%
which Gregg Orme, who's a member
of the Society for Planetary

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Study Research, he was
interested in this area.

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:35.570 align:middle line:84%
He never saw the parrot being
an academic and a scientist.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:38.030 align:middle line:84%
He was interested
in the I formation.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.580 align:middle line:10%
Now, the eye has an ellipse.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's a good point.

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And he did a whole
paper, which he had not

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.692 align:middle line:90%
published, about this eye.

00:44:46.692 --> 00:44:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing
measurements and showing

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.880 align:middle line:84%
this ellipse inside the eye
and how this wasn't natural.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, he's
looking at the eye,

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:56.830 align:middle line:90%
and I'm finding the whole body.

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But still, people are
drawn to this area--

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.900 align:middle line:84%
if you want to disregard
the parrot formation-- just

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
these surrounding other objects
in this image are anomalous.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the next image
looks sort of like a deer.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.521 align:middle line:10%
This is in the same area
that we have the parrot.

00:45:14.521 --> 00:45:20.070 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, there's over a
dozen deer and bird formations.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a severed
head of a deer.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I have a drawing
on the right side.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:26.550 align:middle line:90%
You can see the eye, the muzzle.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: His ear.

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: He's got one
triangular tooth.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:34.740 align:middle line:10%
In our research, we have images
of Mesoamerica sever-head deer

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.597 align:middle line:10%
that had this large
triangular tooth.

00:45:37.597 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, the interesting
thing about this,

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.400 align:middle line:10%
we have a bird
sitting on his head.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.230 align:middle line:10%
That's a little dove.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:44.370 align:middle line:10%
Very elaborate.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:48.270 align:middle line:10%
It has a lot of jewel-like
imagery going through its tail,

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.830 align:middle line:10%
and it's sitting
next to his ear.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, the thing we're finding
with these deer and bird

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.010 align:middle line:10%
formations that we're finding in
Cydonia above the face on Mars,

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:59.670 align:middle line:10%
is that birds and deer have
a very close relationship

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:00.540 align:middle line:10%
in nature.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Birds will land on deer and
pick the ticks and parasites

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.710 align:middle line:84%
off the deer to keep
the deer healthy.

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So they have a
real relationship.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:12.974 align:middle line:84%
And once the deer die,
the birds eat the deer.

00:46:12.974 --> 00:46:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then they're able
to take care of each other.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: They take care.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's this very
close relationship.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And we find in
Mesoamerica culture--

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:23.550 align:middle line:84%
going back to the parrot--
the principal bird deity,

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.210 align:middle line:84%
one of the first gods
of the Maya-- the Macaw.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:30.780 align:middle line:84%
In the Maya Popol Vuh,
in the creation story,

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.850 align:middle line:84%
the first animals that
the gods created--

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:35.280 align:middle line:84%
once they created the
paradise of the Earth--

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.560 align:middle line:84%
the first animals they created
to be caretakers for the earth

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.170 align:middle line:90%
were birds and deer.

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:41.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Could this
be, though, George,

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.970 align:middle line:10%
you know how you would
look at a cloud formation,

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.340 align:middle line:10%
and you can see anything
you're looking for.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.540 align:middle line:10%
You can see the face of a dog.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.610 align:middle line:10%
You can see just about--

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:10%
is that maybe what we
could be looking at where

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:55.866 align:middle line:10%
the mind is creating this?

00:46:55.866 --> 00:46:57.240 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Well, that
would be true.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.800 align:middle line:10%
We have numerous
pictures of this

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.490 align:middle line:10%
all confirming
the shape of this.

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:06.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you're looking at
clouds and chance formations,

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.290 align:middle line:90%
usually they're silhouetted.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.540 align:middle line:84%
That would be stage
one of finding

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.580 align:middle line:84%
a pictogram would be
a silhouette which

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:14.380 align:middle line:90%
would be very low.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.290 align:middle line:90%
That would be dismissed.

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:21.070 align:middle line:84%
The second phase would be
having eyes, nose, mouth ear,

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.430 align:middle line:84%
neck, or whatever, if
you're looking at a head.

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.420 align:middle line:90%
That would be the second step.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The third step would
be secondary features

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.230 align:middle line:84%
such as iris in the eye,
nostrils, more detail.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Here we have teeth.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.830 align:middle line:90%
We have the eye.

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:35.160 align:middle line:90%
We have a pupil.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.600 align:middle line:90%
We have a mouth with teeth.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.280 align:middle line:90%
We have a beard on the lower--

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the eyes
are always strange to me.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.910 align:middle line:90%
They really stick out.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:45.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Yeah, and we have
examples of Mesoamerica

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:46.530 align:middle line:10%
examples of deer like this.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:47.420 align:middle line:10%
They're very similar.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And that little crater
knot at the neck,

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:55.020 align:middle line:84%
that's part of the neck
muscle coming down.

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I can't recall what
it's called right now.

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:58.590 align:middle line:90%
But that just shows more of it.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And this whole idea of
severing the head of deer,

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.415 align:middle line:90%
it's very common in Mesoamerica.

00:48:02.415 --> 00:48:05.407 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have our final
image here-- the map of Cydonia.

00:48:05.407 --> 00:48:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, what this map
is showing, this is the area,

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.240 align:middle line:90%
like I said--

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looks like
the Hawaiian Islands.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --these are
all of the mounds that

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:15.870 align:middle line:84%
are above the face on Mars
towards the northeast.

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.600 align:middle line:84%
At the top is where
the head of the eagle

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.265 align:middle line:84%
is inside the crater and
that crater next to it.

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.890 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
third one above that

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:24.897 align:middle line:90%
which isn't in this drawing.

00:48:24.897 --> 00:48:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done is
just done the drawings

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.580 align:middle line:84%
of all of these mounds
that show the birds

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:90%
and the deer that are in there.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So you can see this very
small, condensed area

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.660 align:middle line:84%
on Mars has over a dozen
bird and deer geoglyphs.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where would the
face be based on this?

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:42.857 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: At the lower left
where you see that goose--

00:48:42.857 --> 00:48:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way down at the bottom?

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --yeah, the
large goose at the bottom

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.630 align:middle line:90%
which is facing west.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:49.770 align:middle line:90%
The face would be that way.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And the idea of
having the goose separated

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.300 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of
these, it goes back

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.400 align:middle line:84%
to mythology, too, with
geese, with the Sumerians.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.700 align:middle line:84%
With the bird goddesses,
her companions were geese.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
biblical references

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.940 align:middle line:84%
to the geese with the
saint coming down,

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.120 align:middle line:84%
the Saint of the Birds, and
he had the geese next to him.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So the geese are all part
of this whole "following

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.110 align:middle line:90%
the flock."

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And in here, we have a
roadrunner, we have a parrot,

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.990 align:middle line:84%
we have a hatchling,
we have a raptor eagle,

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.240 align:middle line:84%
we have a mother bird
which is inverted

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.770 align:middle line:84%
feeding a newborn bird, we
have an avian butterfly.

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:31.615 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Maya considered
butterflies birds.

00:49:31.615 --> 00:49:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they did?

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.482 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Butterflies and moths
were birds, and so were bats.

00:49:35.482 --> 00:49:37.065 align:middle line:84%
They were all part
of the bird family.

00:49:37.065 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
the Maya civilization

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:40.905 align:middle line:90%
has anything to do with Mars?

00:49:40.905 --> 00:49:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I think whoever started
the Mayan civilization has

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:45.870 align:middle line:90%
to do with Mars.

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I think the Mayan got their
cultural start from the Olmec

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.315 align:middle line:84%
from a connection
with a Martian.

00:49:51.315 --> 00:49:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
this all tell you

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.620 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening
on Mars or what happened?

00:49:55.620 --> 00:50:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: What it's saying to me
is that Mars is like a living

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Popol Vuh--

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:04.710 align:middle line:84%
the creation story
of the Maya talking

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.740 align:middle line:84%
about the relationship
with the gods of creation,

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.420 align:middle line:90%
with the birds and the deer.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.840 align:middle line:10%
I think Mars is basically
a sacred book showing

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.260 align:middle line:10%
the history of the human
race, and we're finding it

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.840 align:middle line:10%
in all this pictographic stuff.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And the culture that
built this stuff embedded

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.150 align:middle line:84%
all this information in
there hoping someday,

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.240 align:middle line:84%
we would return to Mars and
find our point of origin.

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned
the Nazca Lines in Peru.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, is
where Erich von Daniken

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:33.340 align:middle line:84%
developed his theory of
the chariots of the gods.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:36.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: We're about
to witness one of the most

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:39.310 align:middle line:10%
mysterious wonders on Earth.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest work of art
in the world, so vast, in fact,

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.320 align:middle line:84%
you can only see
it from the sky.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's even been suggested
it was made by aliens.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:55.420 align:middle line:84%
The Nazca Lines-- high up on
a plateau in Pampas de Jumana,

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Peru--

00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:00.160 align:middle line:84%
images carved into the
very ground of the Pampas.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.740 align:middle line:84%
These pictures are
huge, but they're

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:06.080 align:middle line:84%
not visible or even
apparent from the ground.

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.610 align:middle line:84%
You have to take to the air in
a balloon, plane, or helicopter

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:13.550 align:middle line:90%
to see these dramatic shapes.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:16.360 align:middle line:84%
They must be some
kind of message,

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.940 align:middle line:84%
but it's a message
we can't understand.

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.490 align:middle line:84%
This extraordinary
figure, thought

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to be an astronaut by
some, who is he waving to?

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:32.060 align:middle line:90%
What does all this mean?

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.890 align:middle line:84%
The whole landscape
is crisscrossed

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.240 align:middle line:90%
by puzzlingly straight lines.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.770 align:middle line:84%
They go everywhere for
mile upon mile upon mile.

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:41.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like flying
over an airfield.

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:46.900 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.960 align:middle line:84%
How were these huge designs
laid in the landscape

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:55.570 align:middle line:84%
up to 2000 years ago by a people
whose history is now lost?

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think Nazca, George,
is staggering, absolutely

00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.530 align:middle line:90%
staggering.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: It is.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:02.290 align:middle line:84%
As you can see at the Nazca
Lines, there's a lot of birds

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:02.910 align:middle line:90%
there, also.

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And they're all in
this one condensed area.

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:06.430 align:middle line:90%
They're in that small--

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:07.971 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again,
you can only tell

00:52:07.971 --> 00:52:10.370 align:middle line:84%
what it is from above,
like what we saw on Mars.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Exactly.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:14.410 align:middle line:84%
The correlation is not
a fluke, I don't think.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would they
make these kinds of objects?

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:18.940 align:middle line:90%
What would the purpose be?

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Clearly you have to
see it from above,

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:26.320 align:middle line:84%
so it would be either
for the gods or for those

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.032 align:middle line:90%
who are coming by.

00:52:28.032 --> 00:52:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I think, again, that
whoever built these probably

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:34.830 align:middle line:84%
put these as a marker for
us coming from Earth once we

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.350 align:middle line:90%
were a spacefaring culture.

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Going to Mars, using this
as a communication tool

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:44.340 align:middle line:84%
for us to see these structures
like the face on Mars,

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.930 align:middle line:84%
we went over, and that's where
we were initially going to land

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.620 align:middle line:84%
is in Cydonia, but they
ended up landing over

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.760 align:middle line:90%
in the Utopia area.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Interesting that NASA picked
two areas that they found

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.080 align:middle line:90%
the isotope problem with--

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:59.124 align:middle line:84%
the Cydonia and Utopia which
Dr. Brandenburg talked about.

00:52:59.124 --> 00:53:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do you
think about the correlation

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:05.070 align:middle line:84%
between Peru, for
example, and Mars?

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:07.065 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
a tie-in somewhere.

00:53:07.065 --> 00:53:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, it seems
to be a human tradition

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to do pictographs and
geoglyphic formations to be

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:15.930 align:middle line:90%
viewed from above.

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:17.729 align:middle line:84%
It's a human
tradition, and we're

00:53:17.729 --> 00:53:19.020 align:middle line:90%
finding the same thing on Mars.

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.936 align:middle line:84%
I think these things
that we're doing on Earth

00:53:20.936 --> 00:53:23.580 align:middle line:84%
were placed not to
be viewed by gods,

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.770 align:middle line:84%
but whoever was capable of
interplanetary spacecraft

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.590 align:middle line:84%
coming into the area that
we're using these as markers

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:32.940 align:middle line:90%
that they could see from above.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.267 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people talk about
the crop circles being a--

00:53:35.267 --> 00:53:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The same kind of thing.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.615 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: --same type
of thing-- a signal.

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the next major revelation will

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:42.330 align:middle line:90%
be about Mars?

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I think the
current administration,

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.160 align:middle line:84%
with the release about
the lake on Mars,

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:52.470 align:middle line:84%
which is actually data that
was five years ago if you look

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:55.500 align:middle line:84%
into the detail of the
report, that they're

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:59.550 align:middle line:84%
prepared to tell the public
there's not only water on Mars.

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I think the next
shoe to drop is going

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:04.269 align:middle line:84%
to be that they're finding
microbial life on Mars.

00:54:04.269 --> 00:54:06.060 align:middle line:10%
That's because if you
were paying attention

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:09.150 align:middle line:10%
to the internet and the
news and science magazines,

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:13.710 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of talk now
about us contaminating Mars.

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Getting the public
ready for a debate

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:19.230 align:middle line:84%
that when they find microbial
life, you'll have one camp

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.846 align:middle line:84%
will say, well, we
brought it there,

00:54:20.846 --> 00:54:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and the other camp will say,
oh, no, that's Martian life.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And because what
they want to do is

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:26.010 align:middle line:84%
once they get feet
on the ground,

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.440 align:middle line:84%
they want to find the
microbials in the rock.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I think they've already
found them on the surface,

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.670 align:middle line:84%
but they want to find
them inside rocks which

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:33.902 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be contamination.

00:54:33.902 --> 00:54:35.985 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's going
to be the next big story.

00:54:35.985 --> 00:54:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a Mars
movie where astronauts

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:40.710 align:middle line:90%
went to the face.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, they
found an extraterrestrial

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:49.480 align:middle line:84%
who showed them a pictorial
look of what happened to Mars,

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.795 align:middle line:84%
and it got hit by an asteroid
or something like that.

00:54:51.795 --> 00:54:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that movie?

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yes.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The story is very
believable, but I

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.509 align:middle line:84%
think it was an indigenous
battle, not an asteroid.

00:54:59.509 --> 00:55:01.175 align:middle line:84%
I think there was
some kind of conflict.

00:55:01.175 --> 00:55:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nukes.

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Nukes.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah,
following the evidence

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and going with the data,
what Dr. Brandenburg's

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.530 align:middle line:84%
found, that there was some
type of nuclear war on Mars.

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:12.235 align:middle line:90%
And actually, the Maya--

00:55:12.235 --> 00:55:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I know I've talked
about the Maya a lot

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.710 align:middle line:84%
with our iconography and the
motifs that we're finding--

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:21.300 align:middle line:84%
a little known city
of Naranjo in Mexico

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.490 align:middle line:84%
called Naranjo, one
of the older cities,

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.650 align:middle line:84%
goes back to the
creation mythology.

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And in their text, in stelae,
pottery they talk about a--

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.770 align:middle line:84%
this is archaeologists
talking, not me--

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:33.285 align:middle line:90%
it's called a star war.

00:55:33.285 --> 00:55:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ancient India writings
talk about a nuclear war.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Exactly.

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:40.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what if it
wasn't here, it was there.

00:55:40.575 --> 00:55:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Exactly what I
was going to say, George.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:44.880 align:middle line:84%
What we're finding
in Mesoamerica,

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.190 align:middle line:84%
ancient Indian
texts, I think even

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:49.860 align:middle line:84%
revelations in the Bible
talking about all this conflict

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and this destruction I
think is ancient stories

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:54.330 align:middle line:90%
about what happened on Mars.

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:55.740 align:middle line:90%
The destruction happened there--

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:59.730 align:middle line:84%
this nuclear war that the
Indians talk about and also

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:03.250 align:middle line:84%
the star war that the Maya
talk about which interestingly,

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:06.850 align:middle line:84%
was with a city
called 6-Earth-Place.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Mayan archaeologists
can't find this place.

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a star war
between Naranjo, Tikal,

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:14.040 align:middle line:90%
and 6-Earth-Place.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the patron god of
Naranjo was the serpent

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:18.760 align:middle line:90%
which was the Zip monster.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Zip monster's
a symbol of Mars.

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And Mars, like the
Sumerians, the ancient Maya

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:26.020 align:middle line:90%
numbered the planets.

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Earth was seven, and the
Sumerians earth was seven.

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Venus was the number eight.

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Mars was the number six.

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So they numbered the planets
from the outside in just

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:39.420 align:middle line:90%
like the Sumerians.

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, 6-Earth-Place is
an earth-like planet--

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Mars.

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.720 align:middle line:90%
So 6-Earth-Place is Mars.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Their patron god was the
Zip monster which is Mars.

00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:49.330 align:middle line:10%
So there's this
overlaying symbolism.

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:52.380 align:middle line:10%
So this is where this battle
was that the Maya record.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.940 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting
thing about it

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:55.356 align:middle line:10%
is that the
archaeologists haven't

00:56:55.356 --> 00:56:57.510 align:middle line:10%
realized that 6-Earth-Place
is actually Mars.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:58.470 align:middle line:10%
That's what they're
talking about.

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:00.011 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, keep
up the good work.

00:57:00.011 --> 00:57:02.075 align:middle line:84%
And one day, maybe
we'll get these answers.

00:57:02.075 --> 00:57:04.242 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I think once we get
the answers, George, you

00:57:04.242 --> 00:57:05.533 align:middle line:90%
and I will be talking about it.

00:57:05.533 --> 00:57:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.930 align:middle line:10%
Nothing has been more
exciting for me in my career

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:13.650 align:middle line:10%
than watching these things
unfold on planet Mars.

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding
more and more things.

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.070 align:middle line:90%
