>>SEAN STONE:
These are the times

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.467 align:middle line:90%
that we've been waiting for.

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.480 align:middle line:84%
These are the times of
great transformation.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.850 align:middle line:84%
The hidden truths that
have been kept from humans

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.380 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
reveal themselves.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We know there are
people that are trying

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:90%
to control other human beings.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: No question.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I'm not here to
indoctrinate anyone and tell

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:90%
them how to think.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:84%
All I want them to do is stop
listening to the mainstream

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:90%
media narrative.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Because every person has the
right and the power to see

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:90%
the reality for themselves.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to step into
our inner intuition.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Can I trust myself
to become the leader?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is what this age
that we're approaching now

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:90%
is really about.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Sean Stone is with us.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:10%
He's the host of Gaia's
series, "Buzzsaw."

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.010 align:middle line:10%
He's also a filmmaker, author,
actor, poet, and above all,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:10%
truth seeker and
spiritual activist.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.432 align:middle line:84%
Sean, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It's a pleasure to
be here with you, George.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.057 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about your works.

00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:90%
You've got a book on poetry out.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I've got, well
not on poetry hopefully.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:10%
It's a book of poems called
"The Ephemeral Shades of Time,"

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:10%
and it's a collection of
poems that I've written really

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:10%
since high school.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.445 align:middle line:10%
I would say it's a coming of age
of the fantasy act, as we say,

00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:10%
the end of the 20th
century, at the beginning

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.153 align:middle line:10%
of the 21st century.

00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So the poetry that was
in my soul before 9/11,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
through that time period, the
darkness that I think we all

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.737 align:middle line:90%
felt in that post 9/11 era.

00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: The 2000s.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it's basically of
a young man's reflections

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
on his reality, on
love, and the world.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I was traveling at
a young age going

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:84%
to refugee camps in
places like Sudan

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and in Kenya and
Ethiopia and Somalia

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and reflecting on
these journeys.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So it comes from
a place of soul.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a deep part of
you that I did not see before.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Really?

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:55.155 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I'm shallow
on the surface.

00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not shallow,
but I just didn't

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
know that you were into
that aspect of life

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.487 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
What else is there in life
except to hopefully share

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
our souls in different
capacity through our search,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
our quest for knowledge if
we're not looking for the deeper

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
truths then we get lost in the
maze of the labyrinth I call

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
it, of mind, the
labyrinth of politics

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and the momentary
expectations and desires.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's new
with Sean Stone?

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Surviving.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the basis of it.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We're all surviving a
very difficult time.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I would
say that in a deeper level,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
these are the times that
we've been waiting for.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:84%
These are the times of
great transformation.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:90%
The Great Awakening, so-called.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:84%
It's to me, it
resonates very deeply

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
with what people like
myself and you have been

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:90%
talking about for a long time.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:84%
The deeper truths,
the hidden truths

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.588 align:middle line:84%
that have been kept
from humans are

00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:90%
beginning to reveal themselves.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I think more and more
people are realizing

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot more
going on behind the scenes.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
the time basically

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
for us to do what we've
been trained to do.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:84%
We've been trained by our
knowledge, by our education,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.538 align:middle line:84%
by the hosting and
the questioning

00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and the research that
we've done over these years

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
to help guide people
in these times.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I feel.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're
giving them a vehicle

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:84%
to kind of escape what's
going on in life right now.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Escape, but
at a deeper level,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.010 align:middle line:84%
to actually really
witness it perhaps.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
To go, see, I think
that we're all

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:84%
facing modalities of
control and whether or not

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:84%
we agree with the
modalities of control.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
In the grand scheme
of things, we

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
have beings that want
to control other humans.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:90%
We talked about aliens.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about the power
structure, the political power

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But in our reality, the question
is, who controls your reality?

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think at a deeper level,
we're realizing we have to be.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I am sovereign over
myself in my reality.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
That's where I think
we are each confronting

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:84%
this moment of saying, do I
trust that I can take control,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
so I can step into
my sovereignty

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and stop looking
to the leadership,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
whether it be spiritual,
scientific, political, to tell

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:90%
me what to do.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Can I trust myself
to become the leader?

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is what this age
that we're approaching now

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:90%
is really about.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are the
son of a director I

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:90%
admire, Oliver Stone.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Growing up with
Oliver as your dad,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
did he teach you some of
these spiritual aspects?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Where did this
come from for you?

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.022 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Yes, it came from,
to a certain degree, from him.

00:04:19.022 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:90%
From my mother as well.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.287 align:middle line:84%
She also took me to self
realization fellowship.

00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Which
practiced meditation.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was a place
that respected

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and integrated all religions.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:90%
It was created by Yogananda.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was, you
studied from the Koran,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
as you study from the Torah,
as you study from the New

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Testament or from Buddhism.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So both my parents were
open-minded in that regard

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and very fluid when it
came to spiritual practice.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:90%
They were never dogmatic.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So that young age, I was
exposed to spiritual teachings

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and I started integrating
meditation into my worldview.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:84%
My father took me to places
like India, Nepal and Tibet

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:90%
when I was 10 years old.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.013 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: He taught me about
the third eye and these things

00:04:56.013 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
they really were
difficult, because when

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
you're a young man from the
West and you're 10 years old

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.278 align:middle line:84%
and you're impatient and you're
spoiled and you want your toys

00:05:03.278 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and you want immediate
gratification,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.737 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult to
understand that there's

00:05:06.737 --> 00:05:10.650 align:middle line:84%
a deeper patience that we have
to learn to surrender ourselves

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:90%
to again.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.662 align:middle line:84%
There's what, some
divine power that

00:05:13.662 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
seems to be working
through creation to give us

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.048 align:middle line:90%
this magic that we call life.

00:05:17.048 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At that
young age, was there

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
anything that scared you
when you were confronted

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.335 align:middle line:90%
by all these things?

00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Many things.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I think death is the fundamental
fear that we all face.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Our fundamental fears are--

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.543 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At any age.

00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: --Scarcity, scarcity,
and lack, feel of lack,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:90%
death is that ultimate lack.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
You lack life.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we are afraid of death,
if we don't confront death,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.650 align:middle line:84%
in my teenage years, you
ask about the poetry.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Very much the poetry was
in the Jim Morrison sense,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
a fascination with death,
a romanticization of death

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But it was like I
had to look at death

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and say, you are
inevitable, death.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:90%
What happens thereafter?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to that place,
and in that case for me,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
it was going to that place
through some journeys.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I did a film called "Greystone
Park" about exploring a haunted

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:84%
mental hospital and
experiencing entities

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I felt demonic that were
from a different dimension.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that death
is not the end.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you know
it in your soul

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
that death is not
the end of living,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
your soul will continue
the energy that you are.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a transition,
that's all it is.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.272 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: The
transition, then there's

00:06:19.272 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:90%
nothing to fear anymore.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
All that really matters is what
you do with your soul energy

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:90%
through this incarnation.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.583 align:middle line:84%
Because this is not the
beginning or the end

00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:90%
of who we really are.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your book on poems is
called "The Ephemeral Shades

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:90%
of Time" book.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.212 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing
book, and how many

00:06:34.212 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:90%
poems do you have in there?

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It's about 100 pages.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll get
a million emails

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
if I don't play
one of your poems.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.474 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look.

00:06:42.474 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Imagine a world
where hugs are greetings,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:84%
where words are honored because
we are genuinely happy to share

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:90%
this world with each other.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:10%
Imagine a world where contracts
are expansions and agreements

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:10%
are oral, because goods are
transacted between friends

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:10%
until all share in the wealth.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a world where you're
not seen as a commodity,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
because millions won't follow
soulless posers ignoring

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.497 align:middle line:84%
the cues of social engineers,
for we are all creators.

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a world where
people do what's

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
right by trusting
their intuition,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
no matter what their leaders
and laws tell them to.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a world where
the sickness in our souls

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:84%
is treated as carefully as
a doctor working in the ER,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:84%
knowing that healing
only happens inside.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:10%
Imagine a world
where feelings are

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.970 align:middle line:10%
valued enough to be expressed
instead of scoffed at,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:10%
because in the eyes of the young
is the heart of the mature.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a world where
imagination is honored

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and society looks
at its own shadows

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:84%
rather than projecting
them out onto others.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:90%
We'd all be set free.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we stopped trying
to force the world the way

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:84%
we want it to be, and start
to love our life just the way

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if every child were
told that they are enough.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Instead of competing for more,
we'd make room for everyone.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a world where you have
nothing to prove, to breathe

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
is the miracle, to people
smile at your sight,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to know you are welcome
and thanks for being here.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:31.418 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder,
Sean, how much hope that

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.402 align:middle line:90%
would give people nowadays.

00:08:36.402 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: That's why
we wrote it in a way.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is written
before the pandemic,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:84%
but I always trust that
the universe has a time

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:90%
and a place for everything.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.823 align:middle line:84%
And you heard the music
that accompanied it.

00:08:46.823 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the spoken
word album that's now released.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.565 align:middle line:84%
And it's my poetry spoken to
the music of Michel Huygen who's

00:08:54.565 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful composer.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It kind of reminded
me of a little Bob Dylan.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Well.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.343 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got a
little flavor like that.

00:09:00.343 --> 00:09:02.065 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I like
that, yeah, why not?

00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Use the voice to tell
something meaningful,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:84%
not just to sell people on soap
and pop brands, gum and soda,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:90%
pop soda.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're actually
supposed to give something

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:90%
meaningful with our words.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
poems that you write,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:90%
you're trying to reach people.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to get
them to understand

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
their life a little bit better,
our lives a little bit better.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Is there a story
that you think you

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:84%
can tell us that
you touched somebody

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:90%
with some of your work?

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: You know,
it's interesting

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing
similar things to you

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:84%
with "Buzzsaw" over
the years, hosting,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and that show started
in 2013-14 time period.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes we're
doing this kind of work

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and we're sharing our voice,
sharing insights, interviewing,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
but also asking
questions, trying to guide

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:90%
people to think different--

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to think outside of the box, to
look at the world differently.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, it
feels very lonely,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
because we are going
against the grain.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
We're not the mainstream
media accepted,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.480 align:middle line:90%
approved PC version of reality.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right?

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:84%
We're giving people a
different version of reality.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:90%
And it feels very lonely.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.405 align:middle line:84%
So I can tell you
that over the years,

00:10:15.405 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
gratifying things

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
is finding that we have
fans, that people say

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.447 align:middle line:90%
your show changed my worldview.

00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You touched them.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It touched them.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
It made them look at
things differently.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've experienced that
from many people's reflecting,

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's to me, one
of the great gifts

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
is to feel that
I'm being received

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and to feel that people
can at least appreciate

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:84%
the work that I'm doing,
just like you're doing.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just, we're here
to help awaken society.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you keep busy.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about the "Thousand
Pieces" documentary.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: "Thousand
Pieces" is a reference

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:84%
to JFK when he said he wanted
to splinter the CIA into 1,000

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
pieces after the
Bay of Pigs fiasco.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could have been
his beginning of the end,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Undoubtedly,
undoubtedly.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.202 align:middle line:84%
For those of us that believe in
conspiracy around the Kennedy

00:11:03.202 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:84%
assassination, there
were many factors.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And certainly, the
CIA would be a player that you

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
cannot discount their
involvement, even,

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
especially when E. Howard Hunt,
the famous CIA agent on his

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:84%
deathbed did say he was in
Dallas and that there was

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:90%
a conspiracy.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There was a conspiracy.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:90%
He told his son that.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes, yes.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So Kennedy going after
the CIA, he understood

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
that as Truman actually had
likewise thereafter said,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.220 align:middle line:84%
you know, it was an American
Gestapo had been created.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, this organization
that was not really

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:84%
designed to serve American
interests necessarily,

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
it was designed to
serve an oligarchy.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why some of the CIA
directors over the years

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
are former Wall Street
bankers or lawyers.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.383 align:middle line:84%
They're tied to a
financial elite.

00:11:45.383 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
one who was there

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.987 align:middle line:84%
during Kennedy's administration
was Allen Dulles.

00:11:48.987 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: At the beginning.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
hated each other.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So Kennedy gave him the medal
and then got rid of him.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And got rid of him.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So he felt that the
CIA was something

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that was Dulles' creation and
had Dulles' personnel and did

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
not, he did not, Kennedy
did not trust it.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.595 align:middle line:84%
He really wanted to shift the
power to his direct military,

00:12:07.595 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
because the president
constitutionally is in charge

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
of the military, so he
wanted to basically get

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
the CIA and all covert
operations really more

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
into special forces and
Joint Chiefs of Staff

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:90%
and the military side of things.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So the documentary
"A Thousand Pieces"

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:90%
is not about Kennedy per se.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It's about the deep state
that many people have

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:90%
talked about over the years.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:90%
We have few whistleblowers.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I just narrated the documentary,
I didn't really direct it.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:90%
I just gave my voice to it.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:84%
But we have whistleblowers like
Cathy O'Brien, Robert David

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Steele, John de
Souza and Joe Flynn,

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Michael Flynn's brother,
and Robyn Gritz,

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.140 align:middle line:84%
five whistleblowers who
basically are telling us

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.255 align:middle line:90%
how the deep state is permanent.

00:12:52.255 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like you think
about it like this.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a bureaucracy that is in
Washington that doesn't really

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.135 align:middle line:84%
matter if you're
Republican or Democrat.

00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Most of these people aren't
even elected officials.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
They're the Kissingers
of the world.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They're the
people that are there

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:84%
no matter who's in charge,
and they're influencing

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.577 align:middle line:90%
the political agenda.

00:13:07.577 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are behind
the scene power brokers.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Correct, correct.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes they're
right in front of you,

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
like James Comey or people
like this who you can see.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right under your nose.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.453 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Right in front of
you, but they're not elected.

00:13:17.453 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're simply moved
from position to position,

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.763 align:middle line:84%
and they influence
regimes, administrations

00:13:21.763 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
as they come and go,
because as you say,

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
the president is, you're
a four to eight year deal

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and then you're just the CEO
of the company for a few years.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But the company, the
corporation itself, the policies

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:90%
stay the same.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:90%
I think that's changing though.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.843 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
starting to realize

00:13:35.843 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that the Oz, the Wizard of Oz
is that scrawny little man that

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.848 align:middle line:84%
really only has a big
megaphone and no power.

00:13:43.848 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
behind the curtain.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Hiding with his megaphone, just
blasting, using that big voice,

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that megaphone of the media
to tell people what to think.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.055 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
we as a humanity

00:13:55.055 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:84%
are going to be under
that spell much longer.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I think we are waking.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people will awake?

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the big question.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Does it matter?

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Does it matter?

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end
of the day, that's

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
for every individual soul
to decide for themselves.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
that each one of us,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
we are here for a
reason at this time.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And it is up to
myself, you, each of us

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
to basically be the light that
we are, to shed the light,

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:84%
to inform others where
we can, and to awaken

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:90%
those who are ready.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And those that
can't be ready, then

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
maybe they will shift into
a different type of society,

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
a different type
of organization.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't be worried
about everyone

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't want to wake up.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I can only do my part in
awakening those who do.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did you become
aware of the JFK controversy?

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Was it because of your
father's movie, "JFK?"

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or was-- that
was the catalyst for you?

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, sure, seven
years old watching that film,

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I was entranced.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I was entranced,
and I was curious

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.357 align:middle line:90%
since that time about power.

00:14:55.357 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:90%
I've always tried to understand.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.672 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Who has
power in this world?

00:14:58.672 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Because anyone can be
killed, even the president.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:84%
The most powerful man in the
world can be assassinated.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:90%
So who has power?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.277 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
through it and you

00:15:07.277 --> 00:15:09.652 align:middle line:84%
start to realize, OK, well,
CIA has power because they're

00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:84%
doing black operations, but
then who really runs them?

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.548 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're working for
the financial oligarchy,

00:15:14.548 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, the people, the
private bankers of the world,

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, and secret societies
that basically are organizing

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
themselves in such a way that
we don't see what they're really

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:84%
doing, because unless you're
initiated to that level,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
to understand

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:90%
what their agenda is.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But then you have a Bill
Gates, who's got as much money

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:90%
as half the planet.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, $100
billion or something,

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and controlling most
of America's farmland.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:90%
So is he--

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder who'd pick up
the check between he and Jeff

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Bezos.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: The point
is, where is, who

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
has the power at
the end of the day?

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you come to the
spiritual realization,

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual realization
that all that really matters

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
is creation itself,
and that there

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is something working through
us that is divine and destiny,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.460 align:middle line:90%
you could say.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a destiny that even
when we think it's dark

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and we think that these worldly
rulers, as Christ talked about,

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:84%
the powers and the
principalities and others that

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
try to rule us,
but do they really

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.695 align:middle line:84%
have power or is it the
spirit of creation itself?

00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I trust in.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.195 align:middle line:84%
I trust in the
spirit of creation

00:16:17.195 --> 00:16:20.470 align:middle line:84%
that everything is being
guided for a higher purpose.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Even the dark serves the light.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would the
producers of "A Thousand

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Pieces" hope to accomplish?

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They were
hoping to help people

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.230 align:middle line:84%
that were, let's say,
willing to understand

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
what the deep state
was as a concept.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.538 align:middle line:84%
And very much as, you know,
I did a book a few years ago

00:16:41.538 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:90%
called "New World Order."

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I think we talked
about it on a previous show.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And it's just about
getting people who are ready,

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:90%
who are ready to understand.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't force
people to wake up.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.900 align:middle line:84%
If you try to shake someone
and they're in a deep sleep.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've got
to do it on their own.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: They hate you.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
They hate you when
you shake someone.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're tired and you
really want to sleep

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and someone's shaking
you, you hate that person.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.627 align:middle line:90%
Leave me alone.

00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But if someone's ready,
if someone started to say,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.839 align:middle line:84%
you know, I can hear the
alarm, I can hear the world,

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:09.573 align:middle line:84%
I can hear the birds and
I'm OK, I want to wake up,

00:17:09.573 --> 00:17:10.990 align:middle line:84%
these are the tools
that we offer.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Things like our work, the
documentary "The Thousand

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Pieces" documentary, the
"New World Order" book,

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:84%
these are just little tools
that people can start to say,

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:84%
now I'm starting to see behind
the scenes a little bit.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm starting to get a
bigger picture so that I

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:90%
can start to think for myself.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.327 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not here to
indoctrinate anyone and tell

00:17:26.327 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:90%
them how to think.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:84%
All I want them to do is stop
listening to the mainstream

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:90%
media narrative.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Because every person has the
right and the power to see

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:90%
the reality for themselves.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to be
given the approval by CNN

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to have an idea.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:84%
What was it that got your
father interested in the JFK

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:90%
assassination?

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Was it Jim Garrison?

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.302 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I thought.

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Garrison was a man who
my father very much respected,

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:90%
spent time with.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.620 align:middle line:84%
He saw him, his
integrity, and understood

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
that he was genuine in
his pursuit of truth.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:10%
So Garrison was the
gateway for my father

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:10%
to study the assassination.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I don't
think my father would tell you

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.610 align:middle line:84%
exactly how it all worked
because again, when you start

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:84%
getting to that level, I talked
earlier about secret societies,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds of indications
of something that's so subtle

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and so almost beyond the pale
of what I understand is reality,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.587 align:middle line:84%
for an event to
work perfectly, it's

00:18:23.587 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:84%
almost like there
is a conspiracy that

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:90%
transcends normal space time.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a mutual
friend, Deepak Chopra.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've worked
on a documentary with him.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what that was like.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Yes, Deepak's
a wonderful, at least

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
in my experience, a
wonderful warm man.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And Deepak, I interviewed
for this documentary called

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:84%
"MetaHuman" at the same
time that he was working

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:90%
on his book, "Metahuman."

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So when I
interviewed Deepak,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
he really helped me to
understand that everything

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:90%
is consciousness.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.592 align:middle line:84%
We talk a little bit about
the nature of, I say spirit,

00:18:58.592 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, the spirit
that guides reality.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.493 align:middle line:84%
Well, consciousness is
indicative of that spirit,

00:19:03.493 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know what
consciousness comes from.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't, it doesn't really
quite connect to the brain.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:84%
The brain, so that's
why a lot of people

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:84%
try to reduce
everything to the body.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's out there
somewhere, but from where,

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:90%
who knows?

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Where is mind?

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, where is mind?

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.238 align:middle line:90%
Where is consciousness?

00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is so unique,
that if you notice in your life

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.310 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
shift your perspective,

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
how things follow as a
result. How you oftentimes

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.772 align:middle line:90%
will call it synchronicity.

00:19:24.772 --> 00:19:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Jung talked about this a lot.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
You start to see, oh
someone mentioned this name,

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.313 align:middle line:84%
and then you see that, someone
else mentions the name.

00:19:31.313 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Or you see a movie
with that actor

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that you just talked
about two minutes ago.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.240 align:middle line:84%
This is indications that
consciousness is our reality.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.607 align:middle line:84%
My experience of consciousness
is all I can ever know.

00:19:41.607 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And all you can ever
know is your experience

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, until we
return to the eternal ocean

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:90%
that connects all of us.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia program,
"Escape the Matrix" with David

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Icke, he talks about how
the real revolution in life

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:90%
will come from love.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.490 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID ICKE: Love is not
to agree with everything

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:90%
and it's not to roll over.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I think I've got a fair
record in the last 30 years

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:90%
of not rolling over.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean you
have to hate the people

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that you're challenging and
exposing, because if you do,

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:90%
you become them.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.406 align:middle line:84%
And there's this other
idea that love is weak.

00:20:26.406 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's into love.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:90%
What are you into?

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm strong, I'm anti-hate!

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Love is weak.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Love is the very absence of what
is perceived to be weakness.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Why? 'Cause it will always
do what it knows to be right.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Won't consider
consequences for doing

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
what it knows to be right,
it would just do them.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Another thing about love,
it's the absence of fear.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Because what love
connects us to,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.950 align:middle line:84%
the very fabric
of all existence,

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is the understanding that
there is nothing to fear.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:90%
What is death?

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a transition
of our awareness,

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
our point of attention into
another reality of experience.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:84%
It's another birth,
not death at all.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So what is there
to be frightened

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:90%
about in terms of that?

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.750 align:middle line:84%
What is there to
be frightened about

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what people say
about us and what have you?

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:84%
When we are on an
infinite journey

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and this is just an
infinitesimal little brief

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:84%
experience, there
is nothing to fear.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Love knows that.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So it will always stand up
for what it knows to be right.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, people
talk about courage,

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:90%
which is a great thing.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:90%
But what is courage?

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability to overcome
fear and do it anyway.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But there's another stage
beyond that in which

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
you eliminate the fear
and no longer need

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:84%
the courage to overcome
what is no longer there.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's a challenge in
this world, of course it is,

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:84%
but that's what love in its
prime state actually is.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.495 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy that
will change everything.

00:22:35.495 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
he's right, Sean.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Love, love is a power
that nothing can stand against.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
earlier about control.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
how people, there

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
are people and beings
that are trying to control

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.050 align:middle line:90%
other humans in their reality.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
The Gates of the
world, how much control

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:90%
can they have over others.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't love.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Control is
a fear-based pattern.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Love
doesn't need control.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.285 align:middle line:90%
Love is when you surrender.

00:23:02.285 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.363 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: You say, you know what?

00:23:04.363 --> 00:23:05.587 align:middle line:90%
You do you, I love you.

00:23:05.587 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know we'd
have no wars on this planet

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:84%
if every nation's leader
would practice that.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: We have
to get there first.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy, no one
nation can do it alone.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It requires the
consciousness of the humanity

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:90%
to raise that vibration.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
to be all or none.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Exactly.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And to shake off.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So I see the world right
now as the absolute control

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:84%
of the new world order agenda
rolling out to basically say,

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:90%
everything must be controlled.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Vaccine passports,
where you travel,

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.352 align:middle line:90%
being tracked and traced.

00:23:35.352 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The money you spend.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.435 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: You name it.

00:23:37.435 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Mandate vaccines,
mandate whatever is.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Control the human.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't realize
is this is God's universe

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and the natural universe
you cannot control anything,

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
because man plans
and God laughs.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who
understands true love,

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
understands that
control never works.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Authoritarianism
will always die,

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:84%
because the human
spirit activates.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:84%
The more authoritarian
you become,

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.400 align:middle line:84%
the more you try
to enforce things,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:84%
the more you create a rebellion
and a rise of the human spirit

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.420 align:middle line:84%
to say in the name of
love, which is free,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:84%
true freedom is just love,
we invoke our sovereignty

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and say we no longer
wish to partake

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:84%
in that form, that structure
of organization in society.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
to this level yourself?

00:24:19.775 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:27.233 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Because it's what my
soul brought me here to do.

00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a great
feeling, isn't it?

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I've always
known certain things,

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen certain
things, and I've

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
seen certain things many years
before they materialized.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I did a short film called
"Singularity" in 2008

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:84%
about a virus that
would lead to a society

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.173 align:middle line:84%
of total surveillance,
total control.

00:24:43.173 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were way
ahead of yourself.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Orwellian.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Way ahead
of yourself, yeah.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And how
much it plays out.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But I always understood that it
would be the death of the human

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:84%
as we knew it, but actually
again, it cannot work,

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
because that spirit, that
which is divine that is working

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
through us, that has
given life to this world,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:90%
cannot be controlled.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just,
it's a knowing when

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.880 align:middle line:84%
you have come into
this world from a place

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and a soul level of past
life knowledge, past life

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
experience, knowing that
we've been called to this time

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and place to be a light amongst
many other lights that are out

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're all, I think we're
seeing each other more clearly

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.710 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you meditate a lot?

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: I do.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I would say daily.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can tell.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:90%
I can tell.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And you seem much more
spiritual than you even were

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:90%
the last time we got together.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
changing quickly.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.755 align:middle line:90%
What's fueling that?

00:25:37.755 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
The events of the
past few years?

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my growth, I'm
maturing, you know, I'm

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in a partnership
with my partner,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Kaya teaches breathwork,
which I advocate for people

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.965 align:middle line:90%
because breathwork is a--

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that breathing?

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.465 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It's a
type of breathing

00:25:52.465 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:84%
that activates you could
say altered states.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give me an example.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well,
I'll tell you, she

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:84%
teaches circular breathwork,
which basically is continuous

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:90%
breathing.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.370 align:middle line:90%
And you do it for about an hour.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And you literally go
into an altered state,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:84%
because it's not to
say that you're, you

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.005 align:middle line:84%
don't need drugs to
get to that place.

00:26:09.005 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And meditation
can get you there,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:84%
but it takes a lot of
meditation to do it.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's much safer too.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And you just do it with
yourself, with your own breath.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
the power, this is

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.237 align:middle line:84%
what a lot of the yogis,
a lot of the ancient,

00:26:18.237 --> 00:26:20.850 align:middle line:84%
the Cathars, a lot of the
mystic schools, they always did

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:90%
breathwork.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But people didn't
necessarily understand it.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.860 align:middle line:84%
They would say it was
like demonic or something.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.763 align:middle line:84%
They were consorting with demons
and like some of these Cathars

00:26:28.763 --> 00:26:31.180 align:middle line:84%
were persecuted by the church,
for example, the Catholics.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've noticed
this, Sean, too,

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting with
what you're talking about.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With
moments before you're

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:84%
about to do something
big, whether it's

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.920 align:middle line:84%
a kid at a baseball
game getting up to bat

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.500 align:middle line:84%
or you've got a big
speech or something,

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.284 align:middle line:90%
people always seem to go.

00:26:48.284 --> 00:26:49.676 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

00:26:49.676 --> 00:26:51.070 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES]

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.667 align:middle line:90%
And then they go and do it.

00:26:52.667 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Is that a little bit of
what you're talking about?

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Deep breath
is the beginning of it.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And then certainly whatever you
want to do with your breath,

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:90%
it's yours.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.220 align:middle line:90%
You can do many practices.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.553 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty of breathwork.

00:27:03.553 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize the power if we
only tune in to our own breath.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, I've seen many yogis
talk about this over the years.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:84%
The power of many of their
feats that the yogis have

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
been described as magical,
mystical, often at times,

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.800 align:middle line:84%
they just describe
it as literally

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:84%
using breath to shift
their entire being,

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.290 align:middle line:90%
their entire reality.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are being
bombarded nowadays

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of things,
social network, fake news,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.860 align:middle line:84%
interpretations by
the cable networks.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.230 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to handle all that?

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Learning
to trust ourselves.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like we have a humanity
here for thousands of years,

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I would say that has been
mentally put into servitude,

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.340 align:middle line:84%
mentally put into the patterns
of believing the government

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:84%
takes care of this, the doctor
does that, the scientist knows

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:55.150 align:middle line:90%
this, religion knows that.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:84%
We have to step into
our inner intuition

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.830 align:middle line:84%
knowing that I am sovereign
over my mind, body

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.103 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, that I actually am
the creator of my own reality.

00:28:04.103 --> 00:28:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right?

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And that I can then transact
in commerce with people.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.707 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the future
of commerce is

00:28:10.707 --> 00:28:12.290 align:middle line:84%
the harmony of
interests saying, well,

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I can transact
with human beings.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.055 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to transact
with big corporations that

00:28:16.055 --> 00:28:18.700 align:middle line:84%
have no soul, no personality,
no face, they're just,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.200 align:middle line:84%
they're just there
to take my money.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I want to transact with
human beings and commerce

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:26.020 align:middle line:84%
with human beings and
choose my reality.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:90%
That's where I see us going.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And so media overall has been
mass mind control, mass spell

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.232 align:middle line:84%
casting, because they've
played upon fears.

00:28:35.232 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Intentionally.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Intentionally, fears.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
You look at the origins of
media before Mockingbird,

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.390 align:middle line:84%
when the CIA was
buying journalists,

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:84%
the origins of media
itself came out

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.550 align:middle line:84%
of OSS, Office of
Strategic Services,

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:90%
war propaganda In World War II.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people
that were in the heads

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
of the various studios,
networks, the beginning,

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.515 align:middle line:84%
had backgrounds in military
intelligence or overall you

00:28:59.515 --> 00:29:00.890 align:middle line:84%
mind, you could
say mind control.

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look how the
Nazis handled propaganda.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had a
department that did that.

00:29:05.425 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It was a Ministry of Propaganda.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
knew how to handle it.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Social
media today is huge.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Good or bad for us?

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Everything
is good and bad,

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.240 align:middle line:84%
everything is
positive and negative.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's what we do with it.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Social media, as
far as the way I

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.590 align:middle line:84%
see these platforms
censoring people and content,

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:90%
that's unhealthy.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that they
have the right to do that.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:90%
On the other hand--

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
private enterprise.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So it's a
private enterprise,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.708 align:middle line:84%
but they're getting certain
benefits from government.

00:29:34.708 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And so this was a big deal when
it came to this Section 230

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and the recent
NDAA Bill of 2021.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.743 align:middle line:84%
The point is, that
they should be,

00:29:42.743 --> 00:29:44.410 align:middle line:84%
if they're going to
be censoring people,

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.360 align:middle line:84%
they should be considered
as any other media, a media

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:90%
conglomerate.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:90%
"The New York Times," CNN.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They don't get any
benefits, because they're not

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:51.702 align:middle line:90%
free platforms.

00:29:51.702 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So if Twitter wants to censor,
they're not a free platform.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.050 align:middle line:84%
If Facebook wants to censor,
they're not a free platform

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So I think that
there's a great benefit

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:90%
for social media.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Just like the internet, if we
as people, again, commerce,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and we create our own
platforms and hopefully don't

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:84%
get censored from
the internet itself,

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
so that we can actually have
our own platforms to say,

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, we don't want to
work on Facebook anymore,

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.720 align:middle line:90%
let's create our own Facebook.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You interviewed
journalist David Seaman

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.370 align:middle line:90%
on "Buzzsaw" about this.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Do you think that
what we're going to see now

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.320 align:middle line:84%
is that Facebook, Twitter
and these other platforms

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:84%
are going to try to
work to basically censor

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.710 align:middle line:90%
the alternative voices?

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.168 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID SEAMAN:
Some of them appear

00:30:29.168 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:84%
to be heading in that direction,
and they're just going to lose,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.500 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
lose business-wise.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Why would I use Facebook
if I know they're starting

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.225 align:middle line:90%
to censor alternative views?

00:30:38.225 --> 00:30:40.850 align:middle line:84%
People used to log into Facebook
to see what their friends were

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:84%
thinking and to see what the
non-mainstream people were

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.885 align:middle line:84%
At least some people do that,
that's the point of Twitter

00:30:46.885 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:90%
is to get these different views.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.530 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, what I
had read, I don't

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.440 align:middle line:10%
know how credible this is,
but Zuckerberg and Facebook

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:10%
were considering using
Media Matters for America

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.600 align:middle line:10%
as the third party
vetting source

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.440 align:middle line:10%
for what is fake news or not,
which I take exception to that.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the founder
of Media Matters

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.870 align:middle line:84%
is David Brock, a very
close Clinton insider.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.355 align:middle line:84%
This is not a claim that
anybody can push back against,

00:31:11.355 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:90%
because everybody knows it.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.420 align:middle line:84%
He's very close to
the Clintons, and he's

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
very close to some of
the people involved

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.100 align:middle line:84%
in some upcoming
political scandals.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So they're simply not
credible to judge something

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.012 align:middle line:90%
in an unbiased way.

00:31:23.012 --> 00:31:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we, we don't want
that on the right either.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't want some
right wing think tank

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.980 align:middle line:84%
to tell us what is
news and what is not,

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.010 align:middle line:84%
so why would we want the
left wing version of that?

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: You don't want
Steve Bannon's group

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
basically censoring
the news any more

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.110 align:middle line:84%
than Brock, who is a super PAC
donor for the Democratic party.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAMAN: Exactly.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Why should fact-checking
be a political thing?

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Exactly.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:90%
It should not be politicized.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
obviously, the key

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
how do we survive.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Also even in this
administration,

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what's going
to come as far as utilizing

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.080 align:middle line:84%
censorship as a tool
basically to silence

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:90%
the dissident voices.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.950 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it's like people
talk about how America

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.310 align:middle line:84%
is more divided maybe since
going back to the Civil Rights

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:84%
era, the Civil War, people are
talking about this very divided

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.572 align:middle line:84%
climate as though
it's a bad thing.

00:32:06.572 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Don't you agree
maybe actually this

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what we do need?

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
We do need divisions
that we can actually

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:84%
start to recognize that
we don't have a consensus

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.650 align:middle line:84%
reality, that there are, that
we in order to get at truth,

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.300 align:middle line:84%
you have to sometimes
divide, you have to question,

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.175 align:middle line:84%
you have to challenge,
you have to be at odds

00:32:19.175 --> 00:32:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and polarize in order to
find a new middle ground

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:22.828 align:middle line:90%
or a new reality?

00:32:22.828 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAMAN: Yeah, well, let's look
at what's actually happened.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:84%
The "Washington Post"
is a great example,

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.620 align:middle line:84%
because you had this
brand that people trusted.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And really, the brand
was trusted because

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of the work of
individuals years ago,

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:84%
the former editor in chief,
Katharine Graham I believe

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:90%
was not terrible.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.447 align:middle line:84%
And you go back further,
Woodward and Bernstein.

00:32:40.447 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
people trust the "Washington

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Post" is that that was the
banner that broke Watergate

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:46.760 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And they've been coasting on
that popularity and that trust

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.010 align:middle line:84%
for 30 years and
they've abused it.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.065 align:middle line:84%
And I think this has happened
in different areas of society,

00:32:55.065 --> 00:32:55.865 align:middle line:90%
not just the media.

00:32:55.865 --> 00:32:56.757 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:56.757 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's right.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.200 align:middle line:84%
How did you know
about the possibility

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
of social media, its importance,
fake news, censorship?

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.650 align:middle line:90%
How did you pick that up?

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:90%
You were way ahead of yourself.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Yeah, I mean I guess
I always play things out

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:84%
to the extreme in
my head in a way.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not difficult
when you understand again,

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:90%
go back to the beginning.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.200 align:middle line:84%
We know there are
people that are trying

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:90%
to control other human beings.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question.

00:33:23.485 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Population control is
not just about birth control,

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:84%
it's actually controlling
the population of a planet.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:36.230 align:middle line:84%
It's energy, communication,
food, defense, weaponry.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.540 align:middle line:84%
These are basic things
that these planners have

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and the "New World Order" book
that I wrote is about this.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So I always
understood that there

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.630 align:middle line:84%
was an agenda, an end game
that they were playing towards.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
getting closer.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
As I said in the video, you have
to come to a new understanding

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:51.780 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The reality that you think
is consensus reality and safe

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:90%
is not so.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aside from
demonstrating and rioting

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.208 align:middle line:84%
and protesting, how
do we stop this?

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: I love protests.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm someone that
always loved protests.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a fan of rioting and
destroying private property,

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:90%
small businesses.

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.639 align:middle line:90%
This is horrible.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.929 align:middle line:84%
But seeing people
protest, seeing

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.389 align:middle line:84%
people stand up
and demonstrate, I

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:84%
think that's a powerful
message and it's

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.980 align:middle line:90%
part of the consciousness.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Now what do we do?

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:84%
We keep doing what
we're doing, George.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.590 align:middle line:84%
We have to just keep
sending the messages,

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.489 align:middle line:84%
because people are
picking it up and looking

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:27.447 align:middle line:90%
at alternative sources.

00:34:27.447 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Because step by step, they're
realizing that the mainstream

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.471 align:middle line:90%
is designed to lie to them.

00:34:32.471 --> 00:34:33.679 align:middle line:90%
The mainstream has an agenda.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream
media has an agenda.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it intentional?

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Absolutely.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think so.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Absolutely
it's intentional,

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.442 align:middle line:84%
absolutely it's
controlled narrative.

00:34:40.442 --> 00:34:42.170 align:middle line:84%
For four years, I
don't care whether you

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.469 align:middle line:84%
like Trump or not, I don't
comment on his character,

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:49.022 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen the media attack
a president every single day

00:34:49.022 --> 00:34:49.980 align:middle line:90%
of his administration--

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.389 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: --With such vitriol.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.644 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
indicative and very dangerous.

00:34:53.644 --> 00:34:54.769 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was exhausting.

00:34:54.769 --> 00:34:56.989 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Very exhausting
and very programmatic,

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's unhealthy when
you can't even hear someone

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and at least say, I can comment
and say I agree with this

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.670 align:middle line:90%
and I disagree with that.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.210 align:middle line:84%
You can't even have the
decency to at least make

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:90%
a logical, rational comment.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:90%
It purely is emotional vitriol.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:84%
There's something
wrong in the media.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:84%
It's become, it's become
blogging, it's become pundits,

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:21.290 align:middle line:84%
it has no character of
unbiased, hey, there's

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:84%
an argument, a point
to be made here

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
counter argument.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.775 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
need to be going.

00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:84%
We need to have
balanced arguments.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the old news days
when Walter Cronkite would give

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.280 align:middle line:90%
us balanced news, that's gone.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I'm not,
and Cronkite himself,

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.400 align:middle line:84%
he again, he was
part of an instrument

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.817 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about from the
beginning of mainstream media,

00:35:39.817 --> 00:35:43.160 align:middle line:84%
the major networks, a
small group of networks.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
To this day, six corporations
control the news.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Majority, 90% of media
is six corporations.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a very small people
that collectively give you

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:51.920 align:middle line:90%
the worldview.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Cronkite's worldview I don't
think was anywhere near 100%

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:57.950 align:middle line:84%
accurate, but at
least as you say,

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.560 align:middle line:84%
there was a little bit
more of a pretense of hey,

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:90%
let's give two perspectives.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.130 align:middle line:90%
At least you felt that.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.463 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then you decide.

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: That's the
way PBS was supposed

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.060 align:middle line:90%
to be there for that reason.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: Over a
stretch of time, it's

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:10%
like you just see that
it becomes complete bias.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:10%
Fox has its bias,
CNN has its bias,

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:10%
but overall there's
an agenda at work

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:10%
and it is not the agenda
of actually empowering

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.860 align:middle line:10%
the American people.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.920 align:middle line:10%
The American people, just like
every people on the planet,

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:10%
can be empowered by being
given some information

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.222 align:middle line:10%
and then being told, think for
yourself, decide for yourself.

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:33.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the most, that's the
most powerful thing you can do.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.687 align:middle line:84%
Don't give a man fish,
teach him how to fish.

00:36:36.687 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know some
people who are so

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.240 align:middle line:84%
influenced by what they see
on the media, what they hear

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.000 align:middle line:84%
on the media, what they
see on social media,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.560 align:middle line:84%
that they will believe
anything they see.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: True.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.162 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
think for themselves.

00:36:49.162 --> 00:36:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It's hypnosis.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they want
to talk about cults

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and you know, this
cult and that cult.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
exactly what it is.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:55.682 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I think CNN or Fox,
I think they're cults too.

00:36:55.682 --> 00:36:58.190 align:middle line:84%
If you only, if you follow
that passively and you receive

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that information and then
you regurgitate that,

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:90%
you're just a cultist.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:02.930 align:middle line:90%
You're not thinking.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:04.305 align:middle line:84%
You're not, you're
just receiving

00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:05.425 align:middle line:90%
and then regurgitating.

00:37:05.425 --> 00:37:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sean, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It's a pleasure.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Enlightening.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:14.010 align:middle line:10%
His poems, the documentaries,
but more importantly,

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:17.720 align:middle line:10%
he's trying to send you a
message to think for yourself.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, thanks for
watching "Beyond Belief."
