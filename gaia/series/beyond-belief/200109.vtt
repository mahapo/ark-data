00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.167 align:middle line:90%
George Noory with you.

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:29.320 align:middle line:10%
And our special guest
is Clifford Carnicom.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:10%
He's the founder and president
of the Carnicom Institute.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is a
not-for-profit research

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and educational
organization that

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.715 align:middle line:84%
is devoted to environmental
and health-related issues.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:43.300 align:middle line:84%
His professional career
includes advanced research

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and development in the
science of geodesy--

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and we'll tell you
about that in a moment--

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
with the Department of
Defense under a very

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.400 align:middle line:90%
top secret clearance.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Top secret, so can you
tell us everything?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD CARNICOM: No,
but the general principles

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:84%
can come out, one
way or another.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clifford,
what is geodesy?

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:10%
>>CARNICOM: Geodesy is a
science that actually has it's--

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:10%
well, it goes back to
the beginning of time.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:10%
But it was developed in
the 1800s more fully.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:10%
And it has to do with
the study of the Earth.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.810 align:middle line:10%
And it covers three main
fields of the Earth.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:10%
One would be the size
and shape of the earth.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's in a very
detailed, comprehensive,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:84%
three-dimensional
sense, not just a ball.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And the second would be what we
call satellite geodesy, which

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
would have to do with all
the dynamics of spacecraft,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and orbital mechanics,
and that type of thing.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And the third part
would be a study

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
of the gravitational field,
three-dimensional modeling

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.275 align:middle line:84%
of the gravitational
field of the Earth.

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
field that I was--

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: --most involved with
was the gravitational modeling.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically the
geophysical aspects

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth as
well as geometric.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What we know of the
planet, and what we're told,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.765 align:middle line:90%
are they two different things?

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Well, it depends on
what scale you're talking of.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:84%
That's a very physical,
mathematical, astronomical

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So these sciences are
very deeply rooted,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
have deeply
conventional history.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:90%
That needs to be understood.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
solid, real science.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the background that
I come from is primarily

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:90%
a scientific background.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I am curious about most
everything in the world.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that the
world is full of mysteries--

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah!

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: --in
many, many ways.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
very important to,

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
also, connect with the
history before us and the work

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:84%
that people have done
before us, to prepare us,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
along the conventional
lines, so that we're

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.827 align:middle line:84%
able to accept new information
that comes in our time.

00:02:37.827 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got
you into this field?

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.118 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't wake
up as a little boy

00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:84%
and say, this is what I'm
going to do when I grow up!

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: When I
first got into school,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:90%
I actually was an art major.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.677 align:middle line:90%
So my mind is a little bit--

00:02:47.677 --> 00:02:48.477 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Yeah, my
mind is a little bit,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
let's say, diverse, in
terms of what interests me.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.562 align:middle line:84%
But I've also always had,
also, an intuitive involvement

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and appeal with the
world of mathematics.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:90%
It's very pure form to me.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I think music and
mathematics are

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
two of the purest
forms of communication,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.407 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, in the
existence in the cosmos.

00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I've always
been drawn to that.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And one makes choices
about their career path.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, I
realized the art world

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
was going to have
its own complications

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and difficulties of, let's
say, how to make a livelihood.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So I took my talents
in the hard sciences,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:90%
is what it amounts to.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.095 align:middle line:84%
But also, because I had an
intuitive appeal to them

00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:38.895 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Geoengineering,
which is a phrase

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.315 align:middle line:84%
we hear all the time,
but exactly what is that?

00:03:45.315 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Yeah, it's a
phrase that's actually,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
it's been coined to try and
fit a set of circumstances that

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:90%
have developed in our lifetime.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, the term has, to me, taken
on a very limited definition

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:90%
in the public sphere.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:84%
You can now find
academic programs

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
in the field of geoengineering.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a fairly new evolution
in terms of science.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
The definition of that field
is highly restrictive, to me,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and is not reflective
of, really,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.069 align:middle line:84%
what the totality of that word
means, if we look at a word.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:84%
That definition,
as I understand it,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.785 align:middle line:84%
as it has propagated through
the academic, and political,

00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and media circles, is restricted
to the study of, basically,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.870 align:middle line:84%
controlling heat
flow into the earth.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
The issue of global warming
and reflecting solar radiation

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
is how that word is
classically framed now,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:90%
in all ways to the public.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
This is how the
public, I think, is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:90%
intended to perceive that word.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
That is not what that word
means to me as I take it

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
by its root, root
meaning, as well as

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.810 align:middle line:90%
what I see in my research.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so what
does it mean to you?

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Well, you take
those two words together.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.505 align:middle line:84%
You start with engineering,
and you start with geo,

00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:90%
and you dissect those.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Engineering is a
very broad science.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And in general, in
general, engineering,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:90%
it's the development of systems.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not a specific program.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the development of systems.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Those systems are
usually very technical.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:90%
They're usually very complex.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And there is even
the word of savviness

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that goes with
engineering, to come up

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:84%
with a clever way of
solving a problem.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:90%
This is what makes it unique.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And engineering is
applied to, literally,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:84%
any type of building, any
kind of system that we

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:90%
see in our world.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:84%
If you now couple that
word with the word

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:84%
geo, which means Earth, this
is what that word means.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.410 align:middle line:84%
This word means,
in my definition--

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:84%
this definition is not readily
accepted by the public.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's very real, in
terms of what is happening--

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
development of systems

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:84%
applications through
almost any means

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:84%
imaginable, involving
creativity, technology,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:84%
ingenuity, systems of
control, and manipulation,

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:84%
applied to the Earth,
the Earth as a whole,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.790 align:middle line:84%
not a specific single
part of Earth dynamics

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this a
good thing for us?

00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: It could
be either, right?

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: It can be either.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:90%
What can we do with technology?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
What can we do with
the human mind?

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
We can do whatever our
creativity allows us to do.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to be evil,
and it allows us to be good.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The work that I have become
involved in, and, to me,

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
there is no question
that it involves

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
the application of exactly
what I'm speaking of,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
systems of technology
towards the Earth.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give me an example.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Give me an example.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: All right,
so weather control

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.315 align:middle line:90%
is one of these, all right?

00:06:52.315 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll go through all--

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a list of seven, if
I can remember them all.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: This topic of
geoengineering is generally

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
perceived and phrased simply
in the sphere of weather

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and potentially
weather modification,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.295 align:middle line:84%
a soft and diplomatic word,
versus weather control having

00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
more of a direct
application or even --

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That sounds a
little more evil, doesn't it?

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: At least
military connotations,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:90%
without any doubt.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.937 align:middle line:84%
I have a list of seven
areas of application

00:07:20.937 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:90%
that have evolved since my work.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.608 align:middle line:90%
And that has not changed.

00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see if I can remember
at least a good portion

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:84%
The first one, first of
all, I call it environmental

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.325 align:middle line:90%
control rather than weather.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Weather is a part of an
environmental control.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But environmental control means
the entire environment, not

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:90%
just weather.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not just weather.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Not
just weather, OK?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's number
one to begin with,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that already basically
dispels my acceptance

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
of that limited definition
that is commonly perceived.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.112 align:middle line:84%
Second would be
military operations, OK?

00:07:50.112 --> 00:07:52.195 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have to go through
them briefly because--

00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, that could be huge.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.165 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Every
one of these is huge.

00:07:55.165 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Every one of-- a third one would
be electromagnetic operations,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And each of these is an entire
field of discussion in itself.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.518 align:middle line:84%
And anything that
I'm speaking of

00:08:07.518 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:84%
is concluded to result
directly from evidence

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that I have acquired and
gained over the years.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Another one would be that
of biological activity, OK?

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And yes, there are--

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.552 align:middle line:84%
it's fair to say, there are
nefarious aspects potential

00:08:23.552 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:90%
within each one of these, OK?

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: That's true.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But the first point is
to be aware of them.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
start to examine

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:90%
what the applications might be.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:90%
So we're at biological.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Next would be
surveillance applications.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
There are surveillance
applications

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.443 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the evidence
that's available to us.

00:08:42.443 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Another would be,
literally, geophysical.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
geodesy a little bit

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and how you're dealing with the
scale of the Earth as a whole.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
There are potentially
geophysical applications

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
of the technologies
that we're seeing,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:84%
such as tectonics,
this type of thing,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
global storm systems,
this type of thing.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one is
a little bit more exotic.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet it has to be
included in the list.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is since,
basically, our atmosphere

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:90%
has been modified.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.030 align:middle line:90%
We will have to accept--

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
question about in your mind.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: There is absolutely
no question about that.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And within that
atmospheric modification,

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
a more sophisticated application
would be what I call--

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I call it the detection of
exotic propulsion systems.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the phrase I use.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:84%
What we're saying there is that
if you have an altered medium,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and if it's been in an ionic
condition, which we could talk

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:84%
about more, is
existing within that,

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
changes of the
electrically-charged state

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:84%
of that atmosphere
and detection of those

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.915 align:middle line:84%
could be another
interesting application.

00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:84%
This is a little
bit more exotic.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:90%
The others are fundamental.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:84%
We could talk about
them for hours.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
I can certainly

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:84%
envision the value of the
ability to detect changes

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:90%
in the state of that medium.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And that could certainly
involve any type of, basically,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
craft of motion, of anything
that we could possibly imagine.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Former
weathercaster Scott Stevens

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:90%
was on Gaia's "Open Minds" show.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.643 align:middle line:84%
And he is a proponent with
you of geoengineering.

00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: And that
is everyone's pointing--

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:90%
all the newscasts and so forth--

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.777 align:middle line:90%
global climate change.

00:10:23.777 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Global climate change is
responsible for these patterns.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are some insane
patterns, like I mentioned.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:84%
However, virtually
none of them talk

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
about geoengineering and global
climate change having anything

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
to do with quote,
"geoengineering," the less

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:90%
polite term, "chemtrailing."

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have
that conversation.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:10%
No one can talk intelligently
about that phenomena

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.552 align:middle line:10%
unless they address
geoengineering, right?

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT STEVENS: It's
like having an apple pie.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:90%
And that was a great apple pie.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.447 align:middle line:90%
But there was no apples in it.

00:10:59.447 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: This key
ingredient, this key factor

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:90%
is not being discussed.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, even Al Gore
talks about geoengineering,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and its reality,
and the need for it.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the actual
implications of it happening

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:18.730 align:middle line:84%
around the globe over thousands
of miles, hundreds of thousands

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
of miles of territory,
back and forth,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.455 align:middle line:90%
no one will talk about it.

00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that was
our own Regina Meredith

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:90%
from Gaia's "Open Minds."

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting, wasn't it?

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: It is.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:84%
To me, there are three levels
that need to be discussed here.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
One would be there is a formal
acknowledgment of the term

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:90%
engineering.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, there
are now academic programs.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And they are restricted to
that very specific sphere

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned of
solar radiation control.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
The second context in which
that term is being used

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
is what is called geoengineering
in the sense of, call it,

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
extreme harsh
pollution in our world

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:90%
that we're not talking about.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:90%
That's the second level.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
The third level is
the list of seven

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.025 align:middle line:84%
that I gave you of which no one
is speaking of at that level.

00:12:03.025 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're afraid to.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.317 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: They think it
would be an accomplishment

00:12:06.317 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
to speak about geoengineering
in terms of weather control.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying the real
world says that we

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
have an entire sphere
of a minimum of seven

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.138 align:middle line:84%
major global applications
that everything

00:12:18.138 --> 00:12:19.180 align:middle line:90%
says that they're active.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:84%
This is not
hypothetical whatsoever.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything says that
these are active programs.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So the discussion, even within
the context presented there,

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:84%
is not nearly as broad as
it eventually needs to be.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clifford, do you think
the public would freak out

00:12:33.615 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:84%
if they knew about these
different things that were

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:90%
happening with geoengineering?

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: There
are people that they

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.870 align:middle line:90%
do live a life based in fear.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:90%
I can't speak for others.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I have to follow my
own sense of truth.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have to be
responsible for myself.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.745 align:middle line:84%
And I attempt to be
responsible in my life.

00:12:54.745 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I have no desire, no motive
whatsoever to introduce

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:90%
sensationalism into this issue.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I have no motive whatsoever to
introduce fear into this issue.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I do have the need, and the
desire, and the obligation,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and the responsibility
to introduce the evidence

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:90%
that I know exists.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
My standards are those of what
I regard as a court of law,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
anything that I-- and
also the rules of science.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I need to be able to
present that evidence.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:84%
We must deal with
the world as it

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:84%
is, not as we wish it to be, or
try to ignore things that might

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:84%
have an impact because
we are subject to it,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
whether we wish to
admit it or not.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:84%
We are subject to
our world around us.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:90%
And we are participants in it.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So whether or not we're worried
about fear, from my side,

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
is irrelevant in the sense
that we must confront the world

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we
are the participants.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones that affect
the world, not someone

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:90%
else directing us.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This planet,
Cliff, is so huge.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:84%
They actually can
control and manipulate?

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: Well.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As big
as this planet is?

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: We
know that the world

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.831 align:middle line:84%
is changing in terms of its
sense of scale in our lives.

00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:09.631 align:middle line:90%
And the world is--

00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's getting smaller.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: (CHUCKLING) Look,
we can say the world's small.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:84%
But we can also look at in
an entirely different way.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're at the point where
every square inch on this world

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:90%
is accounted for in some way.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
We're at the place where
every single human being is

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:90%
accounted for on this world.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that I would
accept that it's so small.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
As our understanding
of our place increases,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
we realize we are one small
place in a much bigger place.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And we need to respect that,
that we are not dominions

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:90%
of the entire cosmos, OK?

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Synthetic biology
is an important factor

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.520 align:middle line:90%
in all of this.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:10%
>> 20 years ago,
scientists learned to read

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:10%
a creature's entire DNA
sequence, beginning to end.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:10%
A genome, it's called.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:10%
They did this for simple
things, like bacteria, and then

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:10.870 align:middle line:10%
for more complex flies,
and eventually for humans.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:10%
And then they began to
tinker, to take the glow

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:10%
from a jellyfish, and
transfer it to a cat,

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:10%
to make critters do what
they'd never done before.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.950 align:middle line:10%
And as biologists
got better at this,

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.390 align:middle line:10%
says Stanford professor Drew
Endy, a new kind of science

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:10%
was born.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:10%
>>DREW ENDY: It's called
synthetic biology.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:10%
It's a means to an end.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:10%
>> What can we do with the new
tools of synthetic biology?

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:10%
Well, we can improve on
what's been spelled out

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:10%
over 3 billion
years of evolution.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:10%
We can take it beyond reading
genomes or editing genomes

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:10%
and start writing genomes, our
own ideas of what life should

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:10%
be like, making
creatures drastically

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.102 align:middle line:10%
different from any
that have ever existed.

00:16:01.102 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:10%
And how do you do that?

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:10%
Well, already, one
group of scientists

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:10%
have rewritten and rebuilt
the entire instruction

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:10%
kit for the very
humble, little yeast.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.402 align:middle line:10%
And they plan to put their
new recipe into a cell.

00:16:15.402 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:10%
And if everything goes
according to plan,

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.875 align:middle line:10%
it will come alive and begin
making baby yeast, exactly

00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:10%
like its most unusual parent.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:10%
It will be new in the world.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:10%
This synthetic yeast will
break the continuous chain

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:10%
of evolution that links
every creature back

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:10%
to the first living cell.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:47.585 align:middle line:10%
It will be discontinuous, in
a way a thing unto itself.

00:16:47.585 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:10%


00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:10%
And then where do we
take this new technology?

00:16:54.330 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:10%
How far should we or will we go?

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.868 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think of
that explanation we just saw?

00:17:03.868 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: I think
that's, actually,

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
a very well presented video
on a very important topic.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And that subject is that
we are on the threshold

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:84%
of a complete change
in terms of our ability

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
to interact and manipulate
life and biological processes.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:84%
There is a term called
CRISPR that's come out

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:90%
over the last few years.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't make claims to
be in a genetic scientist.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But I study enough to know
the general principles.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And many of us are aware of
the idea of gene splicing

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and modifying,
genetically-modified organisms,

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.000 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.750 align:middle line:90%
But this term CRISPR applies--

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:84%
really, the image is
that of a word processor.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:84%
We know what it's like to
take what a word processor is

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:84%
compared to our time
on the typewriter,

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and cutting a snip
out of something,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and moving around, and
making anything you want.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
We are at this point
with genetic ability now.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The CRISPR technology
allows for, basically,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.885 align:middle line:90%
cut and paste of genetic code.

00:18:07.885 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
kind of dangerous

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:90%
though, Clifford, isn't it?

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: It truly is a brave
new world because the question

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:90%
is do we have--

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:90%
are we responsible?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Are we responsible enough to
be able to manage and handle

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
that kind of
information properly?

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.775 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, history
says we're not, OK?

00:18:26.775 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:28.885 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: Human beings--

00:18:28.885 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're not capable.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: --can claim
a element of knowledge.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But they cannot
historically show the level

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of responsibility that goes
along with that to manage that

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear weaponry would be a
classic example of this, OK?

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Our environmental damage
would be a classic example.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:84%
These operations that are
taking place in our planet

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
right now, which encompass
all seven of those fields,

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:90%
they are of the same ilk, OK?

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.421 align:middle line:84%
There is no demonstrated
responsibility

00:18:57.421 --> 00:19:01.465 align:middle line:84%
of our means to understand the
impact of what we're actually

00:19:01.465 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:90%
doing to our planet.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think the video
is very important.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's directly
relevant in my work

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.038 align:middle line:84%
because I mentioned to you
the biological aspect, right?

00:19:11.038 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As one of those seven.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: The
biological aspect is huge.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
It is a very uncomfortable topic
for many of us to speak about.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But once again, we must confront
the evidence that exists.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence
demonstrates that there

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:84%
has been the dispersion
of a basically, honestly,

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:90%
a new form of life.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
An entire new arena
of microbiology

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
has been distributed
upon this planet.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Or let us say, it has taken
hold on this planet at a level

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:84%
that many of us could not
even begin to imagine it.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It literally exists.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:90%
You could put out--

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I could put out a good
quality air filter,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:84%
probably anyplace
on this planet.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect I would be
able to produce evidence

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:84%
of a microbial nature
that should astonish us,

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
if we actually look
into this field.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And the behavior,
and characteristics,

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:84%
morphology of this
particular microbe

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
pose those very
same questions that

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
are raised in this video of,
are we dealing, potentially,

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:84%
with a synthetic form of life,
or at least something that,

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:84%
let's say, crosses the
norms of how biology

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:90%
is classified on this planet?

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
conventional science comes in,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.655 align:middle line:84%
that we must become familiar
with it, study what that is.

00:20:37.655 --> 00:20:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And in that world,
it's based upon what

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:84%
are called domains of life,
that those domains of life

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
are determined by
genetic origin.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:84%
You now have to contrast that
against available information

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.370 align:middle line:84%
of a microbial form
that does not seem

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:90%
to fit well into that system.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
fundamental problem

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.140 align:middle line:84%
when you violate
the basic foundation

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
of biological classification
as it is established now.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It should be raising
all kinds of questions

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:84%
about, why are we
not investigating?

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Why are we not
taking this to heart

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.430 align:middle line:90%
if the evidence is before us?

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Why are we ignoring
the evidence?

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Why are we not
acknowledging the evidence?

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm telling
you that it is there.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:22.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are we doing
this bioengineering?

00:21:22.045 --> 00:21:25.202 align:middle line:84%
What are we trying
to accomplish here?

00:21:25.202 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: There's always
different directions

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I can take in terms of
an answer to a question.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say that any one is
necessarily the single answer.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.605 align:middle line:84%
One answer, not even an
answer, but one attribute--

00:21:37.605 --> 00:21:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I see human beings
as being really

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.180 align:middle line:84%
a most curious species
as I look at them from--

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:90%
I study history too.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
evolution of the human race.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that marks the human race

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is that we, basically,
fuss with anything

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.570 align:middle line:90%
we can get our hands on.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And alter
and manipulate.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: We will do
anything we can possibly

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.670 align:middle line:90%
imagine is what it amounts to.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.938 align:middle line:84%
The idea of science fiction,
as I was growing up,

00:22:01.938 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:84%
you have this idea
of science fiction

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.650 align:middle line:84%
as something that's impossible,
something that is removed.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
As I have grown and aged, I
have come to the conclusion

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:17.015 align:middle line:84%
that if any single human being
can imagine, not necessarily

00:22:17.015 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
even produce,
imagine anything, it

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
is within the sphere of
consideration and possibility

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:90%
of occurring, OK?

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And this applies to anything
and everything we speak of.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of them would certainly
include the desire to control,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.158 align:middle line:84%
manipulate, and thus even
quote, "create" life.

00:22:36.158 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What could go
wrong in doing that?

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: Everything.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:39.975 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: Absolutely.

00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Well, it's
just a fact, right?

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And has it
gone wrong already,

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.340 align:middle line:90%
and we just don't know about it?

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: We don't know
enough because, unfortunately, I

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:84%
do not have a network of
what I would call dedicated

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:84%
professionals willing to commit
themselves to the problems

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
before us, to truly assess the
scope and impact of what it is

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.670 align:middle line:84%
that exists before us with
this alteration of life

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
When I'm speaking
of microbial life,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:84%
this microbial life is
affecting our existence, OK?

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no way it can be denied.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:90%
It is affecting our life.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.080 align:middle line:84%
It's affecting all
life on this planet,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and how you can let
something sit like that, OK?

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:84%
How can you ignore that
evidence which exists?

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Are you even willing to
look at the evidence?

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Because how can you
answer your question

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:84%
of what the impact
is unless you even

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:90%
know what you're working with?

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And right now, that work is
contained within, basically,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:84%
a set of notebooks that I
have accumulated and developed

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:84%
over the last 20 years that
are a record of my work.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the only place that I
know that that problem is being

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:84%
addressed correctly,
the best way that I can,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.860 align:middle line:90%
as a single individual.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that I have the
capacity, even the talent,

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and the skill to address the
entire scope of problems that

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:13.800 align:middle line:84%
is inherent in the claim
of a new form of biology

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.860 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, that
affects all life, including

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:90%
the human species?

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
an old saying, it's

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:84%
not good to play around
with Mother Nature.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I think that may be true.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Well,
let's just say, I can--

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.390 align:middle line:84%
well, you can get off into
spiritual discussions.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say, I am in awe.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I am in awe, throughout
my entire life,

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.820 align:middle line:84%
at the world of nature
around me, entirely in awe.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by being in awe,
is that what God has given us?

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Or is that what
we have given it?

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Oh, no, we
are not the gifters.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: No, no,
we're screaming,

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.615 align:middle line:90%
babbling kids in the crib.

00:24:57.615 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we playing
around with something

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:90%
a little too dangerous.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: We are
playing around with things

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that we do not have the
ability to even comprehend

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:90%
the full impact.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:84%
We never, never will
have the capacity

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
to understand the full
impact of that which

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:90%
exists in this universe, never.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.137 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
we know, Clifford,

00:25:20.137 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that this manipulation,
this bioengineering,

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:84%
this whatever they're
doing to the planet

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:84%
isn't affecting us with some new
diseases, and new things that

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:90%
are happening?

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: Well, it is.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.960 align:middle line:84%
There is a term
called Morgellons.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I didn't create the term.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It has come into existence,
and it has a problem.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
The term has a problem in that
if language is not sanctioned

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:84%
by those that have the
means to control, basically,

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
the structure of
language, basically, then

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:90%
the term is not accepted.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Morgellons is a term that
has evolved to describe

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:90%
a new disease in our world, OK?

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I started getting
calls years ago on the radio

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
show "Coast to
Coast" from people

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:90%
talking about Morgellons.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.983 align:middle line:84%
And initially, I'd say,
what the heck is this?

00:26:15.983 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But then they would
talk about it,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.983 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
have you explain what

00:26:18.983 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:90%
this disease apparently is.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But they were talking
about little fibers

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:84%
growing out of their arms, and
feeling like there were insects

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:90%
crawling under their skin.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is this thing?

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: The term is
applied to a condition which

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:90%
does exist.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:90%
It is real.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The term, the name was
given by a citizen.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
is not accepted.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.660 align:middle line:84%
There is no formal acceptance
of the condition or disease,

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:90%
whatever we wish to call it.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So it exists in
this ambiguous state

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that there's a lot of evidence
to say that it's real.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And I would go beyond
the point of a lot.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.720 align:middle line:84%
The evidence is clear
what is happening here.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.553 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's there.

00:26:58.553 --> 00:26:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: OK, there is.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And it ties in directly with
the microbial discoveries

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:90%
that I am speaking of--

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: --that have
occurred in my research.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So there is no
formal acceptance.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it's so poorly--

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a denial?

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Oh, it's
more than denial.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.057 align:middle line:90%
Lives are being destroyed.

00:27:19.057 --> 00:27:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Lives are being destroyed.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:90%
A person will go to a doctor.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
They will show
physical symptoms.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:84%
These symptoms are
quite real, OK?

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:90%
We're not imagining.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I have spent years studying
the so-called filaments

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.355 align:middle line:90%
that we're speaking of, OK?

00:27:34.355 --> 00:27:37.073 align:middle line:84%
I will claim to know
the source of this.

00:27:37.073 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They are
growing out of people.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.762 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: This is
a real condition.

00:27:40.762 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:84%
It's physical, and the
samples can be produced.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And I can produce
them in more ways

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:84%
than you would
want to know about.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But the general scenario
that happens over, and over,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and over is someone seeks
medical help or treatment.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is they are
classified as being delusional.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:90%
I have heard many cases.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is the norm.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.360 align:middle line:90%
This is not the exception.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:84%
There are many cases I've heard
of where they will be presented

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.160 align:middle line:90%
with physical evidence.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And it simply will
not be accepted.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They won't take it.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: There is even
a distance being kept, OK?

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.190 align:middle line:90%
It will not be examined.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I can show you very simple
things under the microscope.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:20.537 align:middle line:84%
There is no, no excuse for not
a direct observation of start

00:28:20.537 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:90%
with the microscope.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:84%
We can go on from there
into all kinds of work.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:90%
But start with the microscope.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
You can not excuse
that, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's there.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: But it is not done.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And that person--
the history is there,

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:84%
for any of us that
wish to look at it.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.645 align:middle line:84%
These folks are labeled
as being delusional, OK?

00:28:36.645 --> 00:28:37.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And kooks.

00:28:37.445 --> 00:28:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: And they
are suffering, OK?

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And none of us are removed from
this prospect of suffering.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Many are suffering.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:57.240 align:middle line:84%
My small nonprofit has received
well over a dozen offers

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.850 align:middle line:84%
of people trying to
give me their body, OK?

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.585 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea how much
these people are suffering, OK?

00:29:02.585 --> 00:29:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
that frustrated.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle line:10%
>>CARNICOM: OK, and I have
no capacity whatsoever

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.640 align:middle line:10%
to even begin to address.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:10%
This is a people
offering their body.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:10%
I have hundreds, hundreds
of the suffering.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.120 align:middle line:90%
You can not imagine, OK?

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.760 align:middle line:90%
We can not excuse ourselves.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:84%
We can not play the
game of language,

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and delusion, and
avoidance, and denial.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.222 align:middle line:84%
We can not do that and live in
any good conscience whatsoever.

00:29:30.222 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yet we're doing that

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: And I don't know
when that time is coming.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But we have no excuse
for it whatsoever.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cliff, "NBC News" did
a pretty comprehensive report

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:90%
on Morgellons.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.105 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:29:42.105 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:10%
>> What's it like to feel
certain that you're sick,

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.980 align:middle line:10%
really, truly sick, and
have doctors tell you,

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:10%
it's all in your mind?

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.810 align:middle line:10%
>>KATIE YUSSUF: I
woke up itching.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:10%
I thought there was
mites in my skin, which

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.050 align:middle line:10%
is the creepiest feeling.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:10%
When I first was
looking at my sores,

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:09.315 align:middle line:10%
I could see projections
coming out of them.

00:30:09.315 --> 00:30:13.170 align:middle line:10%
A little bit of color
like I'm super healthy.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.700 align:middle line:10%
I'm sick with this disease.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.720 align:middle line:10%
It's called Morgellons,
and it's really weird.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:10%
No one believes it.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Morgellons, a
mysterious infection that,

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:10%
according to some researchers,
affects tens of thousands

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:10%
of Americans.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.420 align:middle line:10%
Its symptoms are strange
and otherworldly,

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:10%
enormous skin lesions with
multicolored fibers of red,

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:10%
and blue, and green
growing out of them.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: I remember when I
first heard about Morgellons.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.710 align:middle line:10%
But I didn't believe it.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want to have
something controversial.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to have something
that has existed before,

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.270 align:middle line:10%
has an answer.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:52.055 align:middle line:10%
But all my searches kept coming
right back to Morgellons.

00:30:52.055 --> 00:30:54.810 align:middle line:10%
>> But here's the thing,
according to the Centers

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:56.700 align:middle line:10%
for Disease Control
and Prevention,

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.710 align:middle line:10%
Morgellons does not exist.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.570 align:middle line:10%
Many doctors believe
that Morgellons

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:02.790 align:middle line:10%
is a delusional
disorder, that those skin

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:06.315 align:middle line:10%
lesions, like the ones that
Katie has, are self-inflicted.

00:31:06.315 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: Doctors,
in the beginning,

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.580 align:middle line:10%
thought that I probably
had a mental problem when

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:12.390 align:middle line:10%
I showed up.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.610 align:middle line:10%
They all thought I was nuts.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.580 align:middle line:10%
And they would instantly
just be in the role of,

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.476 align:middle line:10%
begone with her.

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:19.410 align:middle line:10%
We can't help her.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.618 align:middle line:10%
>>KATIE ENGELHART: I guess
the tension in all of this

00:31:21.618 --> 00:31:24.030 align:middle line:10%
is that Morgellons
doesn't officially exist,

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.940 align:middle line:10%
that the CDC says
it doesn't exist.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.280 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: I think it makes
a lot of us a lot more sick,

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:34.535 align:middle line:10%
the anger of being categorized
like that, and then neglected.

00:31:34.535 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:10%
>> One doctor who does treat
hundreds of Morgellons patients

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:10%
is Dr. Raphael Stricker,
who, depending on your view

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.900 align:middle line:10%
of Morgellons, can be
one of several things--

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:10%
a savior, a medical
pioneer, or a quack.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:51.162 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Stricker says Morgellons
is linked to Lyme disease.

00:31:51.162 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:10%
>>RAPHAEL STRICKER:
So these fibers

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.810 align:middle line:10%
that are seen in
Morgellons patients,

00:31:54.810 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:10%
they're not some worms, or lint,
or something from outer space.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:10%
What they are is they're
fibers that are produced

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.120 align:middle line:10%
by the patient's own cells.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.030 align:middle line:10%
And for some reason, these
patients with Lyme disease

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.657 align:middle line:10%
overproduce these fibers.

00:32:10.657 --> 00:32:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
up through the skin

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:90%
and cause these weird lesions.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.050 align:middle line:10%
So the bacteria
that causes Lyme is

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:10%
called a Spirochete, transmitted
by the bite of a tick.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:10%
We've looked at a number
of Morgellons patients.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:10%
The last study, I think,
had 25 patients that

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:10%
had skin lesions with fibers.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:10%
All of the patients,
essentially,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:10%
had infection with
the Lyme bacteria.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:10%
>> But in a 2012 study, the
CDC reported that there was no

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:10%
common underlying medical
condition for Morgellons

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:10%
symptoms, that the fibers found
on patient's skin were mostly

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:44.520 align:middle line:10%
bits of cotton.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:10%
>>STRICKER: Based
on that though,

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.220 align:middle line:10%
they've been very
skeptical about Morgellons.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Stricker says the CDC
study was flawed, in part,

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:10%
because research subjects didn't
have to have Morgellons fibers

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.000 align:middle line:10%
in their skin at the
actual time of the study.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:10%
So maybe they didn't
have Morgellons at all.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.160 align:middle line:10%
>>STRICKER:
Dermatologists who should

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.465 align:middle line:10%
deal with it have
been told, well, this

00:33:04.465 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:10%
isn't a real disease.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:10%
And they're crazy, and
they're delusional,

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:08.850 align:middle line:10%
and that's all it is.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.440 align:middle line:10%
Basically, what
we've been doing is

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.780 align:middle line:10%
showing that that's not
true, that these are

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.790 align:middle line:10%
people who have a real disease.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Marianne Middelveen is
a veterinary microbiologist

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.420 align:middle line:10%
by training.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.420 align:middle line:10%
She conducts research on
Morgellons with Dr. Stricker.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.120 align:middle line:10%
Some of their work is funded
by a Morgellons advocacy

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.525 align:middle line:10%
group called the Charles
E. Holman Foundation.

00:33:26.525 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:10%
>>MARIANNE
MIDDELVEEN: I actually

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:33.830 align:middle line:10%
showed that the lesions
contain the Lyme bacteria.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:10%
The way we determine if a person
has Morgellons or not is we

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.800 align:middle line:10%
look for the presence
of cutaneous filaments

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.915 align:middle line:10%
that are in or
embedded in the skin.

00:33:44.915 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:10%
>>ENGELHART: I can see
some black strands.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.460 align:middle line:10%
But couldn't that have
come off your dress?

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.260 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: Yes.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.302 align:middle line:10%
>>ENGELHART: Couldn't it
have come off the couch?

00:33:53.302 --> 00:33:55.640 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: Absolutely
can, and I think

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.925 align:middle line:10%
that adds to the confusion.

00:33:57.925 --> 00:34:01.090 align:middle line:10%
And it's only after
a long time, you

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:10%
can see it clearly
coming out of the body.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:10%
I never brought in any samples.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:10%
I learned quickly not to
show any pictures either.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:10%
>>ENGELHART: To doctors?

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: Yes, pretty much,
if you bring anything in,

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.639 align:middle line:10%
you can expect a delusional
parasitosis diagnosis.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:23.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Online Morgellons becomes
a kind of subculture.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.280 align:middle line:10%
And Katie has found
friends there.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.901 align:middle line:10%
Two of them decided to
come visit her in Seattle.

00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:31.650 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: Do you want to try
this new active lesion right

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.750 align:middle line:10%
here on my face?

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:38.020 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTHA HUTTON: Yeah.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, show me-- this one?

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.050 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: Mm-hmm.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.670 align:middle line:10%
>>HUTTON: Show me what--
there's nothing really here.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.502 align:middle line:10%
You can't see it in these--
if she tore that off though,

00:34:44.502 --> 00:34:46.060 align:middle line:10%
they would probably be--

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.639 align:middle line:10%
because, yeah, I mean, I've--

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:51.090 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: Because
it's not really open.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:10%
>> With a scope,
you can see them.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:58.348 align:middle line:10%
But you can feel, like when
they're swimming across my eye.

00:34:58.348 --> 00:34:59.640 align:middle line:10%
And then it gets in the corner.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.357 align:middle line:10%
And you can pull this
thing out of your eye.

00:35:01.357 --> 00:35:02.151 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: I still have them--

00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:10%
>> I have those a lot.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.160 align:middle line:10%
>>YUSSUF: --every
day, all day long.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.790 align:middle line:10%
I'll go wash my hands now.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.370 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Yet skeptical doctors
argue that Morgellons is

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.270 align:middle line:10%
a psychiatric condition.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.070 align:middle line:10%
They often diagnose
patients with what they

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:10%
call delusional parasitosis.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.650 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN KOO: Practically every
practicing dermatologist

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:10%
will see Morgellons
disease sooner or later.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.230 align:middle line:10%
And most of the patients who
are affected with Morgellons

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.030 align:middle line:10%
are women.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.830 align:middle line:10%
They are clean.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.960 align:middle line:10%
They don't have any
substance abuse problem.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.930 align:middle line:10%
And out of nowhere, they start
feeling crawling, biting,

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:35.540 align:middle line:10%
stinging sensations.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:10%
And they start becoming very
much worried about parasites.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.120 align:middle line:10%
Many people with Morgellons
go to the dermatologist.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.870 align:middle line:10%
They don't want to
argue with the patient.

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.520 align:middle line:10%
It's very unpleasant against
what the patient is saying.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.830 align:middle line:10%
So oftentimes, one
way to just take

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.820 align:middle line:10%
care of the situation in a
way that the patients are not

00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:00.170 align:middle line:10%
unhappy, no argument, and
they will go home quickly

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:10%
and happily is to
give them antibiotic.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:06.320 align:middle line:10%
Those measures practically
never lead to a cure.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.940 align:middle line:90%
It is commonly done.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say in a way
to get rid of the patient

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.990 align:middle line:90%
from the office.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Sometimes, Dr. Koo gives
these patients a prescription

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.940 align:middle line:10%
for an antipsychotic medication
called pimozide and sends them

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:10%
on their way.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.250 align:middle line:10%
>>KOO: Ideally, there's a
medication called pimozide.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:10%
It's actually a medicine
for Tourette's syndrome.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.860 align:middle line:10%
Pimozide works very
well for these symptoms

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.770 align:middle line:10%
and often lead to great
improvement in symptom

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:31.670 align:middle line:10%
if not cure.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whoa, what do you
think of that explanation.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: I wasn't
picking up all that

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.232 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the language.

00:36:35.232 --> 00:36:36.500 align:middle line:90%
But I picked up part of it.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm hearing the notion
of giving a prescription

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.430 align:middle line:90%
to try and--

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To alter someone's--

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: --to
alleviate, in any way,

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.840 align:middle line:84%
mitigate or alleviate
this situation,

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, at this point, it
doesn't cut it whatsoever,

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.570 align:middle line:90%
not even close.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.380 align:middle line:84%
If we understand the impact,
are willing to understand

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.810 align:middle line:84%
the impact of this
microbiology upon our body,

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:84%
it can be interpreted
as none other than

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:84%
a complete, full assault on
the major systems of the body.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Our medical system,
unfortunately,

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.080 align:middle line:84%
the prescriptions, many
of us know this now,

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.760 align:middle line:90%
but they do not fix problems.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course not.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.560 align:middle line:90%
They mask it.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: They never are
intended to fix a problem,

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:84%
even if you try to make
the claim, all right?

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.460 align:middle line:84%
They are to work
with the symptoms.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Those people that are
willing to get closer

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.610 align:middle line:84%
to the origin and
source of a cause

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.610 align:middle line:84%
of a problem in our health
are those that are on track.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:84%
The nutritionists have a great
deal of respect in my life.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.450 align:middle line:84%
But I know that the
systems of the body

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.670 align:middle line:84%
are under assault
here, major systems.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It will include the thyroid,
the blood, the neural system,

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.270 align:middle line:90%
cognitive systems, the joint.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Trying to pass someone off with
some type of psychotic medicine

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:84%
is the most absurd
and ridiculous thing.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.880 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the very
problem that I'm speaking of.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Even what we regard as advanced
medical knowledge is not even

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:84%
beginning to come close to
understanding and assessing

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.230 align:middle line:84%
what the influence
of this condition is.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I do wish to state,
if I can, some of what

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I regard as the
significant accomplishments

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:24.760 align:middle line:90%
of this nonprofit.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And they may be the,
essentially, the resting point

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:84%
of this nonprofit, and what
it wanted to accomplish,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.250 align:middle line:90%
and what it has accomplished.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is when you have
something specific that you

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.200 align:middle line:84%
can identify, and
you have the skill--

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't raised as
a microbiologist.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I had quite a bit of
schooling in my life,

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:90%
and I adapt to the situation.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.330 align:middle line:90%
I had to school myself.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But I know a great deal about
this particular microbiology

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I know enough that
this particular organism

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.300 align:middle line:84%
can be cultured in
a very specific way.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So the first problem is that
of controlled, regulated growth

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.180 align:middle line:84%
of something that's quite real
and identifiable as a microbe.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:90%
That has been done.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.720 align:middle line:90%
That's all in place, OK?

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Thus far, it only exists
within this nonprofit.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of my goals here
will be to see whether or not

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.840 align:middle line:84%
this work can ever be
registered and distribute it

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:84%
among those that do care,
especially those that

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the origins
and cause of ill health,

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.190 align:middle line:90%
rather than trying to mask it.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The second will be that, once
the organism has been cultured

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
in a controlled environment,
the next stage of knowledge

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.025 align:middle line:84%
is to try to learn to break
this up into its parts.

00:39:39.025 --> 00:39:42.970 align:middle line:84%
All living creatures are
made of four basic types

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:46.290 align:middle line:90%
of organic compounds.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.330 align:middle line:90%
One will be proteins.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:84%
One of them will
be lipids or fats.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Another will be carbohydrates.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And another will be nucleic
acids, basically a DNA scene.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.260 align:middle line:84%
You want to come up with these
things for that way, right?

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:84%
You want to come up
with these things

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.640 align:middle line:84%
to progress that knowledge
to the next stage.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I have done that for
this microbe, OK?

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
has caused this Morgellons

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.793 align:middle line:90%
disease in people?

00:40:14.793 --> 00:40:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Well,
it is the result

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.040 align:middle line:90%
of a very specific microbe.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The answer is it's a
submicron, submicron,

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:22.840 align:middle line:90%
coccus form, and a bacteria.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:90%
It is very similar--

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.970 align:middle line:84%
it has many attributes
of the bacteria world.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.460 align:middle line:84%
However, I mentioned
earlier, that it crosses over

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:90%
into other domains.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's problems with
a straightforward bacterial

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.890 align:middle line:90%
classification, OK?

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But I will make the claim
that that specific microbe

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.380 align:middle line:90%
is responsible.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And I will make it
based upon evidence.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:47.045 align:middle line:84%
I have 400, basically, research
papers that I will present.

00:40:47.045 --> 00:40:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: If somebody wishes
to examine it, I will say,

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.060 align:middle line:84%
you will have to
look at the evidence.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.730 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed--
no one is allowed

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.800 align:middle line:84%
to adopt a position
of skepticism

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.310 align:middle line:90%
until you do the work.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.960 align:middle line:90%
You have to read the papers.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
any doubt about it,

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.350 align:middle line:90%
you have to repeat all the work.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:05.860 align:middle line:84%
All the work I've done,
one of the standards

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.210 align:middle line:90%
is that of repeatability.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:08.800 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
rules of science.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.990 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge task
for 400 papers.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Essentially, it's all there, OK?

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:16.330 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the
biomolecules of life,

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:19.600 align:middle line:84%
the next thing you need, if
you can get it, is the DNA.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I have the DNA for
this organism, OK?

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I know how to get
it, and I have it.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it done
internationally, Clifford?

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Again, we
don't know the answer.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.240 align:middle line:84%
How do we know the
answers to that which

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.486 align:middle line:90%
we're not privy to, right?

00:41:33.486 --> 00:41:35.830 align:middle line:84%
We can try to work
to the answers.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:36.820 align:middle line:90%
But we don't have them.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
What I can do is present
possibilities, right?

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.327 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And when?

00:41:45.327 --> 00:41:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Possibilities
are, first of all,

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.310 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge and be aware
that even in and are always

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.180 align:middle line:84%
these claims of how
we know everything,

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.100 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
microbiology, we're

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.100 align:middle line:84%
lucky if we know
a few percentage

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.950 align:middle line:84%
points of the number
of species that

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.270 align:middle line:90%
exist in the microbial world.

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.400 align:middle line:90%
We know nothing, OK?

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So one possibility is we don't
even know that it existed.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.780 align:middle line:90%
That's one, OK?

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But you'll have to look
at history and chronology.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, you have
a onset and an arrival

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.090 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
condition, we're

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:19.990 align:middle line:90%
talking the last 20, 30 years.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have something
that has a history prior

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:23.190 align:middle line:90%
to what we know of.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what you
can say though is

00:42:24.773 --> 00:42:27.030 align:middle line:84%
you believe Morgellons,
this disease,

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:28.980 align:middle line:90%
has come from geoengineering.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:32.040 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know if
it's intentional or not,

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.000 align:middle line:90%
could be a mistake.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.375 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: No,
it's intentional.

00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:35.470 align:middle line:90%
We know that much.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:middle line:90%
It's by design.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.010 align:middle line:84%
We know that much
because it's dispersed.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.650 align:middle line:90%
It's dispersed.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:42.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the intent then?

00:42:42.915 --> 00:42:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: The intent is
within those seven fields

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.390 align:middle line:90%
that I mentioned.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a broad
discussion, right?

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.460 align:middle line:84%
But the intent is within
those seven fields.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.990 align:middle line:84%
We could talk about biology
alone in one of those seven,

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:90%
as we're doing in part.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.920 align:middle line:90%
But if we're saying--

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.770 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the
motive of human beings,

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:08.540 align:middle line:84%
alone, to want to be able to
manipulate and control things.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And that includes life.

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
die from Morgellons?

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:15.190 align:middle line:90%
What are the--

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: Yes, sure you can.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are the outcomes?

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.267 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: There's plenty
of people that have died.

00:43:19.267 --> 00:43:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that people have
offered me their bodies, right?

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they committed
suicide because of this?

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: Sure, they have.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Sure, they have.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Sure, they have.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
if this organism

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:37.160 align:middle line:84%
was developed to destroy
populations by driving people

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.990 align:middle line:90%
insane, by driving people nuts.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:40.630 align:middle line:90%
You feel bugs under your skin.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.150 align:middle line:90%
You go crazy.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that conceivable?

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:48.126 align:middle line:90%


00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: I don't--
because everything,

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.960 align:middle line:84%
almost everything is
conceivable to me.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
that assessment

00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:01.760 align:middle line:84%
is comprehensive
enough to explain

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.240 align:middle line:84%
the depth and scope
of the existence

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.660 align:middle line:90%
of this particular microbe.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cliff, the CDC, have
they recognized Morgellons

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:11.960 align:middle line:90%
at all?

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: So the CDC
has done a purported study

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:16.650 align:middle line:90%
on this issue.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.100 align:middle line:90%
And they have issued a report.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a paper on that report
because it certainly upset

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:24.405 align:middle line:84%
and angered me enough because
it was completely and totally

00:44:24.405 --> 00:44:25.205 align:middle line:90%
irresponsible.

00:44:25.205 --> 00:44:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: I come
from a scientific side.

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking for
scientific information.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: First of all,
this was a summary report.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I saw no detail in this report.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I saw, basically,
what would appear

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.910 align:middle line:84%
to be a public press release
type thing of this study.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And I saw two major things
glaring in that report.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.480 align:middle line:84%
First would be it was
more of an implication.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like any kind of
direct scientific study to me.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:54.290 align:middle line:84%
It was an implication
that the people that

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.220 align:middle line:90%
were in this particular group--

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, I will claim
that this particular situation

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:90%
affects all of humanity.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: They have a
particular cond-- their groups,

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:04.400 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.230 align:middle line:84%
The implication is that
these people have problems.

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of
problems do they have?

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.775 align:middle line:84%
They're attend-- they're
prone to alcohol use.

00:45:12.775 --> 00:45:13.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:45:13.575 --> 00:45:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: They're
prone to drug use, OK?

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about this group

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.400 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually
misfits in society.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
have their own problem.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they've created
this thing in their heads,

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:23.430 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: And the second
issue I saw, they mentioned,

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:29.760 align:middle line:90%
they said, we do find a protein.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.990 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.720 align:middle line:84%
That's about all they said,
that we find a protein.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I hear somebody that
tells me, I have a protein,

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I have spent years
studying the protein.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.530 align:middle line:84%
When I said I had broken
those biomolecules down

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:44.020 align:middle line:84%
of this organism, one
of them is proteins.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Proteins are a huge topic,
huge topic of study,

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.230 align:middle line:90%
extremely important.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.720 align:middle line:84%
The reason you exist in your
form is because of proteins.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.340 align:middle line:84%
The reason a dog looks like
a dog is a protein, OK?

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It gives form and
structure to things.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.140 align:middle line:84%
If you start saying
you find a protein,

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:04.170 align:middle line:84%
you need to know everything
about that protein.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Proteins have
layers of structure.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Proteins are involved with--

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.550 align:middle line:84%
most disease therapies
and strategies

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:15.510 align:middle line:84%
are based upon some type of
interaction with a protein.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.960 align:middle line:84%
You can't just say, you find a
protein, and let it go at that.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I immediately expected
to find a description,

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.150 align:middle line:84%
a detailed description,
or the fact

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that they were
going to investigate

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.080 align:middle line:84%
the detailed description
of that protein.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.160 align:middle line:84%
That would take
millions of dollars.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.340 align:middle line:84%
It's equivalent
to the HIV issue.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.790 align:middle line:84%
It's equivalent to the
diabetes and insulin issue.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.260 align:middle line:84%
This is a scale of
something you're

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.760 align:middle line:84%
talking about when
you're speaking

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.400 align:middle line:84%
of a protein associated
with a disease.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.710 align:middle line:90%
They gave nothing, OK?

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.110 align:middle line:84%
They gave no
information about that.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I have spent years after
this studying this protein.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know a great deal
about the nature and--

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.710 align:middle line:84%
the chemical and organic
nature of this protein.

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:58.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a good situation.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:01.140 align:middle line:84%
That was not in
this report at all.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, you have a
certain stage you go through--

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:middle line:84%
identification, culturing,
identification, biomolecules,

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.480 align:middle line:90%
and DNA.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that DNA,
that's a lot of your story

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.790 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.950 align:middle line:84%
This is what you need
to be working with,

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.590 align:middle line:84%
not some sort of
social study that

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.080 align:middle line:84%
starts to characterize
people from a psychological

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.070 align:middle line:90%
standpoint.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And then says, oh, yeah,
there happens to be a protein,

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.270 align:middle line:90%
and let it go.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:29.730 align:middle line:84%
It is completely,
completely remiss

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:34.950 align:middle line:84%
in terms of social
responsibility.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clifford, I've
interviewed a lot of people.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're one of the best
at what you talk about.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.610 align:middle line:84%
You also seem to be the
most compassionate person

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:44.760 align:middle line:90%
and fired up I've ever seen.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.715 align:middle line:84%
This really upsets
you, doesn't it?

00:47:47.715 --> 00:47:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: What is our
place on this planet?

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's emotional
for you, isn't it?

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.477 align:middle line:90%
Are they killing us?

00:47:55.477 --> 00:47:57.066 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: Well.

00:47:57.066 --> 00:47:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can I say that?

00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Can I say that directly?

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Are they killing us?

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: I can say in
my diplomatic language,

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:06.190 align:middle line:84%
that the mortality rate
is increasing because

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:10.992 align:middle line:84%
of the impacts of the entire set
of seven arenas of application.

00:48:10.992 --> 00:48:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, all combined.

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: The mortality rate
upon the planet is increasing.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:23.650 align:middle line:84%
The disease state and the
health state is omnipresent.

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:24.610 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is affected
to some degree.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:29.740 align:middle line:90%
You cannot be not affected.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.160 align:middle line:90%
You breathe, right?

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:31.960 align:middle line:90%
You breathe.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.220 align:middle line:90%
I breathe.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.405 align:middle line:84%
If the air has been
altered, and it has,

00:48:36.405 --> 00:48:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of the alteration
can be assessed, which it has,

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.790 align:middle line:90%
it is detrimental.

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:middle line:84%
There is actually
nothing you can put in--

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:49.270 align:middle line:84%
you talked about, can you
improve upon Mother Nature?

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.220 align:middle line:84%
No, you can't
improve upon the air

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.270 align:middle line:84%
by putting something
into it, OK?

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's doing this to us?

00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Is there some sinister
group on this planet?

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Are they being done
by governments?

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Who's behind this?

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: You know, I had
to wrestle with this question

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.050 align:middle line:84%
fairly recently in a
conference I did in Santa Fe

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:12.670 align:middle line:90%
earlier this year.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And this question always
comes up as to who, right?

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who?

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Who?

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: And what I
have come to in terms of--

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I ask the problem,
what is it that you

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:28.360 align:middle line:84%
need to know in order to be able
to get a handle on a problem?

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And the classic training
was, which is true,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.175 align:middle line:84%
the classic training
is you need the W's.

00:49:34.175 --> 00:49:37.390 align:middle line:84%
You need who, what, when,
where, and why, right?

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:40.810 align:middle line:84%
You need these things
in order to understand

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:41.995 align:middle line:90%
the scope of a situation.

00:49:41.995 --> 00:49:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's basic journalism.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at this
over the years.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this question
over and over and over.

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And I started to go
through all of those W's.

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And I asked myself,
what do we know?

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Do we know anything
about those W's?

00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:59.440 align:middle line:90%
And I went through every one.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have come
to the conclusion

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:04.780 align:middle line:84%
that we know a fair
amount, a fair amount,

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.990 align:middle line:84%
enough for me to be able to
make certain claims to you

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:09.820 align:middle line:90%
that I would not make lightly.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that all of
those W's, to some degree--

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
completely at all.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But they've been-- they
actually have been addressed

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.010 align:middle line:90%
to some degree except for one.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who?

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.725 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: And guess
what the one is, OK?

00:50:23.725 --> 00:50:24.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who?

00:50:24.525 --> 00:50:25.325 align:middle line:90%
Who?

00:50:25.325 --> 00:50:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: And for
those that say, well,

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.820 align:middle line:90%
why would anybody do this?

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I will make the claim
to you that we all

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:37.080 align:middle line:84%
have the responsibility
to answer that final W,

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and that we, when we
know the who, we will now

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.770 align:middle line:84%
be able to answer certain
questions that have always

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:48.630 align:middle line:84%
remained inescapable because
it is one of the essentials.

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:53.220 align:middle line:84%
It is true, what we can say,
is that the who have not

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.680 align:middle line:90%
chosen to reveal themselves.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.910 align:middle line:90%
This is what we can say.

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't want to.

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: The who
has not come forth.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.310 align:middle line:90%
There is no consent.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:06.810 align:middle line:84%
There is no consent to the
changes and alterations that

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:84%
are taking place upon the
planet, that involve all seven

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:11.940 align:middle line:90%
of those arenas.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:15.870 align:middle line:90%
They violate basic human rights.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.946 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could this be
a rogue organization?

00:51:17.946 --> 00:51:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: It could
be anything, OK?

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, I try very hard to
not eliminate any possibility

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.070 align:middle line:84%
until you have grounds
to eliminate it.

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, nothing can
be eliminated in terms of what

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:41.290 align:middle line:84%
who really means and what the
scale of that who really means.

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:45.370 align:middle line:84%
You can come up with some
strategic answers that

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:48.040 align:middle line:84%
address a portion of
how things can work

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:90%
in terms of power structures.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:54.250 align:middle line:84%
But you can not truly address it
when someone operates-- or call

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:56.740 align:middle line:84%
it even a someone--
again, you, one,

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.790 align:middle line:84%
must be careful to
make assumptions.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But whatever the who is, until
you know that, you are not

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:07.720 align:middle line:84%
in a position to be answering
the very questions that you're

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.360 align:middle line:84%
asking about the
unknowns, right?

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Based on your
research, would you

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:14.680 align:middle line:84%
say that the Morgellons
aspect of all

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.120 align:middle line:84%
of this that we've
talked about today

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.990 align:middle line:90%
may be the worst of everything?

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:22.568 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
else out there?

00:52:22.568 --> 00:52:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: I had
to make a decision.

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:25.490 align:middle line:90%
My work has its origins--

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:27.440 align:middle line:90%
roughly 20 years of work now.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:32.240 align:middle line:84%
My work has its origins in
the geoengineering aspects,

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.120 align:middle line:84%
primarily, primarily,
but not exclusively,

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.510 align:middle line:84%
but what was being done
physically to alter our planet.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Out of that work
evolved this work

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:46.600 align:middle line:84%
into the biological
aspect more strongly, OK?

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I actually reached a junction
point in my research,

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.930 align:middle line:90%
where I only have so much time.

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I have to make choices
about priorities.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's true that I
shifted the focus of my work

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:02.870 align:middle line:90%
into the biological aspects, OK?

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And I did that because of,
really, a couple reasons.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:12.190 align:middle line:84%
You could say in a sense an
act of desperation because we

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:13.270 align:middle line:90%
don't have infinite time.

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I certainly don't
have infinite time.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:19.150 align:middle line:84%
But I realize, in terms of
how the human mind works,

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:21.502 align:middle line:84%
and they're actually
very egocentric.

00:53:21.502 --> 00:53:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Most people think
about themselves.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.870 align:middle line:84%
They do not think about
all life on this planet

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.767 align:middle line:84%
as a regular part
of their life, OK?

00:53:27.767 --> 00:53:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
into their own thing.

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: In general,
humans are very self-centered.

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to ask myself,
in the time that I have,

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.830 align:middle line:84%
what is the greatest
good, what is

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:43.000 align:middle line:84%
the greatest benefit that I can
bring to light at this point?

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I know, from my own
experience, that when I'm sick,

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I can't fight.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:53.940 align:middle line:84%
When I'm sick, I can
not be the human being

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.580 align:middle line:90%
that I know is my life.

00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And I see that as a decision
for all of humanity,

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that we cannot fight
if we are not healthy,

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.170 align:middle line:90%
if we are not of sound mind.

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:10.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have the
ability to even, necessarily,

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:15.000 align:middle line:84%
know what to do if we're
debilitized in some way,

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and hurt in some kind
of way, debilitated.

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:19.530 align:middle line:90%
We can't.

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:20.520 align:middle line:90%
We can't.

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it
was necessary to shift

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:28.890 align:middle line:84%
my focus so that we could fight
because we do need to fight.

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.930 align:middle line:84%
We need to fight
for what is right.

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you join the
great hereafter, who picks up

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.260 align:middle line:90%
this torch and runs with it?

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: It's one
of the greatest issues

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:44.060 align:middle line:90%
that I'm wrestling with.

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not 26 anymore.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:46.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm not 46.

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm 66, soon to be 67.

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So I, through my whole
life, when I was 25,

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking of what it
would be like to be 67.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So I am quite aware of this
problem and this issue.

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to work on it
quite diligently, actually.

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that
the work I've done

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:84%
as an individual in
a small nonprofit,

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.450 align:middle line:84%
it's actually
mature, as far as I

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:16.490 align:middle line:84%
am able to-- those are some very
significant accomplishments,

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I feel and think,
in terms of what's

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:24.230 align:middle line:84%
available to the scientific
community and health

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:25.670 align:middle line:90%
communities to progress with.

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think I have a good
sense of what needs to be done.

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.440 align:middle line:84%
It's very logical to me what you
do next with the information.

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I will never have the
resources to do that.

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's fair to say that it's
time for me to consolidate

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.640 align:middle line:90%
the work that I've done.

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is a phase that I'm
entering in, this attempt

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.460 align:middle line:90%
to consolidate the work.

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually already
seen the transition

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.060 align:middle line:90%
of generations and the issue.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a good thing?

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: You
have a 20-year-old--

00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:58.018 align:middle line:84%
you have a 20-year-old
kid right now?

00:55:58.018 --> 00:56:00.560 align:middle line:84%
When you ask them what's normal,
it's a fascinating question.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.520 align:middle line:90%
What's normal?

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.103 align:middle line:84%
What's normal is
what they've grown up

00:56:03.103 --> 00:56:04.430 align:middle line:90%
with for 20 years, right?

00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:06.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's
normal to them.

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's
not my norm when

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I grew up, the
alterations in our world.

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
hopeful for the future?

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Oh,
I'm always hopeful.

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm always hopeful.

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:84%
As long as we know
the difference

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:24.303 align:middle line:84%
between right and wrong, I
can be hopeful eternally.

00:56:24.303 --> 00:56:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clifford, if people
want more information on what

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.390 align:middle line:90%
you do, how can they find you?

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.003 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: The Institute
does exist on the web.

00:56:32.003 --> 00:56:33.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm here in person with you.

00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:35.000 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you for that.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's a library
of research on the web.

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spell out
your Institute for us.

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.920 align:middle line:10%
>>CARNICOM:
carnicominstitute.org

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:43.910 align:middle line:10%
is the name of it.

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:48.140 align:middle line:10%
My last name is Carnicom,
C-A-R-N-I-C-O-M,

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.450 align:middle line:10%
and then the word Institute.org.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:51.920 align:middle line:10%
I will emphasize .org.

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:55.940 align:middle line:10%
The .com is a troll site,
carnicominstitute.org.

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And there's an email there.

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.990 align:middle line:84%
You could send it to anything,
but info@carnicominstitute.org

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.790 align:middle line:90%
will work.

00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:02.480 align:middle line:90%
We're a small organization.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, I'm planning
our period of consolidation

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:06.785 align:middle line:90%
and protection of the work.

00:57:06.785 --> 00:57:07.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking ahead.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I also have a major
proposal in place,

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.260 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it will
ever be acted upon.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But I am essentially
appealing to the world.

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.450 align:middle line:84%
I am appealing to
philanthropy at this stage.

00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I have certain ethical
boundaries and guidelines

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:21.950 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what I
think needs to happen.

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:24.290 align:middle line:84%
The public interest
does need to be served.

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So I am working on protecting
the work when I'm not here.

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And my job is to
make it available

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.060 align:middle line:84%
for future generations
at this stage.

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone does wish to act
on the proposals I've made,

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.710 align:middle line:84%
which are listed on the site,
I will become very engaged

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:39.510 align:middle line:90%
in that process.

>>NOORY: Super, Clifford,
thanks for having

00:57:41.302 --> 00:57:42.470 align:middle line:90%
the guts to come forward.

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Thank you
very much, George.

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.730 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it as always.

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Geoengineering,
bioengineering, it's happening.

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.630 align:middle line:90%
The big question is why?

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:52.490 align:middle line:84%
We'll keep looking
for that answer.

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
