00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:84%
We've got an amazing
program for you today.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:10%
Sarah Breskman Cosme with
us, a bestselling author

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.178 align:middle line:10%
of a great book about Atlantis
and a master hypnotist.

00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:30.595 align:middle line:84%
Sarah, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
>>SARAH BRESKMAN COSME:
Thanks so much for having me.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.424 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, great, George.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:90%
I love being on your show.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You followed
through with the work

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
of the great late
Dolores Cannon.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.555 align:middle line:90%
How did you come upon her?

00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Just by accident.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.620 align:middle line:10%
I never thought I'd ever
get into this work, ever.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to be a
psychologist, actually.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:10%
And then life just
took me down the path

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:10%
of wanting to get to the very
root cause of a person's issues.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.355 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I eventually
got into hypnosis.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:04.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And past
life regression?

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I actually was doing
Doctor Brian Weiss's method,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:90%
who's so amazing.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:90%
I love him.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a great guy.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: For many
years, but I just felt

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
like something was
missing in my life.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So I contacted a psychic and
she said, oh, my gosh, this

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
is the easiest reading
I've ever done.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to do
Dolores Cannon's method,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be teaching it.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be talking about her
work and helping her daughter.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:90%
She said, her daughter.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be writing books and
speaking about the information

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:90%
you find all over the world.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, my gosh,
this is a terrible reading,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't even
know who this psychic--

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know who this
Delores Cannon person was.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At that time,
you didn't know at all.

00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Didn't know.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard of her.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I eventually found
her on my internet one day

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and then just listened
to what she had to say.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And I knew right away
that that was the method

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:90%
that I needed to pursue.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Her daughter
is carrying on the torch

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:90%
of Dolores's work right now.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah, she is.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And I assisted her
and taught with her

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:84%
the method all over the
world before the quarantine.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Dolores method
is called the QHHT regression.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.885 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: What she developed
after 45 years of research

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:84%
was a way to actually
regress a person to the very

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:84%
deepest level of trance,
then access their higher

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, you can find
out anything about a person.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:84%
You can find out things like
who they really, really are,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:90%
their true purpose.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can even heal yourself.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this
method is so popular,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
because you can really get to
the very root cause of an issue.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:90%
And the body is a messenger.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:90%
So the body sends us messages.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you've quieted your
conscious mind a little bit,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
you can access this
information, like,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
what is the cause
of your problems

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
just by tuning in
deeply to yourself.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
get the message,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
you can instantly be
released and healed.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take us kind of
through the steps of this kind

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:90%
of past life regression.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.305 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:03:23.305 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: So it's so cool.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So first, it starts with
a past life regression.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you can find out
really interesting details

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that the person has hidden
in their subconscious memory

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:90%
just by quieting their mind.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:90%
So they go through a regression.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a past
life, sometimes they

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
remember a different
planet, and sometimes they

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
remember in between
lives and that's

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of everything.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Then after we go
through the lifetime,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.183 align:middle line:84%
then I access their
higher consciousness.

00:03:57.183 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fast-forward.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And then I can ask
anything and find out anything.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm so lucky to do this
work because I have changed

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:84%
so much just by understanding
different things about the way

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:90%
the universe works.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, before I got
into any of this stuff,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I used to be so afraid of
all these different things,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.212 align:middle line:84%
and I used to be
so stressed out.

00:04:19.212 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why were
you afraid of it?

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, I didn't
really understand

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:90%
the nature of our reality.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really understand that
there really isn't anything

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:90%
to worry about because--

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is the reason I'm
so passionate about sharing

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:90%
this information--

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:90%
I do this work almost every day.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I get the
opportunity to speak

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:84%
to this higher consciousness
that comes through my clients

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
when they're deep
under hypnosis.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And they say things
that are so profound,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
like, we are on the
right trajectory,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:90%
everything is working out.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
They give me this
information that's

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:90%
just really life-changing.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they know what
they're saying under hypnosis?

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.875 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So this
is how it feels.

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:84%
You know that state when
you wake up in the morning

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and you still have
access to your dream--

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The hypnagogic state.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yeah, you can find out
anything in that state, the very

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:90%
deep theta state.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:90%
So it feels like that state.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And then in this state, with a
guide, with someone helping you,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
you can access anything
and find out anything.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it definitely feels
as if you are at the moment

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
while the information
is coming through,

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:84%
that you're able to hear it
and understand it basically.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:84%
But often times,
what happens is when

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.795 align:middle line:84%
you wake up out of that state,
it instantly starts to fade.

00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
meet anybody, Sarah,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:90%
who did not have a past life?

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.145 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah, actually.

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:48.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Some people haven't
had a past life here on Earth.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
had multiple lives--

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or do they just not
remember it in a regression?

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: That's
very interesting.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:84%
What I found is that some people
are here on this Earth planet

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
because they're volunteering
from other star systems.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So they come here
as a volunteer.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Just like what
Dolores uncovered,

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
they come here as
a volunteer to take

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness and the
personality of their realm

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:84%
or planet and integrate
it onto this Earth plane.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And all they have to
do is just be here.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And once they've
become aware of this,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
it actually helps
them to start really

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
spreading this vibration because
they're more aware of who they

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:90%
really are.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why they say the
awakened starseed is

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
like a very powerful receptor
because all they have to do

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
is really be on this Earth plane
to spread this high frequency.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a friend of
mine, Dr. Bruce Goldberg, who

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is a past life
regressionist as well,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and he takes people
into the future.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, that's so fun.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people always
ask me about the future.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is
about the future

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that it really depends on each
person's, each individual belief

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
system, because we actually
create our own reality

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
through our eyes,
through our pineal gland,

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and we render the
external reality

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
based on our own
internal belief system.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask somebody
like me or anybody

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that does this work, what
the future looks like,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
it looks different according
to each person's belief system.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you what
the majority of people

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.587 align:middle line:84%
have said under hypnosis
about the future.

00:07:38.587 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that is what?

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So right now there
are many different timelines

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
according to your
belief system, but most

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:84%
of the higher
consciousness has said

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:90%
that we will hit a nexus point.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, this isn't a scary
thing or a bad thing.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
This is just a
nexus point, which

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a big event
where everyone will be affected

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
to the point where the timelines
will then start to merge.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So then after this nexus
point, what I have been told

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:84%
is that there will be three
timelines, the top timeline,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:84%
the one that is the
highest timeline.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, is according
to your belief systems.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do
this life wrong,

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:84%
but the highest
timeline is what people

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
have seen extraterrestrials
come and help us, clean up

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:90%
our oceans.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
We start to speak
telepathically with one another.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.020 align:middle line:84%
We create these beautiful
school systems for our children.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The highest timeline
looks amazing.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
The middle timeline
in the future

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.520 align:middle line:84%
looks like most humans go
down the path of the Grey

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Will they go too far with their
technology and they end up

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:90%
losing their planet.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Have to jump universes just like
the gray extraterrestrials did,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:90%
come back out in.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand that
when you end your life, when

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
your life is over and
you go to the in-between,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:90%
you know yourself again as god.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.715 align:middle line:90%
You are source, in a sense.

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would think so?

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: You want the feeling
of not knowing that when you

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.820 align:middle line:90%
come into a physical reality.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So you pretend to be
different than everybody else.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:90%
You pretend to be an individual.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And you pretend to be physical.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.960 align:middle line:90%
All of this is an illusion.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And so some people come
into this Earth plane

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
to experience what it's like to
be an individual, to experience

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
what it's like to
forget, and they

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
have no intention of
working on themselves,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
of awakening their
consciousness.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:84%
They want to feel what it's
really like to be a human

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
because they know deep
down that they are source.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Everyone deep down, when
you hypnotize anyone,

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
bring them to the deepest level
of trance, they remember again.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.403 align:middle line:84%
They're, like, oh, I
am everyone, I see.

00:10:00.403 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it works.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So what is
happening right now

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
is we are on this trajectory
of this mass awakening.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So the timeline that is
the highest timeline, that

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
is the most probable, it
is in alignment for us

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:90%
to reach this highest timeline.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So what is happening right now
is that stars are not really

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:90%
stars.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:90%
They're actually portals.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And each human is tethered
to one of these portals.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.475 align:middle line:84%
And there are 13 of
these star portals.

00:10:31.475 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And all of us
are tethered to them.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So these star portals go
in a wave-like pattern.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:90%
So they go up.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
When they go up, you're
having a golden age.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
When they go down, it's
more of a negative age.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Our stars, our
originating stars are

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:90%
headed in an upwards direction.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:90%
So we are all in alignment.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing that
anybody can do to alter this.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.132 align:middle line:84%
We are in alignment
on this Earth.

00:11:00.132 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good thing.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: That's
reality right now.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did a
past life regression

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
with a client who claims to have
been from the Pleiadian's star

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:90%

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:90%
- It is pants.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:90%
They are tight pants.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I have a belt. And
I have a jacket

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:29.982 align:middle line:84%
that is tight with a star
on the left chest pocket.

00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:84%
- You get a sense as
to what the star means?

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.326 align:middle line:84%
- It is a symbol for our
Intergalactic Alliance.

00:11:37.326 --> 00:11:39.445 align:middle line:84%
- Oh, could you
tell me about that?

00:11:39.445 --> 00:11:43.630 align:middle line:84%
- There are many star systems
involved in the Intergalactic

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Alliance and I cannot
speak to any of them.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Our piece of the alliance,
the Pleiadean's star system

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.065 align:middle line:84%
represents one of the
points of the star.

00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I have a face and a body
and hair and everything

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:84%
that appears to be very humanoid
while I'm here on Earth.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I do not have that I'm a light
being when I am not on Earth.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.630 align:middle line:90%
- I see.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.745 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have that body
when you're not on Earth?

00:12:18.745 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:84%
- I only have this
body when I need

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:84%
to come somewhere where the
third density that requires

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:90%
a body.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.875 align:middle line:84%
- And how do you
talk through Jasmine?

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:90%
- Jasmine is a channel.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:90%
She's a vessel.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.228 align:middle line:84%
She has allowed me to
come and speak to you

00:12:36.228 --> 00:12:37.603 align:middle line:84%
and answer all of
your questions.

most shocking things you've

00:12:40.351 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:84%
heard in the past
life regression?

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Gosh, I don't know.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I haven't really been
shocked in a long time,

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.830 align:middle line:84%
but that was shocking to me
because that's one of my friends

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:84%
who has three kids who
didn't really know anything

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:90%
about extraterrestrials.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.580 align:middle line:90%
I find--

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.747 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She sure seemed to.

00:12:55.747 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I know.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the thing.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, when
they're under hypnosis,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:84%
actually can remember
being an extraterrestrial.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So what does that say
about extraterrestrials?

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
If not only can
extraterrestrials

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.190 align:middle line:84%
come through and speak
through my clients like that,

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
almost like using
them as a radio,

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
but so many people have memories
of being an extraterrestrial,

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.460 align:middle line:84%
then what does that say
about extraterrestrials?

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we are the
extraterrestrials.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And OK, one thing I found really
interesting was so many people

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:84%
come in for sessions and
they're so afraid of being

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:90%
contacted by extraterrestrials.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have to say--

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they afraid of?

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.888 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, they're
afraid because sometimes

00:13:43.888 --> 00:13:45.280 align:middle line:90%
their experience wasn't--

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.487 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pleasant.

00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: --pleasant.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, it depends on
the different type

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial, because
a lot of times, when you're

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
being contacted by an
extraterrestrial that's

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
in a different
frequency, what happens

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:84%
is the body feels like
it was put in an ice bath

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:84%
because all the hormones are
pumping out of the person

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:90%
and they just feel so shocked.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult
for a lot of my clients.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
But what I found so fascinating
is that most of the people,

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
when they're under
hypnosis, are really

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
tuning in to this
experience, find out

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually
them taking them,

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:90%
not something other than them.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a caller that
calls our radio show "Coast

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to Coast" often, and she
claims to be the reincarnated

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Cleopatra.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Why does it seem
that people, when

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
they talk about
their past lives,

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:84%
always try to be an important
figure in human existence?

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they just be
some average person?

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, so
many people can

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
have memories of one
particular past life event.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times,
what happens is

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
if a person is incarnating for,
say, the first time on the Earth

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
plane, then they will
choose to imprint themselves

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:90%
with a lifetime memory.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So they might choose to
imprint this memory of, say,

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Cleopatra so there can be
multiple people walking

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:84%
the planet that actually
could remember her lifetime.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's not my
experience that people

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:90%
remember famous lifetimes.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Most of my clients
under hypnosis

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.955 align:middle line:90%
remember just regular people.

00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get a lot
of past life discussions

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.736 align:middle line:90%
about Atlantis and Lemuria?

00:15:33.736 --> 00:15:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: When I was
writing my book,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
"A Hypnotist's
Journey to Atlantis,"

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a really weird
coincidence that so many--

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are no
coincidence, you know that.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So many people were
remembering the same time

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:52.010 align:middle line:84%
period of Atlantis or Lemuria,
and the higher consciousness

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:90%
told me.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
They said that I had decided
before I came into this lifetime

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
to uncover and share this
information with the world

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
that the world had been waiting
for thousands and thousands

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:90%
of years for this information.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But the time hadn't been
right for this information

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:90%
to be shared.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I needed to share this
because people had been waiting

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:84%
for it and it was so important
and it would change their life.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
is so important that I

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:90%
needed to share with the world?

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So I took one of my
clients deep under hypnosis

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and asked, what is the
story that you want

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:90%
me to share with the world?

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And they took me
to the beginning

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial memory
where beings crash-landed

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:90%
and started to see the planet.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I understood
was that we really

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:90%
are, really all from the stars.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
We're just all here
for this experience.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
But really, every single person
that's walking the planet today

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:84%
is part of this ancient
group of beings.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And we've all traveled
from planet to planet

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:90%
to evolve our consciousness.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.599 align:middle line:84%
And this is like a
never ending experience.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:20.975 align:middle line:90%
It folds up on itself.

00:17:20.975 --> 00:17:22.089 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
You now did some
work on the Sphinx.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.909 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: The Sphinx
is really fascinating

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:84%
because what I found from my
clients deep under hypnosis

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:84%
is that within the
Sphinx, there are scrolls.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:10%
And if you go to
these sacred sites,

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:10%
you can actually
activate your DNA.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:10%
So if you go to the
Sphinx, say, for instance,

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:10%
about a foot and a half off the
ground are these light codes.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is they work
with your own crown chakra.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go to
any place in Egypt,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
you'll see all these
hieroglyphs and these signs

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.055 align:middle line:84%
that look like they're
leading to some clue or a key.

00:17:59.055 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then they stop.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: No, the key is you.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.880 align:middle line:84%
You are the key that
unlocks these sacred places.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go to
these places, what happens

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is these places are
built on specific energy

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:90%
lines for a reason.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.450 align:middle line:84%
You go there, these light codes
work with your own crown chakra

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's you that's the
key that unlocks the code.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at some of the
hieroglyphs in these places,

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
sacred symbols that

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:84%
work like a key that unlocks
transmission in your mind.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.765 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, all you have
to do is go to these places.

00:18:35.765 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating
work that you do.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about Aniwaya.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Who is that?

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Aniwaya was actually
a personality, a past life

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.870 align:middle line:84%
regression that happened through
one of my clients named Les.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I brought
Les under hypnosis,

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.900 align:middle line:84%
almost it sounded a
little more masculine.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, he
even had an accent.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But as we worked
together a little bit,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:90%
it starting to even out.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But Aniwaya was Les's past
life as a Native American who

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
told me his first-hand
perspective of walking

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:90%
the Trail of Tears.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.305 align:middle line:84%
We've got some video of him
recounting that situation.

00:19:16.305 --> 00:19:17.105 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
- I see white people
with white hair,

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.530 align:middle line:84%
something I've
never seen before.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:34.790 align:middle line:84%
My skin is like
caramel, deep caramel,

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:90%
and these people are so pale.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:90%
At first.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if they're OK, because
I see some of their veins.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:90%
And they say, resigning--

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm with Blackfox.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:90%
We're here together.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I would say that I have a love
for him but not a romantic love,

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
but a deep soul brother
connection, though we

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.442 align:middle line:90%
are not brothers.

00:20:07.442 --> 00:20:09.385 align:middle line:90%
- Wonderful.

00:20:09.385 --> 00:20:10.863 align:middle line:90%
- We are here.

00:20:10.863 --> 00:20:13.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
for signing a treaty
or at least trying

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:90%
to get some kind of peace.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
take our lands.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.613 align:middle line:90%
It's been an issue.

00:20:27.613 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, I can
see myself about 12 or 13

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:90%
when they came into my village.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.286 align:middle line:90%
- What was that like?

00:20:47.286 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:90%
- They burned everything.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:90%
- Tell me about that.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:57.130 align:middle line:84%
- I ran into the forest
with my dog and my horse,

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and my bow on my back
trying to get away.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:84%
My mom told me to run,
but I didn't want to.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be strong.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to fight, but she said
that somebody had to make it.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an incredible
episode that she went through.

00:21:15.215 --> 00:21:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yeah, I mean, I
really got to know Aniwaya,

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and his story was just so
heartbreaking yet profound.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that was Aniwaya
speaking through my client Les.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But what Aniwaya said was
that he had been watching me

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:84%
before coming through my client
because he felt it was really

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:90%
important to share his story.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
share his story about

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
his own first-hand perspective
of walking this Trail of Tears.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
But what I feel like
Aniwaya shared with me

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:84%
that really changed
my life was as--

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could see
it's just heartbreaking--

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say, you
seem sad when you talk about it.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yeah, because I really
felt like I got to know him.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:90%
And there were times when--

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to hear these stories.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to cry.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But what changed my life was
that I felt upset at one point.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Aniwaya, what
happened to the white man?

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Why did they do this to
the native Americans?

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Because his recounts of walking
the trail was so horrific.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And Aniwaya said something
that changed my life.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:84%
He said that most of
them, not all of them,

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:84%
understood that it wasn't the
white man they were fighting.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Aniwaya told me that they knew
that the White man were some

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
of the earliest victims of
this negative energy that

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
had asserted itself
to the planet,

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and that the white man's culture
was stolen from them so long

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
ago that they even forgot
they even had a culture,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and they were just
walking around forgetting

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:90%
who they really were.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And Aniwaya told me that
the White man's culture used

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:84%
to live among nature, have
all these magical beliefs,

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:84%
but it was taken from
them so long ago that they

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:90%
forgotten all of this.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And so Aniwaya said he
knew it wasn't really them

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.320 align:middle line:90%
that they were fighting.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And it helped me really put into
perspective that we are really

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.470 align:middle line:90%
all this one consciousness.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Because as you can see, my
client is a Caucasian woman.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:90%
She's about 30 years old.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
You know that she is
not a Native American.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.240 align:middle line:84%
We're all reincarnations
over and over again.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We come to learn lessons
and we reincarnate

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.300 align:middle line:84%
in these different
families and groups.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's just really interesting
how we just come together

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:55.942 align:middle line:90%
to try to learn these lessons.

00:23:55.942 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they remember any
of this when you wake them up?

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: When my client,
Les, first woke up,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:84%
she looked a little
bit shocked because she

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.097 align:middle line:84%
had had an imaginary
friend named

00:24:11.097 --> 00:24:12.305 align:middle line:90%
Aniwaya when she was younger.

00:24:12.305 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you let them
listen to what they said?

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, I always
send them with a recording,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:84%
but my client, Les and I,
decided to work together

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:90%
to really uncover this story.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.155 align:middle line:84%
So we worked together
maybe 20 times.

00:24:27.155 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did she have any
extraterrestrial memories?

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.483 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: No, she didn't
really go deep into that.

00:24:32.483 --> 00:24:33.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just earthbound.

00:24:33.525 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: But Aniwaya had a lot
of extraterrestrial memories

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
because the tribes
during that time

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.580 align:middle line:84%
or even before were very
connected to the star people.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And Aniwaya called
them the Seven Sisters.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:84%
He never used the same type
of terminology that I did,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:84%
but they claimed that they came
pretty much from the Pleiadian

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:90%
star system.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that these were
their brothers and sisters,

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.480 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And they would perform
these ceremonies.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was really interesting
because they used their drums

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and they used their
mind to tune in

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and they would be able to
telepathically communicate

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.450 align:middle line:90%
with these star people.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think most humans

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.600 align:middle line:84%
have extraterrestrial
regressed abilities?

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: No, I
think all humans do.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of us?

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.535 align:middle line:84%
We've all been
ETs, at some point?

00:25:30.535 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I do think
so, yes, because we all

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:84%
have an extraterrestrial
counterpart to ourselves.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Our soul splits itself off
in many different fractals

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.320 align:middle line:84%
in order to experience
multiple experiences

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and every human has an
extraterrestrial counterpart.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
time, it doesn't exist

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of the universe.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
is happening--

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:84%
everything is happening
in this now moment.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.985 align:middle line:84%
So everything in the past is
actually happening right now.

00:26:00.985 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you think
about that, there

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.985 align:middle line:84%
are future versions
of yourselves.

00:26:03.985 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we have a
clip of one of your clients

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:84%
that you regressed who talks
about a memory of being

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:90%
on an extraterrestrial craft.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.153 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

00:26:12.153 --> 00:26:12.953 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:12.953 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:84%
- Would it be possible to
look around on the ship

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:90%
and describe it to me?

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:84%
- The smaller vessels
are all curved.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.902 align:middle line:84%
They have a fine dust
powder of crystals,

00:26:21.902 --> 00:26:23.360 align:middle line:84%
all spray-- it
seems to be sprayed,

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I would describe as sprayed
around the entire inside

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:90%
of the vessel.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So everything sparkles
just slightly.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And everything is curved, so
the little stool type seats

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:90%
are curved.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
There are indented,
curved things

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:41.980 align:middle line:84%
for the hands, three fingers
and thumb-type thing.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a screen, but it's
not a screen like we have.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:84%
It just is the wall and
it is on when it's on,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's not really
there when it's off.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.487 align:middle line:84%
Everything's lit
up without lights.

00:26:51.487 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of just glowing.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Everything's kind of ambient.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
There's sort of a
resting quarters,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.235 align:middle line:84%
but there's no real
need to sleep per se.

00:26:58.235 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:84%
- What's done in the
resting quarters?

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.663 align:middle line:84%
- Reflection, maintenance to the
non-physical, non-organic body,

00:27:05.663 --> 00:27:06.580 align:middle line:90%
that's pretty much it.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Going through records,
self-reflection.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
There's not a whole lot of time
where there isn't work to do.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
- Can you go to the
technology and put your hands

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.135 align:middle line:84%
in the handprint and tell me
what happens when you do that?

00:27:18.135 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:84%
- I'm not allowed to just go
do that, but I know it happens.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:90%
- Why not?

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:84%
- I'm not the one
who is supposed

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to be flying this vessel.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.375 align:middle line:90%
- Who flies the vessel?

00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:31.715 align:middle line:90%
- The taller Greys.

00:27:31.715 --> 00:27:32.515 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:32.515 --> 00:27:34.228 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was he
describing, Sarah?

00:27:34.228 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: So it was interesting.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.050 align:middle line:84%
He was describing being inside
a Grey extraterrestrial ship.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:41.675 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
interesting because--

00:27:41.675 --> 00:27:42.925 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did he get there?

00:27:42.925 --> 00:27:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, so
that's the thing.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:84%
When he was under
hypnosis, he realized

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:84%
there's a parallel
version of himself there.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, it was
actually able to speak

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
with what I believe were the
Grey extraterrestrials, so they

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.035 align:middle line:90%
could use him as well as other--

00:27:59.035 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he
wasn't an abductee.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:90%
He was an ET?

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he could
communicate directly

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:84%
with this parallel
version of himself.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But it was interesting
because their technology

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.600 align:middle line:90%
is really fascinating.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:84%
They claim that the Greys that
came through multiple clients

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:84%
claimed that they're actually
responsible for giving us 3D

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.010 align:middle line:90%
printing, facial recognition--

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.944 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They may be.

00:28:28.944 --> 00:28:31.027 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: --and fiber optics,
and things like that.

00:28:31.027 --> 00:28:32.235 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Advanced technology.

00:28:32.235 --> 00:28:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And so
they claim that they

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:84%
have, in a sense, a beneficial
relationship with us.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But he was describing
being on the ship

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and how the taller
Greys are the ones that

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.720 align:middle line:90%
are in charge of the mission.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.796 align:middle line:84%
And he was in a--
he's an apprentice.

00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A hybrid is a cross
between an ET and a human.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
He seems like he was more ET in
another life, is that the case?

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So he's actually tuning in to
an extraterrestrial version

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:04.800 align:middle line:90%
of himself.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does he do that?

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, it's easy.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:90%
He's just doing it--

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's easy?

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: --under hypnosis,
because most of us

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.960 align:middle line:90%
also have this.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Most of us can actually
do that under hypnosis.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't hypnotize me,
but go through a technique

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:90%
of hypnotizing me.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I want to see what you do.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Really?

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Can I hypnotize you?

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, basically--

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go for it.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Really?

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:30.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.775 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can do hypnosis
right now, if you want.

00:29:33.775 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're not going
to put me under, but pretend

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.620 align:middle line:90%
that you were.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: OK.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I want to see--

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.843 align:middle line:90%
I want to see what you do.

00:29:39.843 --> 00:29:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, first, I would
just have you relax your body,

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.317 align:middle line:90%
because what it feels like--

00:29:45.317 --> 00:29:46.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm closing my eyes.

00:29:46.525 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: OK.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, just imagine a
wave of deep relaxation

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.980 align:middle line:84%
just flow from the
top of your head

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:02.040 align:middle line:84%
all the way down through your
body like a beautiful wave

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.110 align:middle line:90%
of deep relaxation.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine or visualize
a stairway in front of you.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.756 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is relaxing.

00:30:12.756 --> 00:30:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It is.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Can I keep going?

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.822 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, please.

00:30:17.822 --> 00:30:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And then so
basically, I would just

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:24.440 align:middle line:84%
take you down a set of stairs
or different method just

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to help your body relax and then
your mind would start to relax.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a great sense
of feeling like a huge relief

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.626 align:middle line:84%
and feeling so good within
your mind and your body.

00:30:38.626 --> 00:30:41.822 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do I feel like
I'm losing control of myself?

00:30:41.822 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, it's OK if
you lose control of yourself.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:84%
You always have
control of yourself

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
because your higher-self always
has control over your body,

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.240 align:middle line:90%
over your mind.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's very healthy to go
into that deep, relaxed state.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It's very healthy for
your mind and your body.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And you can find out anything.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
If you want to, you can just
sink even deeper, relax.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Just perfectly see.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine the
stairway in front of you

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:21.320 align:middle line:90%
with each and every step down.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.972 align:middle line:84%
You can just double
this deep relaxation.

00:31:24.972 --> 00:31:30.246 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.246 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We better
pull out of this

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.562 align:middle line:90%
before I go under, for sure.

00:31:34.562 --> 00:31:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: But that's essentially
what it would feel like.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It just feels like
you can really

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:84%
just tune into yourself because
there's a whole world out there.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And when the extraterrestrials
speak through my clients,

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:51.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times they say that
as our consciousness starts

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to raise and we want
to experience more

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.220 align:middle line:84%
of this contact, the best
way to prepare for type

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
contact is actually

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:84%
by going inwards and
starting to clear

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:84%
our minds, because this
communication is telepathic.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's one way to
really prepare yourself

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:15.230 align:middle line:84%
for being contacted,
because what

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:84%
happens is a lot of these
beings, when they look at you,

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.640 align:middle line:90%
they can see straight into you.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:90%
They know everything about you.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And the human being
doesn't really

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.545 align:middle line:84%
know how to control
their thoughts.

00:32:26.545 --> 00:32:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just go
out at random, right?

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you start to learn how
to control your thoughts,

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.260 align:middle line:84%
it will help with this
type of experience.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:40.200 align:middle line:84%
But the way that our
trajectory is set up

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.350 align:middle line:84%
is the more you take a
deep dive within yourself

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and you start looking
into who you really are,

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:84%
then the universe responds by
becoming interested in you.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually
an initiation process.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is a reflection
of our internal world.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the more you
become curious of who you really

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.030 align:middle line:84%
are, what will happen is this
the initiation process starts

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.000 align:middle line:90%
like this--

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.750 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden you'll
think it's really random,

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.280 align:middle line:84%
but you'll start to
see repeating numbers.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'll start to have
these hits where you can predict

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.920 align:middle line:90%
the future a little bit.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.300 align:middle line:84%
You'll just start to see things
that you never really started

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.480 align:middle line:90%
to see before.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's because you're
beginning this initiation

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.670 align:middle line:84%
process of actually really
tuning into this higher

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:30.560 align:middle line:90%
level of frequency.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do your
clients say about the future?

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.830 align:middle line:90%
They say the same thing?

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yes, they all
say the same thing.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've regressed so
many different people

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and I've asked so many
different higher selves.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And if I had even
just one tell me

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:84%
that the future
looked really bleak,

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.350 align:middle line:84%
then I would be the
first to report it.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.560 align:middle line:84%
But these are people that
don't know one another.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And they all say
that we're headed

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.130 align:middle line:90%
in a really good direction.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:01.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A really
good direction?

00:34:01.835 --> 00:34:03.173 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: A really good one.

00:34:03.173 --> 00:34:03.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When?

00:34:03.973 --> 00:34:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, everything's
going to look really chaotic,

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:84%
but you have to understand that
this is a realm of duality.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have to have
negativity in order to grow.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.050 align:middle line:84%
That's how the human
collective consciousness

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:90%
grows on this Earth planet.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.280 align:middle line:84%
That's just one of the
laws of coming in here.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has to abide by
the laws when you come in.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:84%
But that's how we
grow and learn.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:28.199 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
it, without negativity,

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:31.570 align:middle line:84%
without chaos, there
wouldn't be peace.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like the
Native American symbols,

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:37.830 align:middle line:84%
the symbol of like
the four corners,

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.489 align:middle line:84%
that symbol even symbolize--
that comes from the Pleiades,

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:90%
according to my clients.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.999 align:middle line:90%
But it symbolizes that we all--

00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:47.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That star system
seems to come up a lot.

00:34:47.045 --> 00:34:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yes, it
seems like there

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.940 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of beings
from there helping,

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.929 align:middle line:84%
but we all separated in
order to come back together,

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:84%
but to come back together
greater this time.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:58.900 align:middle line:90%
That is what we're doing.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it unusual,
Sarah, for your clients

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.995 align:middle line:90%
to remember all this?

00:35:02.995 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, usually
they have this sense

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.790 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning of remembering
it for a little while

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:90%
and then it starts to fade.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.870 align:middle line:84%
But if they talk about it,
if they think about it,

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.190 align:middle line:84%
they can keep it in their
awareness a little bit more.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why now, though?

00:35:17.405 --> 00:35:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Because this is what
has been foretold for the ages.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.980 align:middle line:90%
This is the Great Awakening.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Humanity always
goes through cycles.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:30.000 align:middle line:84%
We always evolve in cycles,
not a straight line.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So it looks chaotic, then
we go up into a golden age.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.135 align:middle line:84%
And that is predicted and
aligned with the stars.

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've looked at blood
types in relationship to this.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.995 align:middle line:90%
Tell me why that's important.

00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, it's
really interesting

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:84%
because now, this is
very, very general.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be
these general clues

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that we leave ourselves to help
us really look into ourselves--

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Such as?

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Information.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Like the blood type really
seems to be able to tune

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.170 align:middle line:90%
into information from Atlantis.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So what the
higher-self has said is

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:09.320 align:middle line:84%
that if you have
the O blood type

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and you want to try
to use it as a clue,

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.780 align:middle line:84%
you could maybe go somewhere
close to the Atlantic

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.090 align:middle line:90%
Ocean or even Egypt.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:84%
People with the O blood type
seem to be able to tune in to--

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm O.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:22.725 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, cool.

00:36:22.725 --> 00:36:23.558 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: O positive.

00:36:23.558 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: All right.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So you could tune into
the megalithic structures.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So by going to a
place like Egypt

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:84%
with that type of blood
type, putting your hands

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.070 align:middle line:84%
on some of these
megalithic structures,

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.320 align:middle line:84%
it actually does something
where it activates

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.480 align:middle line:90%
the DNA within your body.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a very general thing.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, it might not
fit for everyone.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:50.070 align:middle line:84%
But like, say, the A and even
AB blood type, a lot of times,

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.760 align:middle line:84%
people with that blood type
carry the Norse traditions

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.450 align:middle line:90%
within their DNA.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So if they were to go, say, to
Glastonbury and put their hands,

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.430 align:middle line:84%
or even just take themselves
and some of these places,

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:03.990 align:middle line:90%
it activates their DNA.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And they could possibly
read some of the information

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:90%
by going there.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.320 align:middle line:84%
There's this telltale
sign that a lot

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.550 align:middle line:84%
of people that are reincarnated
from the fairy realm

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:19.140 align:middle line:84%
have that also have
the A blood type,

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and that's that they're
almost always anemic.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's because there's
this subconscious memory where

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.610 align:middle line:84%
the fairy realm was so against
iron that they programmed

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:84%
themselves and their
future lives to not

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.510 align:middle line:90%
be able to take any iron.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the druids even
would go to this special well

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.534 align:middle line:84%
and in that area of
Glastonbury and drink out of it

00:37:45.534 --> 00:37:46.701 align:middle line:90%
because it was full of iron.

00:37:46.701 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They drink
out of that well.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So it's
really interesting.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Like the Rh negative
bloodline, a lot

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:55.140 align:middle line:84%
of my clients
under hypnosis have

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:84%
said that that's considered
the gift of the stars

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and actually carries a
personality trait to it where

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.740 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people with
this blood type,

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.650 align:middle line:84%
like I said, it's very
general, are natural leaders.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Many of the Pharaohs
had Rh negative blood,

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people remember
that this was symbolizing

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.920 align:middle line:84%
the first set of hybrids
that were a success where

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.420 align:middle line:84%
they knew that this
hybridization program would

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.480 align:middle line:90%
be a success.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But even eye color,
it's so interesting

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.480 align:middle line:90%
how we leave ourselves clues.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm brown.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes so brown--

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:38:32.648 --> 00:38:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So in general, brown
eye color, well, first of all,

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:40.390 align:middle line:84%
our irises show the
blueprint of our soul.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.130 align:middle line:84%
If you look at your iris in the
mirrors, all these little rings

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and stuff, that
shows the blueprint

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.310 align:middle line:90%
of where your soul has been.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, brown eyes
generally signify

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that you've been reincarnated
on the Earth plane

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.120 align:middle line:84%
for a very, very long
time, like, your soul would

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:90%
be considered an old soul.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've used
past life regression

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.935 align:middle line:84%
to help heal patients,
too, haven't you?

00:39:03.935 --> 00:39:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Well, it's very easy.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:06.920 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:84%
- I had a spot on my eye for
19 years, on my right eye.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.150 align:middle line:90%
And it was quite large.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And it interfered
with my vision and it

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:90%
prevented peripheral vision.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:25.100 align:middle line:84%
My eye was viewed
as a foreign body

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and my body was trying to get
rid of my eye, attacked my eye.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:30.720 align:middle line:90%
It was very vicious.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, left with this spot.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm looking at the
moon, a brief second of thought

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:42.990 align:middle line:84%
comes into my head that
oh, the spot is changing.

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.100 align:middle line:90%
It's coming down, it's moving.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Why I didn't think more of
it at the time, I don't know.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:84%
However, in the
morning when I got up

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and I went outside
into the sunlight,

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:84%
everything seemed cleaner
and brighter and bigger.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what's happening?

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I kept running
around looking.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Everything was bigger,
brighter, cleaner.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:06.530 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:10.110 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden I
realized the spot is gone.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:90%
It's completely gone.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:10%
And I looked into the sun,
I looked into the light,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.680 align:middle line:10%
I looked everywhere,
and it wasn't there.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.400 align:middle line:10%
I had complete
peripheral vision.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I was thrilled to
death because, I mean,

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:29.250 align:middle line:84%
this happened without me wanting
it, knowing it, anything in it.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It was a real
testimony to the power

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.430 align:middle line:84%
of the healing and this
workshop and the connections

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:38.780 align:middle line:90%
and the energy.

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And the transformation
was incredible.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.130 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:44.510 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
feel about her journey?

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, the thing
about all this healing

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:84%
is that there's nothing
special about me.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm just doing Dolores
Cannon's method and anybody

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:54.905 align:middle line:90%
can do this method.

00:40:54.905 --> 00:40:56.030 align:middle line:90%
And anybody can experience.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:57.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're not
taking credit for this?

00:40:57.555 --> 00:40:58.615 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: No, because--

00:40:58.615 --> 00:40:59.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, because it really
has nothing to do with me.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just anyone can do this.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
the regressionist.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: But anyone can access
themselves and really heal

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.140 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.432 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So she healed herself.

00:41:13.432 --> 00:41:14.515 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Essentially, yes.

00:41:14.515 --> 00:41:15.315 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:41:15.315 --> 00:41:16.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
nothing to do with it?

00:41:16.945 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Oh no, well,
I'm the facilitator,

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:90%
but still, it's not me doing it.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.050 align:middle line:84%
She did nothing other than
Dolores Cannon's method.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Dolores Cannon was
such a brilliant genius.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew her well.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.000 align:middle line:90%
I knew her well.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.070 align:middle line:90%
I miss her.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.845 align:middle line:90%
How do people get a hold of you?

00:41:34.845 --> 00:41:39.100 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: They can go to my
website theholistichypnotist.com

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.820 align:middle line:10%
and they can find me.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.825 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And what's
new for you next?

00:41:42.825 --> 00:41:45.530 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Well, I'm almost
done my fourth book

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.110 align:middle line:10%
and I'm just having so
much fun because I never

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.060 align:middle line:10%
know what the higher
consciousness will

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:10%
share with me next.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It's always so exciting to be
on this leading edge of thought

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and I get to hear all
these amazing things.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is remarkable.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.175 align:middle line:84%
Sarah, thank you
for what you do.

00:42:01.175 --> 00:42:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Thank you
so much, George.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:90%
What can you say?

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:10%
Past life regressionist
and these people

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.250 align:middle line:10%
come up with all
these amazing stories

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.250 align:middle line:10%
of who they used to
be that leads them

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:10%
into who they are today.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
