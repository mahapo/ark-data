>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.890 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.514 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:13.230 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.453 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:25.409 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and do we have
several great programs for you

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:10%
in store.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:10%
Frank Joseph Hoff is with us.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:84%
He, of course, is the president
of Atlantis Publications,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and he's also a
noted researcher.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be talking
about two regions that

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:10%
were on this planet a long
time ago, Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:10%
Both of these areas,
Frank, have just

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.154 align:middle line:10%
captured the imagination
of everybody, haven't they?

00:00:52.154 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK JOSEPH HOFF: Oh yes.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Well, I
got involved in it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:10%
actually originally when I was
doing some research for Richard

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.287 align:middle line:10%
Hoagland, oddly enough.

00:01:04.287 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good old Richard.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And I had because I had met
him at a Mars conference

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:90%
in Seattle.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up doing
some research for him.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:10%
And when I was doing that, I
came across the unusual work

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:10%
of a Brazilian
professor of academia

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:10%
on the lost continent of
Lemuria, and also of Atlantis,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:10%
on his websites
at www.atlan.org.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
reading the information

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
on the website--
and this goes back

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:84%
into basically the
end of the 1997

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that I ran into the
information when I was

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:90%
doing the research for Richard.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
As I noticed, it was very
unusual work-- very different,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
very logical,
highly scientific--

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Detailed.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Detailed-- regarding
this and the subject

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
was Lemuria and
Atlantis-- that I'd never

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
seen anybody doing that type
of detailed work before.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to looking at his
curriculum vitae or his resume.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And I got to saying, wow, this
man is a nuclear physicist.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:90%
He's a nuclear engineer.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:90%
He also spoke 14 languages.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And then he also took
on the other disciplines

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.700 align:middle line:84%
of archaeology,
anthropology, linguistics,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
etymology-- so he knows what the
derivation and origins of words

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:90%
Also, occultism.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Not that he wanted to
be an occultist per se,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.560 align:middle line:84%
but really so he could really
understand the hidden meanings

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and symbolisms behind
things so he could really

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
uncover the riddle of it,
of Lemuria and Atlantis,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and also Atlantis that
nobody really has ever

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:90%
been known to unravel before.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back at
least 11,600 years ago

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:90%
for Atlantis proper itself.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.237 align:middle line:84%
But Lemuria and Atlantis goes
back closer to 75,000 years.

00:03:05.237 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And this professor
must be one of a kind.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, from
my understanding,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
he sat on all sorts of
boards and committees

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:90%
for energy policy.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
He also used to certify
master's degree students

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:90%
and PhD students.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
He was highly responsible
for the alcohol fuels program

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.630 align:middle line:90%
down in Brazil.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:90%
He had several patents on that.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And what he originally did,
which was very interesting,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:84%
is he originally
went out to dispel

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:90%
the whole notion of Atlantis.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.029 align:middle line:84%
He actually really wanted
to go out and to debunk it.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And he really didn't think
it was anything to it.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.047 align:middle line:84%
He's from, you know,
really pure academia.

00:03:45.047 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: He was, like
I say, a PhD professor

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:90%
in many different disciplines.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A scientist.

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:90%
A true scientist.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: A true scientist, yeah.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And so he had eventually,
after 10 years of research,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.152 align:middle line:84%
started to turn
around 180 degrees.

00:03:58.152 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And when he started to fill
in the rest of the pieces

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
of what is a giant
jigsaw puzzle--

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: --not just like a
couple-of-thousand-piece,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:84%
but like a billion-piece one
that got scattered all around

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
the world-- he had to piece it
all back together so he could

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
get a clear picture of
what Atlantis was all about

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and where its true
original location is,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:90%
as well as Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And so he could really
get a really good look

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
at what the civilization
was all about.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
He didn't try to
cram in the pieces

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
or misfit them or
anything like that,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:90%
but put them in real smoothly.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:90%
And once he started assembling--

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very methodical.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.405 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Very methodical
in the way he did it.

00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And actually
reverse engineer it,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
not back to a colony, a
remnant, or an outpost,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
but to its true original, real
location of where Lemuria was,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:90%
and also where Atlantis is.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.016 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Is he still with us?

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, unfortunately
Professor Santos

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.386 align:middle line:84%
passed away in September--
and I think was 9th of 2005.

00:04:57.386 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh thank
god you've been

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:90%
able to document some of this.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, oddly
enough, it was

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
after he got his
book on Atlantis--

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.060 align:middle line:84%
in this case,
published in English--

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:84%
in just a couple months before
he passed away, when he just

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.875 align:middle line:84%
got placed on--
actually, in this case,

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:90%
it was on amazon.com.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
really, seriously, George,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.862 align:middle line:84%
is a big, huge loss
for the world--

00:05:21.862 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, of course.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.528 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: --for the
knowledge this man had.

00:05:24.528 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And look, I tried to
get him on this show,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
but he got-- what happened is
he ended up damaging his femur

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and his bone in his leg.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think he sat
around too much

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and didn't get enough
circulation going.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:90%
And he ended up passing away.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.955 align:middle line:84%
But he ended up breaking it
going in and out of his house.

00:05:42.955 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.170 align:middle line:90%
That's sad.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about Lemuria, Frank.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with two
distinctive different

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:90%
locations, Lemuria, Atlantis.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
Atlantis in our next program.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:90%
What is Lemuria?

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And why do they call it Lemuria?

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.149 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Great question, George.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And Lemuria, what
it really means,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
is it goes with the word "mu,"
which actually means mother,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:90%
or motherland, in this case.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually the
motherland of civilization.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's where civilization
really began.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Not in Mesopotamia or
Sumeria, but actually

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:84%
in the area of, in
this case, we found out

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
to be Southeast Asia, in and
around the area of Indonesia.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually,
there was not

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
only just the original
civilization that actually got

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
destroyed by a cataclysmic
event, in this case,

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:84%
the Toba volcano, but
they also rebuilt.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And what they had
to do is they had

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to go find the place
after it was basically

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:84%
destroyed in large part by
the Toba volcano into India.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to go there to
basically regather, regroup,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and really rebuild
the other Atlantis.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And just so you know, the
fatherland of civilization

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:90%
is India.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It's more like Pakistan
at this time, where

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the border was-- in and
around the Indus Valley area

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.526 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big do you think
Lemuria might have been?

00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: You mean in terms--

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.733 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In terms of size.

00:07:32.733 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: In size?

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:90%
It was really continental size.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It was probably, actually
bigger than Atlantis itself.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantis is at least the
size of the continental United

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:90%
States--

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.192 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: --with Alaska
and Hawaii combined.

00:07:51.192 --> 00:07:51.775 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: It's huge,
the land area.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So with Lemuria,
approximately when

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.770 align:middle line:90%
did something happen to it?

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask you to
speculate on the people who

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:90%
were on that island.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what kind of
technology did they have?

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because
I've always heard

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:84%
since I was a little boy that
the technology of these places

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:84%
was absolutely unbelievable,
years and years ahead

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
of maybe even what
we have today.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
when did it go down?

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Did it sink?

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Did it just explode?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:90%
What happened to it?

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Approximately
74- to 75,000 years ago,

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle line:84%
the supervolcano
Toba did go off.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And that decimated and
destroyed a lot of the area.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:84%
As far as sinking,
maybe not so much

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:90%
in this case as maybe Atlantis.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And actually it never did sink.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:90%
That's an optical illusion.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.341 align:middle line:84%
It's really that
sea levels rose.

00:08:50.341 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we can
talk more about it.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It didn't go down?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: No.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The waters went up.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.905 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: The waters went up.

00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have this
a couple different times

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:84%
in recent history, with
the Banda Aceh or Aceh

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:84%
area back in
December 26 of 2004,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
when the, I think it was a 9.0,
9.1 earthquake took place up

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.577 align:middle line:90%
in that area.

00:09:13.577 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Huge.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And it set the tsunami up.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
is, and whether it

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.454 align:middle line:84%
be with Lemuria Atlantis
or Atlantis itself,

00:09:21.454 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
is that instead of just sending
a wave of water up maybe 20

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:84%
meters high, at the
time of Atlantis,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.712 align:middle line:84%
it was a little closer to
2,000 meters high in Lemuria.

00:09:34.712 --> 00:09:35.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, meters?

00:09:35.545 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah, meters.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With a force that is
unbelievable, the strength.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Right.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't
know if it's so

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:84%
much in this case with
Lemuria and Atlantis

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
that happened as it did
happen with Atlantis.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But either way, it
sent the water in

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and a great deluge that
ended up reaching up

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:90%
to some of the highest peaks.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But again, what happened
is that water ended up

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
receding eventually,
just like it

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.759 align:middle line:84%
did in this case, the
Aceh area, and other areas

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
of the surrounding
area of Indonesia,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:84%
where we lost almost--
and it's 400,000 people.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But also, when we had
it in Japan in Sendai

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:84%
too, when it went in--
but also, it does recede.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
time period's off,

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
but could this have
been the flood of Noah?

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yes.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:84%
This has a lot to
do with the flood.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And what you have is you have
the great deluge which came in,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's just
the initial flood.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:90%
But that again, it recedes.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's an optical illusion.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you're out in the vessel
and you take a look at it,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
it looks like in
this case, maybe

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria had sank, Lemuria
and Atlantis, or Atlantis.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:90%
But it really didn't.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:90%
It's that sea levels rose.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, and I'll have
to talk to you more about this

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
in another program,
there is also

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
a universal flood that took
place over a period of time

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.482 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:10:52.482 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's really a couple
different types of floods,

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.179 align:middle line:84%
and that's what would
ended up confusing people.

00:10:57.179 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have always
heard that if you're

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
on a ship during
a tsunami, nothing

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.909 align:middle line:84%
happens to you because it's kind
of like this wave, this push.

00:11:04.909 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:84%
But if we're talking
about something that's

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.460 align:middle line:84%
a mile and a half
or 2 miles high,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.439 align:middle line:84%
that's going to wipe out
everything, isn't it?

00:11:11.439 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: And it pretty much did.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:84%
It pretty much started to wipe
out civilization-- maybe more

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:84%
so with Atlantis proper
than it did with Lemuria,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:84%
but basically about
the same thing.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.223 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't that large
a population on Earth.

00:11:25.223 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:90%
The Lemurians--

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at the time.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: --by the way,
were not as advanced--

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
because this is your
question too-- were not

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:90%
as advanced as Atlantis proper.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:84%
They were leading up
to that direction,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and they would have probably
been around for several 100,000

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.260 align:middle line:90%
years, if not a million years.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And they may have even come
from elsewhere as well.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, they
weren't quite advanced.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.394 align:middle line:84%
And before they got really
advanced, they got destroyed.

00:11:53.394 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They got wiped out.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.309 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Wiped out.

00:11:55.309 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:90%
And so they had to rebuild.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
But the key is they
had to rebuild--

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
they had a time to rebuild
over a period of 60,000 years

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:90%
because they used their base--

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.425 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:12:03.425 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: --over in India in order
to do that, and reassemble back

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:90%
to Atlantis proper.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Frank, did
any of them have

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:90%
time to escape this deluge?

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Great question, George.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.084 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned, they went
originally over in India.

00:12:19.084 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:84%
But they went to other parts
of India to begin with.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.800 align:middle line:84%
They got chased out by some
of the locals over there.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But they ended up settling
into that Indus Valley area.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, later on, they went
into some other areas.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And they also were a
worldwide empire anyhow,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
even with Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
But you got to
understand, they had

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to be constrained a lot
of times to that area

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:84%
because it was the middle
of the Pleistocene ice age

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.690 align:middle line:90%
as this was going on.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything was
happening to these poor people

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:84%
If they had ships that
were out, way, way out,

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.180 align:middle line:90%
those people would have been OK.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
When they came back
in those ships,

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.090 align:middle line:90%
what would they have seen?

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Their land would have
been underwater because

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:84%
of the rising sea
levels, which I assume

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.691 align:middle line:90%
was pretty fast too, right?

00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yes.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And with Lemuria and
Atlantis, it probably

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
had to do even more so
with the destruction there

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.340 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of fly ash going
up into the atmosphere

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and also a lot of vaporized
water going up there too.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So this ended up darkening
out the skies for a while too,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:84%
not only in that area, but
probably even worldwide.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
is too, I know it

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
since a lot of these
religious texts

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot talks about having
40 days of rain and so on,

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.192 align:middle line:84%
that relates back
to what was going on

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:38.275 align:middle line:90%
with Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:38.941 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, OK.

00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: And so
that's what came--

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
all went up into the
atmosphere or the stratosphere.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it came down over a
period of time, the 40 days,

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
because all the vaporized
water from the supervolcano

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:90%
all went up in the atmosphere.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:90%
It darkened up the skies.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Also, the fly ash the same way.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And this caused a
big problem, or it

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.231 align:middle line:84%
started to cause a possible
extinction of the human species

00:14:00.231 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the
waters recessed,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
the land kind of
showed again, right?

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yes.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
That's after the initial deluges
that take place, the tsunami.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was left
after the waters receded?

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Nothing?

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Everything was obliterated?

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, what happened
is, is that some of the land

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:90%
appeared again, of course.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people went
up to the upper altitudes

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
of the islands or the continent
of Lemuria and Atlantis, Mu.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.729 align:middle line:84%
But some of them had to disperse
into other areas, like I said,

00:14:42.729 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
India and other places,
where they may have

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:90%
had colonies around the world.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:10%
Again, a lot of things
even got affected

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.730 align:middle line:10%
around the world
because of all the fly

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:10%
ash and the vaporized
water going up too

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:10%
from a number of areas out.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.527 align:middle line:84%
And again, some other
people in other areas

00:14:58.527 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
were affected because it was the
middle of the Pleistocene ice

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.609 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Lemuria-Atlantis,
and Atlantis has

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
to be where it's at,
which is on the equator,

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
so it's in a temperate climate
so a population of 20, 30,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.234 align:middle line:84%
40 million people
can actually survive.

00:15:13.234 --> 00:15:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Not in some other
areas, which are

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:84%
a polar desert in other parts
of the world at that time.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once the ocean
levels receded for Lemuria,

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and you could see the
landmass, where is it today?

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what
happened to it again?

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Something obviously happened.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, some
of it ends up being

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
today in that area of
Southeast Asia's under water.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm speaking about
for Lemuria and Atlantis,

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and even Atlantis proper, is
that it's an area of Indonesia

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and the surrounding area of
Southeast Asia, which comprises

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:84%
also Malaysia, and also even
the Philippines-- might be

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:90%
the far northeastern extension.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And also on the island of
Borneo, you have Kalimantan.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:84%
You have also the
Malaysia side, which is--

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:04.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there are
remnants of Lemuria

00:16:04.455 --> 00:16:05.860 align:middle line:90%
out there, do you think?

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: And Atlantis
proper as well.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, here's the
thing with the two of them.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:84%
They actually are
really one and the same.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
What they did is Lemuria
started off first,

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and it got destroyed
and then was

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.980 align:middle line:84%
rebuilt to Atlantis proper
basically in the same location.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And so there's three
Atlantises, in a sense.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
There's first the
Lemuria-Atlantis,

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.226 align:middle line:90%
which is the original.

00:16:30.226 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:90%
The motherland of civilization.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a fatherland,
which is in this valley area,

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and that's considered maybe
the second, depending on how

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:90%
you look at it, or the third.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.135 align:middle line:84%
The third, or the
second, depending

00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
on how you look at it, is
the Wondrous Son, where

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:90%
they rebuilt Atlantis proper.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So usually, one
way you can think

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:84%
is that it's the father
and the mother first,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and then they have the
offspring, the son.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:90%
But that's one way.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So you could label it Lemuria
and Atlantis is the first one.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.760 align:middle line:84%
The fatherland of
civilization, the Indus Valley,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
is the second one,
the second Atlantis.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And the third one
as the Wondrous Son.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Or you could actually label
it as Lemuria and Atlantis

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.060 align:middle line:84%
is the original one, and at
basically the same spot, they

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.210 align:middle line:84%
rebuilt it again, so you could
consider that the second one.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And the third one would be
the one over in fatherland,

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.310 align:middle line:90%
over in India.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
never gave up, did they?

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:84%
And it just depends
which way you

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
look at it, which is first
and second and third.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
point is, is Lemuria

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and Atlantis and Atlantis
were in the same spot.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter,
it got destroyed,

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and they had to rebuild.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is so romantic
about Lemuria, for example?

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so ingrained
in mythology and legend?

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
We just don't seem
to let go of it.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Well, look.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.470 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, with Lemuria
and Atlantis, Atlantis,

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
is it's the source of most all
religions and most all science

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.555 align:middle line:90%
and most all races.

00:18:05.555 --> 00:18:08.349 align:middle line:90%
It's where civilization began.

00:18:08.349 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that
the Garden of Eden?

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: And it is actually,
it is the birthplace

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:90%
of the Garden of Eden.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is where Garden
of Eden actually is.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what Professor Santos,
Arysio Santos, found out,

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:84%
is that the Garden of Eden was a
garden at Lemuria and Atlantis,

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:90%
the original Atlantis.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not modern-day Iraq?

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: No.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Not Sumeria, not Mesopotamia
or anything like that.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But its discovery now is
from the dawn of antiquity

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and is indeed the true
message of the gospels

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and other holy-type
books and so on.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And its rebirth now is
actually a rebirth back

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:90%
to the golden age of life.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.899 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Satya Yuga.

00:18:55.899 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
have pronounced it

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
any way and nobody would
have questioned you.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.111 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah.

00:19:00.111 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But the Satya Yuga is
like the Hindu meaning

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:90%
for the Golden Age.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And so what it means, that we're
heading back to the Golden Age.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is a rebirth and
going back to that time

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:84%
when things were
peaceful and kind.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And like you say,
Frank, 74,000 years ago.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:84%
What was this planet like
beyond Lemuria, for example,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:90%
74,000 years ago?

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't much.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: No, there wasn't.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And they had to be restrained
to that area because

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
of the climate, the
temperate climate.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're in the middle
of the Pleistocene ice age.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And so they had outposts
in the different areas

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
that they could do
supplying, and they

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
did have different
types of trade routes.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were a
worldwide empire.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But for the most vast
part of the population,

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.120 align:middle line:84%
it couldn't be like in
Antarctica, where they've

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
taken ice core
samples in situ that's

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:90%
been there for 2 million years.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So even today, we have problems
of having, say, 1,000 people

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:84%
down in Antarctica, let
alone more than 20 or 30

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:90%
million people.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any remnants
at all from Lemuria?

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.806 align:middle line:90%
Have they found artifacts?

00:20:16.806 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:90%
You know, vases?

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Anything?

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: There are
different types

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:84%
of artifacts that
are out there that

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:90%
have symbolic signs on them.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%
At least, they have
Atlantean-type descriptions

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether somebody painted
these things up just recently

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.609 align:middle line:84%
based on the
symbolism-- there are

00:20:38.609 --> 00:20:39.900 align:middle line:90%
some things that are out there.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And we do have some, let's say,
drawings or photos or etchings

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.450 align:middle line:90%
of those kind of artifacts.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
really after is to go

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.740 align:middle line:84%
get the real original
artifacts and really start

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:90%
excavating those.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.072 align:middle line:84%
And we are working
on that right now.

00:20:58.072 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:84%
We are starting to come up
with some of those things.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be exciting.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.043 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you, Frank?

00:21:03.043 --> 00:21:04.010 align:middle line:90%
What keeps pushing you?

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Well, look it.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:84%
The way I look at it is
that Professor Santos

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
originally went out to
disprove this whole thing.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.080 align:middle line:84%
He found out after
10 years of research

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
there might be
something worth it.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Another 10 years and filling
in the piece of the puzzle.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And then another 10 years for
30, with part of that with me.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.096 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
obsessed with it?

00:21:25.096 --> 00:21:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: It wasn't obsessed.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a passion to get the
knowledge out to the world

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that's been hidden
for 11,600-plus years,

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:84%
the ending date of
Atlantis proper,

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and goes back to
Lemuria-Atlantis with its

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
ending date around
74-, 75,000 years ago.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So the information,
in a sense, has

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
been held secret for
a number of reasons

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:90%
for all this period of time.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was becoming
upon me to not to let this go

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.835 align:middle line:84%
by the wayside for another
11,600-plus years or more.

00:21:53.835 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We won't
be around then.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: No.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think--

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Look, it's been
long enough, and it's time.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:90%
I represent Professor Santos.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, we represent the
ancient Atlanteans themselves.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.556 align:middle line:84%
And from our information,
they want this information

00:22:11.556 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to get out when we get
up to a certain amount

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:84%
of advanced knowledge, as with
all the computers and sciences

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:84%
now-- that they wanted to
just get this information out.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I'm looking to do,

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
is start to release
it to the public.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a while back,
I was on your show, Coast

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.967 align:middle line:90%
to Coast, to start that process.

00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
the response been?

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Are people accepting
this, or they fighting it?

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, there
are some that,

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
of course, are fighting it,
and we've had to overcome that.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:84%
But look it, this
isn't going away.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.059 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going away
on this whole thing.

00:22:47.059 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
the information out.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So I can tell you straight
out, we're going to do this.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've been over to Indonesia
three different times.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
We've had the support of the
previous president, President

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:10%
And I think we'll
have the support

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:10%
of the new president,
Joko Widodo, who

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:10%
is better known as Jokowi.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:10%
And they've been very
supportive of doing this work,

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:19.307 align:middle line:10%
even though a lot of scientists
in Indonesia were against it.

00:23:19.307 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But they're starting
to come on board,

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.069 align:middle line:84%
and we are starting to bring
up the real evidence now.

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
mentioned there were

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:30.460 align:middle line:84%
a couple of reasons why this was
kind of suppressed, held back.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:90%
What are they hiding?

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, there's
many reasons for this.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it is,
is that the ancients,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and especially when their
homeland is devastated,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:84%
is they wanted to try to
preserve that area because it's

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:84%
a really-- at least with
Atlantis and in Lemuria

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and Atlantis, the
same thing-- a lot

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
of people perished in a
very short period of time.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
sacred ground.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.377 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually the original
holy land for the whole world,

00:24:01.377 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:90%
not the Middle East.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a
huge cemetery, isn't it?

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: It is.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But they also didn't want it
to be pillaged and plundered

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
because of the
riches of Atlantis.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it would have been.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.136 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Yeah,
because it was known

00:24:10.136 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
as the Golden One or the Golden
Peninsula, the Land of Gold.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And also not only gold, but
the copper, the tin, the zinc.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:84%
All these metals are
very precious even today.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Plus all the other resources,
the spice and the frankincense

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and all these different
types of woods and things

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:90%
they have there.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't want it pillaged
and plundered and desecrated.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And also the
strategic metals that

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.509 align:middle line:90%
are used in wars and battles.

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:39.550 align:middle line:84%
If any of their enemies,
when they were weakened,

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
knew about this
location, they would

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.910 align:middle line:84%
be able to go there and
pick up this material,

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
be really in trouble.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.126 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
was valuable then.

00:24:48.126 --> 00:24:49.834 align:middle line:84%
It's even more valuable
today, isn't it?

00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: It's still valuable.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:84%
They still have the
resources today.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And another reason why
that area is great too

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:84%
is because it's not only that
it's a very temperate climate,

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.330 align:middle line:84%
they also have the resources
like volcanic ash or volcanic

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.977 align:middle line:84%
soil, which is really rich
for growing agriculture.

00:25:07.977 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.660 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the best.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.659 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: One of the best.

00:25:10.659 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, they have the
precipitation there.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to grow as
many as three crops per year.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And those crops
typically were rice.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Actually, rice was really--
and agriculture was really

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:84%
invented there, not in Sumeria
or Mesopotamia or China,

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:90%
or some other place.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do the people
of that region today

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.070 align:middle line:84%
feel about the possibility
that Lemuria specifically

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:90%
was out there?

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they really
understand the history

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:42.670 align:middle line:90%
that they have?

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, they've
begun to understand now

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
because of my going there
in 2010 to do a seminar.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:84%
They understand because I also
met with the presidential task

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.970 align:middle line:84%
force that is now their
presidential task force

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:90%
to the president of Indonesia.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They also understand it
more because I was also

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:84%
invited to do a presentation
to the World Cultural

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.872 align:middle line:90%
Forum in Bali.

00:26:05.872 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they're learning?

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.246 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: So they're learning.

00:26:08.246 --> 00:26:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And then with our books being
introduced there too, they

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:90%
also-- and this is one of them.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.371 align:middle line:84%
This one is printed
in Bahasa Indonesia.

00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists
are all beginning

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to start to get
on board, and even

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:84%
do the work that's necessary
and the excavations on this--

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.060 align:middle line:90%
because I had mentioned to them.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.726 align:middle line:84%
I said, when I was
there the first time,

00:26:30.726 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:84%
when I was in Bogor back
in 2010, when I first

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.600 align:middle line:84%
did the presentation, that
maybe it might be a good idea

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:84%
to start looking around
for some ancient artifacts,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.140 align:middle line:90%
and they did.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:39.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Frank, tell me the
best way you can

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:49.900 align:middle line:84%
what the significance of these
ancient lands are to us today.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Well I
think this is really

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:10%
about humanity-- is what
it really comes down to

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:10%
and actually recovering our
past and understanding it.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I think in school,
we are not taught

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
exactly what the real history
and prehistory is, or was.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: And so this is
changing a paradigm.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:12.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a paradigm shift.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:84%
It's an awakening for the
whole world, the public.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:90%
And Indonesia is the caretakers.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
The people of Indonesia
are the caretakers

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:84%
of this lost civilization
and of humanity.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:29.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's really humanity, not
just for the Indonesian people

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:84%
or the people around the
Philippines or Malaysian people

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:90%
but for the whole world.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they're
the caretakers of it.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
really starting

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:90%
to get on board with this.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean our book,
when we introduced it

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
in Bahasa Indonesia, was one
of the top-selling books in all

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:90%
of Indonesia.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must have
gone crazy with this, huh?

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: It was shocking.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, when I was on your
show the first time around too,

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:90%
the word started getting out.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.380 align:middle line:84%
In addition, I mentioned
this to you before, George,

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that I ended up-- and I didn't
start off this way-- marrying

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.260 align:middle line:90%
a lady from Indonesia.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:90%
It was Indonesia whose--

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is she descended
from Lemuria? [LAUGHS]

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, I think there
could be a possibility.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But you know, that's
tracking the DNA, which

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.230 align:middle line:84%
can be rather tough, but I
don't know if it's impossible.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But my wife is Sunda,
and this ancient land

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:90%
is known as Sundaland.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:24.979 align:middle line:90%
And she speaks Sunda.

00:28:24.979 --> 00:28:25.812 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How ironic.

00:28:25.812 --> 00:28:26.353 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah.

00:28:26.353 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And she also speaks the
language of Indonesia,

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
which is called Bahasa
Indonesia and another one

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:84%
called Betawi and a little
bit of Javanese and of course,

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.690 align:middle line:90%
now English.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
I'm the messenger

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:84%
for Professor Santos on this and
also for the ancient Lemurians

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.355 align:middle line:90%
and Atlantis-Lemurians now.

00:28:49.355 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sure you've done
him proud, let me tell you.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, I'm trying
to do the best I can.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:10%
We're really just at
the tip of the iceberg.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:10%
But I just want to say
this to your listeners--

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:00.890 align:middle line:10%
we're not going away.

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to
the bottom of this.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
changing our website.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.520 align:middle line:90%
We've changed it a bit now.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going to change
it a whole lot more.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If people want
information on you,

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:90%
where do they go?

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Well, they
go to our website,

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:19.200 align:middle line:10%
which is at www.atlan.org.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
We have our book out
in English on Atlantis,

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:90%
and it covers Lemuria too.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's called--

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
this one right here.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Yeah, that one there.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:29:28.556 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: "Atlantis, The Lost
Continent Finally Found,"

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.885 align:middle line:84%
with the subtitle "The
Definitive Localization--"

00:29:33.885 --> 00:29:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk a lot about
Atlantis in our next program,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.911 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Sure.

00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:90%
And one other thing too...

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:40.130 align:middle line:90%
last book.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.970 align:middle line:90%
This is on Lemuria.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.489 align:middle line:90%
The original book back in 1995.

00:29:43.489 --> 00:29:44.530 align:middle line:90%
It's still in Portuguese.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:84%
We're looking to
print it in English.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's on Lemuria
and Atlantis, Atlantis,

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.139 align:middle line:90%
and alchemy.

00:29:50.139 --> 00:29:51.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:52.310 align:middle line:90%
You're getting the word out.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:10%
We're going to come back in our
next program on "Beyond Belief"

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.130 align:middle line:10%
and talk about Atlantis
with Frank Joseph Hoff.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.020 align:middle line:10%
Keep watching.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:90%
