00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.028 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:09.236 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:11.333 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.902 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
back to "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.230 align:middle line:10%
with Olav Philips, a conspiracy
researcher, our special guest

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.432 align:middle line:10%
tonight.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
talking about a subject

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that I have investigated,
and it's probably still

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:84%
one of the most frightening
stories I've ever come across.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1960s
and into the '70s,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:84%
there was somebody called
the Zodiac Killer up

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.297 align:middle line:90%
in northern California.

00:00:49.297 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
He got his name, of course,
by some of the symbols

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.540 align:middle line:84%
that he sent to newspapers
in the Bay Area.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:84%
He's responsible for
killing at least five

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:84%
people but maybe up to 28
people, maybe 37 people.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really knows.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Olav, one of the most
frightening stories

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.274 align:middle line:84%
that hit this country
in a long, long time.

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>OLAV PHILLIPS: Absolutely.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:10%
The Zodiac, even to this
day, is frightening.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:10%
Because there was never
really proper closure.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:10%
And it's one of those things
in the Bay Area, you know,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:10%
it really stained the
San Francisco Bay Area

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:10%
quite significantly.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
question about it.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
This individual, this
person, this freak,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.450 align:middle line:84%
would literally push
the police departments.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:90%
And he loved publicity.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: He loved--
I mean, he called them.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
There are at least
two instances where

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
he called the
dispatcher and a second

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:84%
where he called a very
famous radio program, radio

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:90%
host in the Bay Area.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.775 align:middle line:90%
He had a TV show at the time.

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
He called into it.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.992 align:middle line:90%
He's like, I'm the Zodiac.

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JIM DUNBAR: Tell us what's
going on inside you right now,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Sam.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.506 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:00.482 align:middle line:90%
>>SAM: I have headache.

00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:01.482 align:middle line:90%
>>JIM DUNBAR: All right.

00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:04.954 align:middle line:84%
>>MELVIN BELLI: How long have
you had those headaches, Sam?

00:02:04.954 --> 00:02:07.434 align:middle line:90%
Been a long time?

00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:08.755 align:middle line:90%
>>SAM: Since I killed a kid.

00:02:08.755 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MELVIN BELLI: If it all
boils down to the question that

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
you're giving yourself up if
you could be assured that you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.959 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't get capital
punishment for myself--

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SAM: No, I wouldn't
give myself up.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.333 align:middle line:90%
>>MELVIN BELLI: Huh?

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.145 align:middle line:90%
>>SAM: I wanna kill those kids.

00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
think that was real?

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: I do.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's his whole MO.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he kind of bait
the police and bait the media?

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: He baited everybody.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.970 align:middle line:84%
He sent them
cryptograms, saying, OK,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.400 align:middle line:84%
if you can figure
out this code, it'll

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
tell you who the next
person I'm going to kill is.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Or if you can figure
out this code,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.740 align:middle line:90%
it'll tell you where I am.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So constantly he would
send them letters

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and do things to try to--
he would do things out

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:90%
in the open.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.722 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was really, really,
really trying to get caught.

00:02:56.722 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And they just couldn't do it.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
They just could not
crack what he was doing.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wanted to get caught
without wanting to get caught.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:90%
He was taunting them.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm a specialist in
serial killers, far from it.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But out of all the serial
killers I've ever seen,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%
he was the one that taunted
the police the most.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Most of these guys,
they're very quiet.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:90%
They just do the thing.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:90%
He was out there.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.142 align:middle line:84%
He was pushing the
police quite often.

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Frustrating
for them, wasn't it?

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.308 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Incredibly
frustrating.

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:90%
I think it still is frustrating.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Because there are other ideas
and thoughts and theories

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.922 align:middle line:90%
of who he was.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are a
handful of suspects.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.379 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: There's a
handful of suspects,

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:90%
a few really strong ones.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.327 align:middle line:84%
But even to this day,
it's still an open case.

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I think
hurt the investigation, Olav,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.610 align:middle line:84%
is you did have a lot of
people come in saying,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
my father-in-law was
the Zodiac Killer.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:90%
This guy was the Zodiac Killer.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.230 align:middle line:90%
My friend was the Zodiac Killer.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And so when you had three or
four different people coming

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
in with three or four different
sources, of which evidence

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
they found little pieces
of what could be true--

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:84%
whether the handwriting matched
the letters, whether a DNA

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:84%
portion matched
something else, like

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
who licked the stamp
and things like that.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It must have been a very
frustrating for police.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: You know, I think
it was the whole 80/20 rule

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:90%
enacted in real life, right?

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
This notion that you can
get 80% of the way there,

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.855 align:middle line:84%
but that last 20%, you
just can't conquer it.

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:36.025 align:middle line:84%
And so every time,
they're getting close.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:37.064 align:middle line:90%
They're getting close.

00:04:37.064 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:90%
They're getting close.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:90%
But they're falling away.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:90%
They're falling away.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:84%
They can never get over the
hump to actually nail it.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
was probably one

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.560 align:middle line:90%
of the most frustrating things.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
There are people
in the police that

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:84%
had spent their entire careers
trying to understand why he did

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
it, what he did exactly,
because nobody's entirely

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
sure, as you pointed out, how
many people he actually killed?

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And were they all
in the Bay Area?

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people that
have done research that claimed

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that he murdered
people in Oregon,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:84%
that he murdered
people in Nevada, Utah,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.727 align:middle line:84%
that he went to the East
Coast and murdered people.

00:05:14.727 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And may still be alive.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.476 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And may still be
alive, murdering more people.

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Murdering
more, exactly.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Did he kill in
couples primarily?

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:90%
As opposed to individuals?

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: He did do
a couple of couples

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:10%
and a couple of individuals.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So he was
all over the map?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:10%
The one thing that I've
never really understood

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:10%
is how he selected his targets.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it random?

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I don't think
it was entirely random, no.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about them that--

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think he knew them?

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.844 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I
think he knew them,

00:05:47.844 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
or I think that they
represented something to him,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:84%
or they had some
feature of them that he

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.067 align:middle line:90%
disliked for some reason.

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with every serial
killer, something's happened.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: There's
something there.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they
were little kids.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.008 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know that sounds
really broad and nebulous.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the Zodiac is
that it is broad and nebulous.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:84%
By its very nature, it's
completely broad and nebulous.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.389 align:middle line:84%
You've got bodies,
but that's it.

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
You've got bodies and letters
and a couple phone calls.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's really all you got.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of the suspects
was a newspaper editor.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that case.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, that's
Richard Gaikowski.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:10%
He was a reporter.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.091 align:middle line:10%
He was an editor of
a little newspaper

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:10%
in Martinez, California.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.052 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.052 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I want to say he was also an
editor at "Good Times," which

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
was a very volatile newspaper
in San Francisco as well.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why was he a suspect?

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, he
was in the right places

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:90%
at the wrong times, so to speak.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.369 align:middle line:90%
He had training.

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:52.243 align:middle line:84%
There was at least-- if
I remember correctly,

00:06:52.243 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
one of the murders, there
were something very technical

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
about it that they believed
that the individual had

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
to have some medical
training because

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:90%
of the way it was carried out.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:90%
He was a trained army medic.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
timings and locations

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.290 align:middle line:90%
that fit very well for him.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:84%
He also, as a
reporter, had written

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:84%
a series of very bizarre
articles, at least

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:90%
at the Martinez newspaper.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
He had written very
bizarre articles.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About the victims?

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: No, about
things in general.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:84%
One instance where a
person was attacked

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and he explained
the way the person

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.606 align:middle line:84%
was attacked in terms of eating,
like Thanksgiving dinner.

00:07:34.606 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost as
if he was writing it

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective
of the attacker?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.935 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:07:40.935 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:84%
That happened a number
times, at least in Martinez.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like he was there.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Like he was there,
or like he could visualize it.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
If he wasn't there,
he was definitely

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:90%
visualizing what was happening.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.982 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it public
that he was a suspect?

00:07:55.982 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: I believe it was.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.555 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's been referred to
in books and things nowadays.

00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And he's dead now?

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.206 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: He's dead.

00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:90%
He died in 2004 of cancer.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.014 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he seems
to still come back?

00:08:08.014 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Apparently, yes.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's going on?

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: So one of the
places that he was an editor

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:84%
was a little
newspaper in Martinez,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
California called "The
Martinez News Gazette."

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, he haunts the
building, that his ghost--

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He haunted
the building?

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: He
haunts the building.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does he do?

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: He does
a lot of things.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.880 align:middle line:90%
He moves things around.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:90%
He pushes people.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:90%
He hits them.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:90%
He turns lights on and off.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:90%
He breaks things.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe the
Zodiac Killer's still around

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.200 align:middle line:90%
in some form or fashion?

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah,
basically, yes.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So we, me and some
other people, we

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
went to The Martinez
News Gazette,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.625 align:middle line:84%
and we attempted to
contact Gaikowski.

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And were
you successful?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: We were.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.446 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: At first,
when we got there,

00:09:05.446 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
it gets interesting.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.819 align:middle line:84%
We first got there,
nothing happened.

00:09:10.819 --> 00:09:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you went
there with the intent

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:90%
of contacting his spirit?

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yes, and
confronting him, as much

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:84%
as that's possible
to a ghost, right?

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
a notion that you

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
go into a haunted house, and
things start spinning around.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.857 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the way it is.

00:09:30.857 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when you go
into a haunted house, nothing

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens for a long time.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.931 align:middle line:90%
And there's this magic 3 a.m.

00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:90%
number.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly at 3 a.m. things
start to come unglued.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't always
happen either.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
You could go an
entire investigation

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:90%
and never see a thing.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it
started out very slowly,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:90%
but not a lot was going on.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
person in particular

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
who worked at the
newspaper who he targeted.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And he would push her around,
and rearrange her desk

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And so she tried to--
she called him out.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And she reminded him that,
hey, we're filming this.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And the minute she said,
hey, we're filming this

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to try to talk
about this with other people,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:84%
then suddenly, things
start to happen.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
he knew that he

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:84%
was going to get some
notoriety from it that he

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:90%
started actually to do things.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think
he would want to continue

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:90%
haunting the Martinez Gazette?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, the thing
about the Martinez Gazette

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:84%
is that by all accounts,
he was happiest there.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.189 align:middle line:84%
It's a little newspaper
in a little town.

00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:43.021 align:middle line:84%
It's actually one of
the oldest newspapers--

00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it his newspaper?

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: No, but
he was the editor,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and he had a lot
of freedom there.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly he was
pretty happy there.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a very old newspaper.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you
go to the Gazette,

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
they actually have
a copy of the issue

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:84%
they put out that announced
that Abraham Lincoln had

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:90%
been assassinated.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.604 align:middle line:90%
It's an extremely old newspaper.

00:11:03.604 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still around?

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Still around, yeah.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:10%
And I think the age of it,
and the freedom that he had,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:10%
and the flexibility that
he had, he liked it.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:90%
And so he came back there.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I think in some ways it
represented to him good times.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
But even as it
represents good times,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:90%
he still did evil things.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.882 align:middle line:84%
So you can't divorce the
fact that he is evil.

00:11:30.882 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
anything that he

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:84%
did in the afterlife
that would lead

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.840 align:middle line:84%
you to believe that he might
have been the Zodiac Killer?

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.916 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Well, we
started to taunt him.

00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On purpose?

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: On purpose.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Not a wise move.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a wise move at all.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And we started to
hear-- there's a drop ceiling.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And they have those panels.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
We heard things moving around
in the crawl space up above us.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And we went up there, and
we started to film it.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And we got a shadow
person moving around

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:90%
inside the crawl space.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could feel that?

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: You could feel it.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.083 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of equipment did you

00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:13.333 align:middle line:90%
bring for something like that?

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: We
brought EM generators.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:84%
We brought thermal cameras,
normal cameras, SP7 boxes,

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:84%
pretty much all
the normal stuff.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes when you're
on an investigation like that,

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
the little ghostly apparition
starts playing around

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.737 align:middle line:90%
with the equipment.

00:12:31.737 --> 00:12:32.695 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Definitely.

00:12:32.695 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, pulling
power and things like that.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Did you have anything
strange happen there?

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.111 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah,
he actually blew up

00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:90%
one of our EM field generators.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.037 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:12:40.037 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, he blew it up.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
We were down below, and we
could hear him moving around

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.250 align:middle line:84%
up there, continuing
to taunt him,

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:90%
of course, which is unwise.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
what a spirit box is.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: That's an SP7.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a small device that
has a frequency skipper.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what it does
it cycles through all

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.870 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies in the FM band.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is, you
ask the spirit questions

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and then the spirit can speak
through it, which shouldn't

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
happen, because it's skipping
through the radio stations

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.577 align:middle line:84%
so fast you can't
make out words.

00:13:09.577 --> 00:13:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's kind of a
bizarre aspect of all of this,

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.600 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.308 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:13:13.308 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, using the
spirit box, we actually

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:84%
got him in his own words to
admit that he was the Zodiac.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.589 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
very significant.

00:13:20.589 --> 00:13:22.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other
strange things might

00:13:22.255 --> 00:13:25.051 align:middle line:90%
have happened out there, Olav?

00:13:25.051 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: He was moving
things, turning lights

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:90%
on and off.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the people that was
involved in the investigation

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
actually became overwhelmed
and had to go outside.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that happened twice
to two different people.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he wrote stories
about the Zodiac Killer,

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:84%
did he write stories better
than any other media out there?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: That's
my understanding.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
He did, I believe, do
a couple stories on it.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And he also talked to a guy that
he worked with at "Good Times."

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And he seemed to have a
little too much knowledge

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:90%
of what had happened.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
would he say things

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:84%
like, you can only imagine what
was going through the victims'

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.820 align:middle line:84%
minds when the
Zodiac Killer came up

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
on the left side of a car
and appeared into the window?

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, according to
the guy who's the informant who

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:90%
he worked with at "Good Times."

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.392 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody turned him in?

00:14:21.392 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.891 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll talk
about that in a second.

00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, but
according to that guy,

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.430 align:middle line:84%
he would say, yeah,
isn't it strange

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
how he pointed them to the
north, the bodies to the north?

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:90%
And who would know that?

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Only
the Zodiac Killer.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The cops must
have read his columns

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and said, how in the heck does
this guy know that the victims

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.179 align:middle line:90%
were pointed toward the north?

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, but I think--

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:49.594 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a red flag.

00:14:49.594 --> 00:14:54.601 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: It's a red flag, but
I think that also he was smart,

00:14:54.601 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
so I think he could
explain it away.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.731 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Plus, he's a remote
viewer or a psychic, right?

00:14:58.731 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Right.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.271 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:15:00.271 --> 00:15:01.579 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Ah, you never know.

00:15:01.579 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.484 align:middle line:84%
What other strange occurrences
when you were investigating?

00:15:05.484 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: We had flashlights
that would turn on and off.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
We actually got to a
point where we had set up

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:84%
a series of flashlights, and
we could ask him questions

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and get him to turn the
flashlights on and off.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
felt his presence?

00:15:20.355 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: The temperature,
once he became active,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:84%
the temperature in the place
dropped by at least 15 degrees.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of all the
suspects that are out there,

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and like I said, there's
a handful of them,

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:84%
would you say that he might
have been the biggest suspect?

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.412 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Listening to
him talk on the SP7, I mean,

00:15:39.412 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:90%
it's very pointed.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:90%
He says, I am the Zodiac.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:90%
He's very clear.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And all the communications
that we had through the SP7

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:84%
or in other ways
were very clear.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:90%
His intent was very clear.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.652 align:middle line:84%
When I was in that
building, and it's not

00:15:54.652 --> 00:15:56.693 align:middle line:84%
a big building, but when
I was in that building--

00:15:56.693 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
building's still there?

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: The building's
still there, yeah.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And the newspaper's
still in the building.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.886 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it scare
you when you were there?

00:16:02.886 --> 00:16:04.004 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
don't get scared?

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: No.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.130 align:middle line:84%
More than any haunted
location I've ever been to,

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:90%
you could just feel it.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Evil.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: You could
feel the malevolence.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pure, pure evil.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: And when
he was doing things,

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:90%
he was messing with you.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And you knew that he
was messing with you.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
You knew that he was there,
and he was after you.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Olav, if
somebody like that

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.389 align:middle line:84%
reincarnates-- I believe
in reincarnation.

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
There's just too many
strange stories about that.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: No, I do as well.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:34.991 align:middle line:90%
I do as well.

00:16:34.991 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's assume
he reincarnates.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Does he come back better?

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Or does he come back
as the Zodiac Killer,

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
and he does it all over again?

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I like to
believe that if and when

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:84%
we reincarnate, that we do it
to learn from our past mistakes,

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.540 align:middle line:90%
to make us better people.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So I want to believe that
if he were to reincarnate,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
that he would
reincarnate in a way that

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:84%
would make him a better person
and to atone for the evil

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.454 align:middle line:90%
that he had done.

00:17:06.454 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, let's
make an assumption.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:08.787 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Sure.

00:17:08.787 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just an assumption
that the Zodiac Killer is still

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:90%
alive.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:90%
He would be in his '70s.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.115 align:middle line:90%
Could he still be killing?

00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, he could.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
scary thought though.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:21.845 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: He could.

00:17:21.845 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:84%
He absolutely could if he
took take care of himself

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.541 align:middle line:84%
and he wasn't suffering
from dementia or something.

00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, the
FBI says at any given

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
time there are 50 serial
killers roaming the country.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe that?

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Killing anywhere from two to
God knows how many people.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: I can.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I can believe it.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's disturbing.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It is disturbing.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.021 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Zodiac Killer
had short hair, had glasses.

00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>PHILLIPS: Had glasses.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does Robert
fit that bill?

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.250 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.111 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The sketch came from a
victim who did not die, right?

00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:56.235 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: That's correct.

00:17:56.235 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:10%
Who got away.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.915 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It was female?

00:17:58.915 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: It was a woman.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.230 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Only person I think who
would be able to identify him.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Only person who
ever actually saw him, clearly

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:90%
saw him.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They did not have,
obviously, enough evidence

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:10%
to arrest him or to
even have a trial.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:10%
How come?

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: I mean,
he was careful.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
There was only the one time,
I think, with the taxi driver

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:90%
that he was hurried.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Zodiac
Killer was very careful.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.926 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't a lot of evidence.

00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about the taxi driver.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: He
attacked a taxi driver.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To kill?

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: I think
it was accidental.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:42.204 align:middle line:84%
I think he just got confronted,
and he-- yeah, he killed him.

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:42.972 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:18:42.972 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Was he trying to get
away from something?

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.638 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILLIPS: Yeah, I think
he was trying to run,

00:18:46.638 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:90%
and the guy got in his way.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle line:90%
And he had mistimed something.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:84%
But the thing
about the Zodiac is

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
that the reason that
he lasted so long

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:90%
is because he was careful.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we really
didn't have DNA then.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:10%
>>PHILLIPS: No, there
was no DNA then.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:10%
And he positioned things.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:09.075 align:middle line:10%
He created the crime scene.

00:19:09.075 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:90%
He would go in.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
He would put the bodies
where he wanted them.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
He'd cover the bodies
the way he wanted them.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:15.706 align:middle line:90%

is indeed still around.
