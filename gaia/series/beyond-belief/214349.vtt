>>GEORGE NOORY: We have
an amazing "Beyond Belief"

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:10%
program for you.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.780 align:middle line:10%
James Clarkson with us has
been a MUFON investigator

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:10%
for more than 30 years,
and has studied more

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:10%
than 2000 UFO reports.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
He's also the author of
"Tell My Story, June Crain,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.570 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force and UFOs" and
"Westport UFO Crash Retrieval

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Event."

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Jim, good to have
you on the program.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES CLARKSON: It's
a pleasure to be here.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
started as a MUFON investigator?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Well, that's because
of actually being in the US Army

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Military Police.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you for
serving, by the way.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: And
thank you as well.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So since
you've been doing this,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:84%
you got involved more
and more in this, right?

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:10%
I was a plainclothes
military policeman

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:10%
at Fort Lewis, Washington,
between 1974 and 1977.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And one night while
I was on duty,

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I was chatting with
the desk sergeant

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and he had a big Plexiglass
on his desk and phones,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:90%
but all these papers and things.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:10%
And I glanced down at a business
card that said National UFO

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:10%
Reporting Center 206-722-3000.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, that's
kind of strange.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at
the desk sergeant,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.960 align:middle line:90%
and I said, Sarge, what is this?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's
where we report UFOs.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Peter
Davenport's organization.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: And it
did become-- he's

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:90%
been a lifelong friend of mine.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:84%
He's been a friend and a man I
admire totally for many years.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very dedicated.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.942 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you wrote
this book about June Crain.

00:01:55.942 --> 00:01:56.742 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Right.

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about June.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Well, I started
doing UFO presentations

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
in public libraries at the
recommendation of my wife.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And in 1993, she asked me
to do a program at the Ocean

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Shores, Washington Library, on
the Southwest Washington Coast.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And I went there, there
was 30 to 40 people there.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I was all done, basic
information about UFOs, history,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot, a very stern
looking elderly woman,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:84%
walked up to me, looked me
right in the eye, and she said,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:90%
you're right.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The government knows
all about UFOs,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:90%
and they're keeping it a secret.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
how do you know?

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And she said, because
I worked there.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: There
was no hesitancy.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:90%
So I said, please, tell me more.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And then she kind of looked
at me very wary, and she said.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I can't because they'll
come and arrest me.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that she was
worried about me arresting her,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
keep it a secret

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
that although I was in a
library talking about UFOs,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
my regular day job, I was a
detective sergeant for a police

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:90%
department in a nearby city.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But she had
a signed obligation

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:90%
form with the military.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Yes, she did, a
non-disclosure agreement that

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
said that she could be sent to
prison or fined $10,000 if she

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:84%
disclosed anything that she
saw or heard while she worked

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:84%
at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a picture
of her obligation right there.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARKSON: That I believe
is her early notice, that

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:10%
proves her employment.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:10%
But yes, I do have
a document that

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:10%
shows her non-disclosure
agreement signed

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:10%
by her at the time that she
left their employment in 1952.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did she take
secrets with her?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Maybe some,
but it would have been

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:90%
because she forgot to tell me.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the book itself is
pretty comprehensive, isn't it?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: It is based on
a series of conversations

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:84%
that I had with her, because in
1993, she would not talk to me.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It took her four years to
decide to even talk to me.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason,
ironically, that she

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:84%
talked to me is because the Air
Force published a book in 1997

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:90%
that said Roswell, case closed.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So out of the blue, it was all
over CNN, a national news story.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And out of the blue,
I get a phone call,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:90%
and it's June on the phone.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:90%
I knew her voice.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I knew it couldn't
be anybody else.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing she said
is, it's a lie with a few--

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was
incensed, wasn't she?

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: She was very angry.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it's
the balloon lie.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the same lie that we
used when I worked there.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, tell me more.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And this opened
up conversations.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not that slow.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, how soon
can I be at your house?

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I started visiting
her, and we became friends.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And she showed me
her personal papers.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually
verified those papers

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
by contacting the
National Personnel Records

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Center in Saint Louis.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I got copies of
all of It, took me five tries.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That ended up
burning down, by the way.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Yes, that was one
of the excuses they gave me.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What percent of
the things that she knew,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:90%
do you think she told you?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: That's hard to say.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:90%
I would say maybe--

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd guess if I had to put a
number on it, I'd say a third.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:84%
There were things that
she didn't remember

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and things that may have
slipped her mind over the years.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:84%
It was 50 years between the
events that are described.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And when she was
recalling them for me,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
she was recalling those events
for me at the end of her life.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
But she was telling me if she
couldn't remember something,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:90%
she said, I don't remember.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And if I asked her a question,
she would say, I don't know.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, as an
investigator, is very important.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I like witnesses that
know what they don't know.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Not people
who know everything.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Those ones worry me.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What didn't she
tell you, in your opinion?

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: It's conceivable
that she had more than one

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:90%
direct experience.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would've liked to have
known more about how she arrived

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:84%
at telling me that
by the time she

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
left the employment
of the Air Force,

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force had not one
crash-recovered UFO but three.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From where?

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: She didn't know
the other two for sure.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:90%
We had Roswell.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
She thought that Kingman,
Arizona, was a possibility.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.163 align:middle line:84%
And she really wasn't
sure about the third one.

00:06:46.163 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe Cape
Girardeau, Missouri?

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: That's conceivable.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting now.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a little piece of metal
that an officer showed her.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:90%
You found out about this.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: That's one
of the favorite stories.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:90%
June is in her office.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And part of this story, you have
to think about the psychology

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:90%
of the situation.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
She's the only woman
in an all-male office

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
of military people,
engineers, scientists.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And she's an attractive
young woman, kind of witty,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.225 align:middle line:90%
and quick on the uptake.

00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very bubbly.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
An officer comes into her
office, reaches into his pocket,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
pulls out this piece
of metal, and says,

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:90%
hey, June, you're a good worker.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Tear this up.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Get those scissors.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.660 align:middle line:90%
See what you can do.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
she can't cut it.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:90%
She can't poke a hole in it.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:90%
She can't scratch it.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:84%
She wads it up into a ball,
and it weighs like nothing.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:84%
She lets it go,
and it springs back

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to its original shape like
water with no wrinkles,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:90%
no evidence of being touched.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've heard that story.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was her.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I think she's
one of the people who

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:90%
handled the memory metal.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, she asked this officer,
she said, what is this?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And he bends down, and he says
it's a piece of a spaceship.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:90%
She says, what is it really?

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a piece of a spaceship.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And about that time, somebody
else walks through the area,

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and he grabs it and sticks
it in his pocket and pretends

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:90%
like he wasn't talking to her.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you think
that material is today?

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: I wish I knew.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I wish that June had given
me a piece before she passed.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it is.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to put
a lie detector test on June

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.860 align:middle line:84%
at the time, would
she have passed.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I believe she would
have without any hesitation,

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:90%
based on my experience.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm also basing this on 30
years of interviewing witnesses,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:90%
suspects, victims, et cetera.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't pretend to be
a perfect lie detector,

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:84%
but I have some experience
with figuring out when

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:90%
people are making stuff up.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, as
I am sitting here,

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.090 align:middle line:84%
that June was a
totally honest person.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, was
there a pilot involved

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.375 align:middle line:90%
who saw some things, bodies?

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: One
of these stories,

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
she had several of
these key stories.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
One of them was that she
knew a Master Sergeant who

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
was a crewman on a military
cargo aircraft that

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.930 align:middle line:90%
flew into Wright-Patterson.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
coffee with these people.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
They all had
security clearances.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So they're having
coffee with the pilot.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
weird conversations.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about flying
in with wreckage and bodies.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And everybody at the table
wants to know whether or not

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
the bodies were victims of
people that they might know.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
He suddenly jumped and
looked at them and said.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't realize,
they're not human.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about pilots
or crewmen who died in a crash.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And then he went on
to describe them,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that they had bodies
like child-size,

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:90%
with enlarged heads, et cetera.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
different people.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Were involved in
this story, Jim?

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: I'm not sure.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.445 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many people were

00:10:19.445 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:84%
sitting in that room with her
when she talked to the pilot.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:26.150 align:middle line:84%
My sense was, it was a group
of people having coffee.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There still must
be many of them alive.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: I don't know.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It would be stretching
it now, because we

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
are losing so many
of the witnesses,

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:90%
if we haven't lost them already.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
from the West Coast?

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know about the
Westport, Washington, case

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:90%
of '79?

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I was a rookie
policeman in the year 1979,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:84%
hired by the City of
Aberdeen, Washington.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
If I had taken the newspaper,
which I didn't, because I was--

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a clip
of that newspaper, too.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.635 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There it is.

00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARKSON: I would have seen
that headline on November 26

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:10%
of 1979, and that would
have gotten my attention.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:10%
It's the first of
five news articles

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.950 align:middle line:10%
on this particular event.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:10%
And what they're referring to is
the night before, November 25,

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:10%
1979, at 10:50 PM, some kind of
object came down out of the sky

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:10%
over Grays Harbor County,
headed for the area of Westport,

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:10%
and specifically the
Elk River estuary.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:10%
And people started calling in.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:10%
I talked to dispatchers
in law enforcement,

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:10%
because I was still
a police officer when

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:10%
I was investigating this.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.098 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got
you involved in that?

00:11:46.098 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Well, this
was years later when

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.880 align:middle line:90%
I had become a MUFON member.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: So by then, I
was kind of like, OK, well,

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
what can I do to
establish myself in MUFON?

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then you were
credentialed to do that, right?

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And also, because when I
first became a policeman,

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't dare talk
to my fellow officers

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.060 align:middle line:84%
about my interest
in UFOs and aliens.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But after about three or four
years, I was established,

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't worried
about it anymore.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So I finally
started telling them

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
that I was interested
in this field.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I got
tinfoil hats and all of that.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
But they also started telling me
something crashed by Westport.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to the library,
they had a whole file on it,

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.480 align:middle line:84%
because they'd been asked
about it so many times.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And I started with those
five newspaper articles.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.432 align:middle line:84%
And that gave me all the leads I
needed to open an investigation.

00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other
major witnesses

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.238 align:middle line:90%
reported what they saw?

00:12:46.238 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Well,
when I dug into it,

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I found a lady in Central
Park named Stella Crusseu.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I was especially
interested in her

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
because she appeared
to have almost a--

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know this
for sure, but it

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:84%
seemed like she had a psychic
connection, because she recalled

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:84%
watching a TV program, having
it interrupted by something

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
going across the sky, across
two different windows--

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On her television?

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: No, it was in the
windows behind the television,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:90%
facing the outdoors.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And for her, it was almost
like time slowed down.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.375 align:middle line:84%
And she described
a vehicle to me.

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it is.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Exactly.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.232 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that, right?

00:13:27.232 --> 00:13:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: That's an artist's
representation of the craft

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that she saw going
across the sky.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was not a meteor?

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I don't see how
it could be with windows.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And the thing was, she
made interesting comments.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Her comment was, I kept
thinking, they're in trouble.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:90%
They're going down.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:90%
They're going down.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So it was almost like she picked
up a distress call in her mind.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
know that for sure,

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.090 align:middle line:90%
but that's how it sounded to me.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was Allan Reymer?

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Ahh.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Allan Reymer was
the most interesting

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:90%
of all the witnesses.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I
have a development

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that I'll mention briefly
that just happened yesterday,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of fact, in
connection with Allan Reymer.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
He was a scientist employed by
the State Department of Natural

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Resources, and he would
do public outreach

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:84%
on all the marine life in
Puget Sound up in Washington.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:84%
He was a very popular
public speaker.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, he wrote a
report based upon

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
not what he saw on Sunday night
when the object came down,

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:90%
but what he saw on Monday night.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we
have a testimony,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
video where you're
talking to him,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.920 align:middle line:84%
and he's describing the
lights that he saw in the sky.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Exactly.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLAN REYMER: From that
point, I headed home to Westport

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:90%
on the Westport.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Highway, Highway 105, and it
was a very, very nice night,

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:90%
very nice, cold evening.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I approached the
Johns River delta area.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.770 align:middle line:90%
I had two cars in front of me.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I did not know who was
in them at that time,

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
but as we headed down the
hill into the delta area,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I could see a series
of lights in a row

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.460 align:middle line:84%
that were approaching
us, the group of cars,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
coming in from the
southwest over the hills.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And so.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:90%
It was very intriguing.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The big light in the
front was very bright.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And the lights in the back were
probably a quarter to a third

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
smaller, and they were
coming towards us.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And so unbeknownst
to me at that time,

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:84%
the two cars in front of
me also saw these lights,

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and we pulled over
simultaneously

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.730 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the road.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And we got out to
observe the lights.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed by
my car initially.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And the lady with the baby in
front of me stayed by her car.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the elderly couple
stayed by their car, too.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And we observed the lights.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And at some point in
time, we got together,

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.510 align:middle line:84%
standing next to the cars, to
talk about what we were seeing,

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out what
it is we were seeing.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And as we're standing there,
looking at the lights,

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the lights all got
together as a group,

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
much like a mother duck
rounding up her ducklings,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:90%
all around the big light.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking,
at the time,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I remember talking
about why did they stop,

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:90%
and what are they looking for.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:90%
It was like they had a mission.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And so we watched them there.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And they revolved-- and
revolved is kind of an odd word.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
They moved around the big light
in a very erratic motions.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:90%
It was at unusual angles.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And they moved around
this bright white light.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:90%
And they stayed.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
It was they were-- the
big light was motionless,

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and the smaller lights
all moved out and about,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.099 align:middle line:84%
not very far away
from the big light.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, at a
certain point there, I

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
would say the
whole thing went on

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of
minutes at least.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
They all paused, and then
individually, the smaller lights

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.820 align:middle line:84%
pulled away from the
major light at odd angles,

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and then literally shot north
and out over Grays Harbor.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the big light
followed at the end.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But they went at an
unbelievably high rate of speed.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:90%
There was no noise.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What great
testimony, Jim.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Exactly,
and he is completely

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:84%
consistent to this
day, because I

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:84%
spoke to him just three days
ago, prior to this program.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of
renewed a friendship.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And he also mentioned
in his report

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:84%
that he had seen a UFO prior to
this a long time ago, in 1968.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:90%
And he even told me what month.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, I reported it to
APRO In November of '68.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I called David Marler at the
National UFO Historical Records

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:10%
He looked it up for me while I
was communicating on the phone,

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:10%
and he found the
report right away.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:90%
And all of the details matched.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Allan Reymer is a completely
consistent, credible witness,

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and he never had a
problem being identified.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't care
if you use my name.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I know what I saw.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we have a still
based on what Allan saw.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.635 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:18:44.635 --> 00:18:47.177 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.177 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Exactly.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:90%
He drew that.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:84%
That's his diagram as
part of the MOFUN report

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
that I completed at the time
of the original investigation.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, Allan
also described

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:10%
what he saw, couldn't
have been made.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.855 align:middle line:10%
And then what
happens afterwards?

00:19:04.855 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Well, the way that
he described the objects leaving

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
the area, he said they moved
away faster than anything

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:90%
he has ever seen fly in the sky.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.135 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERVIEWER:
Have you ever seen

00:19:17.135 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
any kind of aircraft
or anything else

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:90%
in the air that moved like that.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.155 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLAN REYMER:
No, never. uh-uh.

00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:26.833 align:middle line:84%
And initially, we talked about
the fact, the four of us,

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:84%
of course, the
baby couldn't talk.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:84%
The four of us talked about,
could it be helicopters?

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we all
said, and we realize,

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:90%
we're not hearing any noise.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was a gorgeous
night, and so there

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.030 align:middle line:90%
was no wind of any kind.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:84%
There was, as far as I
know, it's a November night.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:90%
None of us had jackets on.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.955 align:middle line:84%
None of us recall
saying, boy, I'm chilly,

00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get back
in the car or anything.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.960 align:middle line:90%
So it was a very nice night.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I could
see a long distance

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.650 align:middle line:84%
as they were coming
towards us over the delta.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So we could see
them coming from--

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.060 align:middle line:84%
there was no distraction of any
kind as they came towards us.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, because the
smaller ones were maneuvering

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
in such erratic, almost
right-angled movements

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
from the main light, it was
not helicopter-type activity.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And then the rate at which they
departed from the delta area

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:90%
was almost like Star Wars.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way
they just shot off

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:90%
and they took off individually.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And they went, they
didn't follow each other.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:84%
They just took off
at weird angles

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:90%
to the northwest and northeast.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And there was no rhyme or
reason as they shot off.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the main
light basically

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:84%
went north and directly
out over the bay.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERVIEWER: What
happened afterwards?

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLAN REYMER: After
that, we talked.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember we're talking
about what did we see.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And we agreed, we didn't
know what we were looking at.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing I decided to do

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:84%
when I got back to Westport
was to call the police station

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and report it.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And the dispatcher there, I
remember this really clearly,

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:90%
saying this is bizarre.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:84%
We're getting so many calls that
just came in a few moments ago

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:90%
from the Grayland area.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So Grayland residents had
to have been reporting it

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
just before we did,
because I'm probably,

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
where I was from my car from
home, about 20 minutes away.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So the dispatcher
said, Wow, we're

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.880 align:middle line:84%
getting a lot of
calls about this,

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and took my name and number.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, I was
listening to my radio,

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember the
radio the primary radio

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:84%
station in 1979, but I do
remember the radio station

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:90%
reporting.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
We're getting our
calls about a lot

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
of lights coming in off the bay,
heading north over Grays Harbor.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERVIEWER: And did you ever
see any news coverage of this

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:90%
or hear any other stories?

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ALLAN REYMER: I remember
seeing one newspaper story

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:84%
that the McChord Air Force Base
was doing helicopter maneuvers

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:84%
or something over the
Grays Harbor area.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen lots and lots
of helicopters in my days.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And I've traveled
all over the world,

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and seen lots of different
kinds of helicopters.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:84%
This was not
helicopter-type maneuvers.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, what finally
happened to this case?

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Well, after I
went through Allan Raymer's

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:84%
testimony, and with the
other witnesses that I had,

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a short book about it.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:84%
I had a complete report,
and there was, to this day,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly what it
was, but I know what it wasn't.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't what
the County said.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:84%
The emergency service
director was pushing very hard

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that this was a helicopter
with a faulty exhaust manifold,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and somehow the oil
caught fire, et cetera.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I called commercial
helicopter pilots, and I said,

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:90%
this is what was seen.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:90%
This is what they're saying.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And they all laughed
at me at first.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:90%
They thought it was hysterical.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.380 align:middle line:84%
They said, you're not going
to catch the oil on fire.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:06.020 align:middle line:84%
It's designed not to catch fire
until like 600 degrees or so.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you started losing
any quantity of oil,

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:90%
you would crash.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, no helicopters
or aircraft were ever

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.775 align:middle line:84%
reported missing
from that night.

00:23:15.775 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
would have known that,

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Yes, there was an
official US Air Force search

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:90%
number placed on the incident.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was Scott
Air Force Base that

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
was in charge of coordinating
the search, the records.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's out
of Illinois, isn't it?

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: I believe so.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.455 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: But
they were doing--

00:23:35.455 --> 00:23:38.240 align:middle line:84%
they were assigning search
numbers for missing aircraft

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in the country.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many other
important UFO cases

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:90%
have you investigated?

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: During the time that
I was a member of MUFON for 30

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:90%
years, I would say around 2,000.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I occasionally
would pick up cases

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:84%
from the National UFO
Reporting Center referred

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:84%
by Peter Davenport, and
then miscellaneous cases

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.550 align:middle line:84%
that I've bumped into
where people would call me

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
because they knew
that I was someone

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:90%
who was intensely interested.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.885 align:middle line:84%
Now, this helicopter pilot, what
kind of experience did he have?

00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:14.385 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I believe
that one was--

00:24:14.385 --> 00:24:15.802 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
another case, right?

00:24:15.802 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I had
a career in 2012--

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I got that report from a man
in Castle Rock, Washington,

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:84%
who was a recently retired
career helicopter pilot,

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:90%
both military and commercial.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:90%
And he was deeply troubled.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:84%
One night he went into
town to pick up something

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:90%
at a drugstore.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Driving home, on the final
stretch before his house,

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
he looked up, and he saw
three swirling spheres

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.430 align:middle line:90%
that had very precise edges.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.170 align:middle line:90%
They were equidistant apart--

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: --and swirling
purple orange light.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Except that he
kept saying, like,

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
I've heard from other
witnesses, that there's

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:84%
something about this light
that isn't like anything else

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.430 align:middle line:90%
that he had ever seen.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:84%
He told me, he said, I've
never seen an aircraft that

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.350 align:middle line:90%
had a light like that on it.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:90%
And he was actually scared.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
He stopped in the
road because he

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.165 align:middle line:84%
was afraid to drive under
these three huge spheres.

00:25:19.165 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, there
was a federal agent

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:90%
who had an episode too, right?

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: That's
in July of 2014.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, you
remember all these dates.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.605 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I think that's why
Peter Davenport and I get along.

00:25:31.605 --> 00:25:33.682 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, he's
meticulous when it comes to--

00:25:33.682 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I try
to be meticulous.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.652 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not as much as him, but--

00:25:36.652 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what happened
with this federal agent?

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: He was on duty
in Vancouver, Washington,

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's the middle of
the day, perfect weather.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And with no warning, he sees
a classic disk-shaped flying

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:90%
saucer starred across the sky.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
He described how when it banked,
he could see the sunlight

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.540 align:middle line:90%
gleaming on it.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he said, I went
through the mental checklist.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.510 align:middle line:84%
No propellers, no jet
engines, no wings.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No sound.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: No sound.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then he tells me, he says,
but that's not the weird part.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I asked
him, what's the weird part.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:84%
He said it looked as if
someone drew a line in the air.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And as this saucer
crossed the line,

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't see it anymore.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it went
into another dimension.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Or it cloaked.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Take your pick.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or it cloaked.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Well,
because it was reported.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So soon after the
event, like within days.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I got the radar
data from the FAA.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine, a
NOAA-- former NOAA weatherman,

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.840 align:middle line:84%
unpacked the data,
put it on a map.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:84%
In the same area of the sky
where he saw the UFO disappear,

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
for two passes of
the radar, there

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.940 align:middle line:84%
was a solid object picked
up by the radar that

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:90%
had no transponder.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So that means if it was a
civilian aircraft or even

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:84%
a military aircraft,
it's completely illegal,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.500 align:middle line:84%
because they're near an
international airport

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:90%
and a big city.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.075 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot fly
without a transponder.

00:27:13.075 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they would
not have flown without one.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: No, they would not.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And then he's standing there
with his jaw hanging down

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:90%
thinking, what have I just seen?

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And here comes an
F-15 roaring out

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.450 align:middle line:84%
of the direction of the
Portland International Airport,

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
in the same direction
that the UFO went.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tracking it.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Apparently, because
we had-- its radar track

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:84%
was plainly visible
on the radar data.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There were some mill
workers on a fishing trip.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.540 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: This is one
of my favorite cases,

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
although it's
strictly anecdotal.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.820 align:middle line:84%
This gentleman was
a former millwright,

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.570 align:middle line:84%
which meant that he'd
done a career installing

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:90%
large machines in lumber mills.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:84%
He claimed that in umapine,
Oregon, one afternoon in 1983,

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:84%
he and his buddy are
walking along the road.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And all at once, there's
nobody else out there,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
the birds are singing, the
insects are clicking away.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And all at once, everything goes
absolutely flat, dead silent.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And while he's standing
there with his friend,

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.020 align:middle line:84%
they're thinking,
this is really odd,

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.400 align:middle line:90%
now the really odd part happens.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of huge vehicle,
device, something,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:34.160 align:middle line:84%
comes along just above the
roadway, right next to them,

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're afraid that they're
going to be run over by it.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: And the way he
likened this, though, he said,

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
imagine that you were standing
on a runway at a major airport

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and a 747 taxied
right next to you

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:84%
with the wing above you, the
huge tires, the big engines, all

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.440 align:middle line:84%
that, and you have to
step out of the way

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:84%
to keep from being
flattened by this.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Only you can't see it.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:84%
you know it's there,
because at the very edges

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.370 align:middle line:84%
there's kind of
a blurry outline.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you look straight
at it, you can't see it.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It has some kind of camouflage.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I see, that's all--

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.310 align:middle line:90%
the thing went on by them.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:90%
They weren't injured.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But they both
promised each other

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:84%
they would never talk about this
because it scared them to death.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.450 align:middle line:90%
It made absolutely no sense.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're completely
convinced that it was real.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, after
talking to him for a while,

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:90%
I think it was real, too.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Whatever happens,

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say, Jim,
after all these testimonies,

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.160 align:middle line:84%
you have to come
to some conclusion

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.412 align:middle line:90%
that these things are happening.

00:29:45.412 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: I think they are.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It's estimated there
is one high-quality UFO

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:84%
sighting somewhere in the world,
every hour of every single day

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
of what I would call a TRUFO,
a true UFO, where you have

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:04.150 align:middle line:84%
a high-quality witness combined
with a high strangeness event.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like disclosure
with these witnesses,

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:90%
telling all?

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I think
it helps them.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.620 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's also good.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that what I
provide because of my law

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:84%
enforcement background is, first
off, I know how to interview.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, if I
tell somebody I'm not

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.460 align:middle line:84%
going to divulge your name,
I don't divulge their name.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't break a confidence.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is your work
easier now that it

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:34.310 align:middle line:84%
seems like Congress is getting
a little closer to disclosure?

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Maybe.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.152 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or is it harder?

00:30:36.152 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Most of these
things cut both ways.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like two steps
forward, one step back.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:90%
There is more disclosure now.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.818 align:middle line:84%
They've admitted
that UAPs are real.

00:30:45.818 --> 00:30:47.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
know what they are--

00:30:47.485 --> 00:30:48.285 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Right.

00:30:48.285 --> 00:30:49.442 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --they say.

00:30:49.442 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Or
they're supposedly--

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.530 align:middle line:84%
if they get near
a military base,

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:90%
though, there are always drones.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:90%
They call them drones now.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't-- They don't say, oh,
we had a UAP over our top secret

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Oh, these are drones,
but they don't

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:84%
say who put the drones up
there or how big they were

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.908 align:middle line:90%
or what exactly they look like.

00:31:06.908 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a division
within the government that

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.060 align:middle line:84%
looks at this possibility
of disclosure?

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Oh, I
think there's always

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:90%
been a division in government.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I think there's been a form
of cold war going on ever

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.200 align:middle line:84%
since Roswell, and maybe
before, where we have

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:90%
factions within the government.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think it also happens
because over time people

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.570 align:middle line:84%
retire, new people
are hired, people

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
with different philosophies
or perspectives.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And so there's an
undercurrent of people

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:90%
who would like to disclose.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And there still is
a group, though,

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.480 align:middle line:84%
that wants to block
disclosure at all costs.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
UAP 1 compare to.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.870 align:middle line:90%
UAP 2.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Unidentified
aerial phenomena is UAP 1.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what we were
originally told

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:84%
was the new correct
parlance for UFO.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Then it became UAP 2, which
is unidentified anomalous

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.230 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And this has had a very
strange and a positive effect

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:90%
on me directly.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I am now in demand at
paranormal conferences, what

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.890 align:middle line:84%
used to be called
a ghost conference,

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:84%
they will now want a UFO
presenter in the mix.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.368 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it gives it that
scientific flavor, doesn't it?

00:32:22.368 --> 00:32:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes, it does.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:90%
But I think it also--

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.260 align:middle line:84%
what it provides for people
is what I think a lot of us

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.500 align:middle line:90%
suspect.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:84%
We may not have a total
explanation for what's going on,

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.610 align:middle line:90%
but it's not any one thing.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not nuts and bolts
UFO with little green men.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:84%
There's something more
that's almost a mental

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.710 align:middle line:84%
or a spiritual phenomenon
connected with this.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.030 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, the best
witnesses frequently

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.690 align:middle line:90%
turn out to be repeaters.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:54.490 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean by that?

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.093 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: They
will have experiences

00:32:57.093 --> 00:32:58.150 align:middle line:90%
throughout their life.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over and over.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.552 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: And then
there's the fact

00:33:02.552 --> 00:33:06.310 align:middle line:84%
that you can have five people
present for a UFO encounter,

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and three of them will tell
you that they didn't see it.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And the other two will
be adamant that they did.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they connected
to the paranormal?

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a higher form than us.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Further along the
evolutionary scale.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I always ask the question, well,
what would we be like in 10,000

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:32.300 align:middle line:84%
years or 100,000 years if we
don't destroy ourselves with

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.420 align:middle line:90%
overpopulation or whatever?

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are you
currently investigating, Jim?

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Well, currently
what I'm involved in right

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:84%
now is trying to
support something

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned briefly, which
is the National UFO Historical

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Records Center, That is being
worked on by David Marler

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.280 align:middle line:90%
in Rio Rancho.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm also working on a
case, a very famous case,

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:02.490 align:middle line:84%
involving a police officer,
a deputy sheriff in Portage

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:09.750 align:middle line:84%
County, Ohio, from April 17,
1966, who chased a UFO along

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:84%
with his partner and at
least two other officers.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.929 align:middle line:84%
There were hundreds
of civilian witnesses.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:20.130 align:middle line:84%
He chased a UFO
for over 80 miles.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:24.449 align:middle line:84%
And because of the way Blue Book
reacted and the media reacted

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:84%
and the public reacted, he
had a nervous breakdown,

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:30.280 align:middle line:90%
and his life was ruined.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Was never the same.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.989 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
witnessed a UAP/UFO?

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Oddly
enough, would have

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:90%
said no up until last November.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And this is a very funny story.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
But, as I'm sitting
here, it's real.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God's truth.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes, God's truth.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:90%
I was at a ghost conference.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I was in Port
Gamble, Washington.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It was a Saturday morning.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And I went into the men's
room on the ground floor

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.412 align:middle line:90%
of the old theater building.

00:35:02.412 --> 00:35:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You saw a
UFO in the men's room?

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: No, I saw a ghost.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what startles me.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could tell you
I saw an alien or a UFO.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:15.400 align:middle line:84%
But I was in a restroom
that was not very large.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.600 align:middle line:90%
There were, like, 3--

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.820 align:middle line:90%
2 urinals, a sink, and a toilet.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's all along one wall.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a window up high behind
my shoulder, sun coming through.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:84%
There is nobody else
in that room except me.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the ghost.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Well, that happens.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking care of myself.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And I can see my silhouette
very clearly outlined

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:84%
on the wall, a shadow,
my shadow, very precise.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And all at once,
with no warning,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.050 align:middle line:84%
a shadow of another
person, taller

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and broader shoulder
than me, walks up,

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and the shadow is
superimposed on mine.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.680 align:middle line:90%
And I am really startled.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I turn to the left.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I turn to the right.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.880 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody there.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: So I'm
thinking, I'm going

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:84%
to move this along
and get out of here.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm washing my hands.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is the really odd part.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:84%
I guess many cases, encounters
have an objective part

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.180 align:middle line:90%
and a subjective part.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe that I heard
a voice in my head.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.220 align:middle line:90%
It was not my voice.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't know whose voice it was.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I heard a male voice
very calmly say, brother,

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.820 align:middle line:90%
you are welcome here.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the men's room.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: In the men's room.

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:37.940 align:middle line:90%
I know, it sounds crazy.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.670 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I
thought, well, thanks.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm out of there.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I went upstairs,
and I told the man

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:84%
in charge of the conference
what had happened.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, by the
way, Port Gamble

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.480 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be
the most haunted

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.340 align:middle line:90%
city in Washington State.

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.360 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting place.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I told him about
it, and he said,

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.790 align:middle line:84%
you're not the
first person who had

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.390 align:middle line:90%
a sighting in the men's room.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, it's
always the men's room

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:06.990 align:middle line:90%
and not the women's room.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's the
same ghost, probably.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.918 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Apparently.

00:37:09.918 --> 00:37:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of weeks
later, he does ghost tours.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.210 align:middle line:90%
He told my story.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the people on
the tour, this one man,

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:20.558 align:middle line:90%
started looking pale and upset.

00:37:20.558 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Happened to him.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yep.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.550 align:middle line:90%
He'd just been in there.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:27.260 align:middle line:84%
He saw a full form
figure that scared him.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And he got out of
there really quick.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
to make of this.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.250 align:middle line:90%
This is a new world for me.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're the
first person I've ever

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:84%
heard tell a story about
a ghost in a bathroom.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.067 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Yeah,
I'm not surprised.

00:37:40.067 --> 00:37:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you think
all this is going to take us

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.710 align:middle line:90%
in the next 5 or 10 years.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.810 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARKSON: Well, I'm
always dreaming for a day

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:50.740 align:middle line:10%
that we broaden our
consciousness to the point

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:55.470 align:middle line:10%
that we become the Terrans,
the people of Earth,

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.940 align:middle line:10%
that noisy, squabbling,
unpredictable group

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.300 align:middle line:10%
of human beings.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And we quit fighting each other.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.250 align:middle line:90%
That's what my hope for is.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.210 align:middle line:10%
I don't know that
that's going to happen,

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:10.580 align:middle line:10%
but I believe that studying
this, embracing this mystery,

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:10%
is part of how we get there.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we getting to
the answers we want, Jim?

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: I think we are.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm praying that we are.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.340 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
that we keep the faith

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.110 align:middle line:90%
and keep being positive.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going
to keep investigating?

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: I'll keep
investigating till I take

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.500 align:middle line:90%
the ultimate investigation.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of all the cases you've
been investigating, all of them,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.467 align:middle line:84%
which one stands out
the most for you?

00:38:38.467 --> 00:38:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: A couple of the ones
that we've talked about here.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But the one that meant the
most to me was June Crain.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:90%
And the reason is, although--

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
well, actually, she did
have a UFO sighting in 1975

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.830 align:middle line:84%
that I did not include
in the book originally,

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.035 align:middle line:90%
because I just wasn't sure.

00:38:55.035 --> 00:38:55.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:55.835 --> 00:38:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: But it was a
structured vehicle, again,

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.440 align:middle line:90%
over the Columbia River.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Only she was on
the Portland side.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it is
about Portland and Vancouver,

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:84%
but I've had a whole bunch
of remarkable reports.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But June is the most
important one to me,

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.960 align:middle line:84%
because I got a
picture of her life.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Even if she had
never mentioned UFOs,

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:21.080 align:middle line:90%
I got to hear about history.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part that
I love in all of this.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:84%
About the Air
Force in its birth,

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:30.260 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I also heard her
story, because she

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.400 align:middle line:84%
was a professional
woman who was very

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.362 align:middle line:84%
proud of her work for the
United States Government.

00:39:39.362 --> 00:39:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you believe her?

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: Yes.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.110 align:middle line:90%
And she gave me her papers.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.440 align:middle line:90%
She was consistent.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.940 align:middle line:90%
I believe she was truthful.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But she also was a woman who
was torn by her situation.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:90%
She got married.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:54.820 align:middle line:90%
They had a son.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:00.280 align:middle line:84%
The husband, he was one of the
security police at the base.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
leave the military,

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted her
to go with him.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And June had to leave a
job that she dearly loved.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And then a few years later, he
was killed in a strange traffic

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:16.110 align:middle line:84%
accident in Portland,
which I verified

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.720 align:middle line:90%
through newspaper clippings.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange indeed.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:20.995 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARKSON: It was strange.

00:40:20.995 --> 00:40:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And she looked
back over her life.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARKSON: Thank you very
much for this opportunity.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.010 align:middle line:90%
It means a lot.

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The story of June
Crain is absolutely incredible.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.790 align:middle line:90%
And Jim has put it into a book.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Get it, because it'll tell you
a story that is unbelievable.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.490 align:middle line:90%
