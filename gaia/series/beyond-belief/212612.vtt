00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:10%
Jason James Bickford with us,
an independent media producer,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:10%
visual artist, and
Gnostic educator.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Jason, welcome to the program.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.155 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON BICKFORD: Thanks
for having me back George.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.743 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
Gnostic educator?

00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: Well, I
like to teach people

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:10%
about Gnosis, which
is a Greek word that

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:10%
refers to a spiritual
type of knowledge.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:10%
And the Gnostics were
actually the early Christians

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:10%
of the first and second
century and spread out

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:10%
from there, kind of
underground and in conflict

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:10%
with the mainstream
Roman Church of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:10%
the third and fourth century.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.932 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they good people?

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you hear these
rumors that Gnosticism

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:90%
is this and that.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:90%
What kind of people were they?

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well,
I would mention

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:84%
that the term "Gnosticism"
has been almost

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:84%
universally
announced by academia

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:90%
to be a bit problematic.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's a creation of
18th century academics

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to describe something
that we only

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:90%
knew about from the polemics.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the only thing
we knew about the Gnostics,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
up until the discovery
of the Nag Hammadi,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
was just a few fragments and
then, everything the Roman

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Church wrote, and that
was their main enemy.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So we, well, nowadays,
if I said, would you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:84%
like to learn about
this political party,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to give you
the information coming

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:90%
from their opponents?

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.665 align:middle line:84%
You're obviously going to get
something of a biased take, so.

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And tainted.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Yeah.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does it
mean to be a Gnostic?

00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, the
Gnostic Christians

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.990 align:middle line:84%
had one main difference between
the other early Christians,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's what's called
the demiurgical position.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And this comes from the
word "demiurgos," which

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:90%
comes out of middle Platonism.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Plato had proposed an idea
that this flawed world was

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:84%
a creation of an
intelligent designer,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
but that intelligent
designer was not the,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
let's say, the most high
or ineffable creator

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:90%
of the Christians.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.207 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
Gnostics today?

00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I believe
there are people

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:84%
who are following something of
a spiritual libertarianism that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is not entirely
unlike a Gnostic path.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
But they aren't necessarily
identifying themselves

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:90%
as Christians.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:84%
My goal, as a Christian
messenger and a Christian

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Gnostic, is to kind of unify
some disparate mythologies

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and patterns so that we can kind
of illuminate a spiritual path

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.850 align:middle line:84%
that I think was
lost for a while.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we're starting
to piece it back together.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, what does a
Gnostic Christian believe?

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Aside from the main
position that the Old Testament

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
creator God is the product
of a group of people

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
who were inspired
spiritually but also

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
motivated politically and also
corrupt, as all humans can be.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And so the Jewish law was
seen by the Gnostic Christians

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:84%
as being partially the product
of a spiritual enlightenment

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
but also something
that was corrupt.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Jewish God, the
creator God of Yahweh,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:84%
was a lesser god,
something of a mediator

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
or a regional bureaucrat
over this world but not

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.905 align:middle line:84%
the ineffable
source of creation.

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
the stills you created

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:90%
on the concept of Gnosis.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: We have some ideas
here that I've illustrated

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:90%
about what Gnosis is and isn't.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.975 align:middle line:84%
And I made some
illustrations about that.

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, well, let's
take a look at these

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and have you explain
what they are--

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and you created all
of these, right?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Yeah, I have
a background in visual art

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:90%
as well as English literature.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I try to put words and pictures
together the best I can.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a statement
from the Book of Revelations,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
which was traditionally known
as the Book of Apocalypse.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're told about the
cyclical nature of time

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and that we are going
to enter in what's

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.010 align:middle line:84%
called the days of Noah and in
the days of the trumpet call,

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to be sounded by the seventh
angel, the mystery of God

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
would be fulfilled,
just as he announced

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:90%
to his servants, the prophets.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm thinking of the
President Trump elected

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
seven years ago and seven
trumpets and different patterns

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
within society approaching
the days of Noah.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that lends itself
to the acronym, the D-O-N,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
or the Don, which
is interesting.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of Gnosis being
something of a mystery

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.300 align:middle line:90%
that is ineffable and infinite.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I have here
is a series of,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
let's say, we could refer to
the idea Shakespeare made famous

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:90%
that the world is a stage.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have a spiritual
intimation, as we do here,

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:84%
someone offers you
a peek backstage.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And so that's an initiation
or a disclosure of a mystery.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you pull that
curtain back and go backstage,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostic finds that
there's yet another curtain.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And so you're offered,
would you like to see more?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you go down a few
stages, and at some point,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
you get the creepy feeling
that there is absolutely

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:90%
no end to this.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.985 align:middle line:84%
And so the ineffable
creator or source

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
of all that the Christians
choose to call God essentially

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:84%
would be giving the Gnostic
the notion here that we

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:90%
can do this all day, right?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:90%
You can't know what God knows.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:90%
There is no ultimate mystery.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I have here is
an image of the human eye

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and then a classic image
of the Jewish conception

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth as a self-contained
domed-over unit that I believe

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
resembles both the human eye
and symbolically the human body.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And so when we view
the Earth as something

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
of a pattern of creation,
through which, literally,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:84%
we are eyes and ears for
the creator on the ground.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the way we
perceive the world,

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.650 align:middle line:84%
the creator
perceives through us.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:84%
When we approach this mystery,
we come to the realization

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
that this world has a designer
and has an intelligent design

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
to it and that we
can never, ever

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:90%
know that ineffable mystery.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's a bit of a
blessing and a curse

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:84%
in that Gnosis can be
the revealing that there

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
is this infinite regression
but that you'll never know it.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So the knowledge is that
there is knowledge to be known

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:84%
but that ultimately,
this is something

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that, in this lifetime,
we don't know.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are we
looking at here, Jace?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Ultimately,
this search for knowledge

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:84%
can become something
of a narcissism trap.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:10%
You can get kind of stuck in
your own proverbial rabbit

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:10%
hole, so to speak.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:10%
So I've used an
image of myself here,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:10%
traveling through
what could be seen

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:10%
as that infinite regression
of the curtain pulls,

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:10%
looking for more and more.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And the deeper you
go into this mystery,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:84%
the more you get
untethered from reality,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and you become kind of, well,
I'm reminded of a scene--

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Detached?

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I'm reminded of a
scene in a famous novel that

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:84%
perfectly embeds
this, and it's where

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:90%
I got some of this information.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:84%
The novel "Infinite Jest,"
by David Foster Wallace,

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:84%
features this prank where
people go into a theater.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the curtains
are pulled back,

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and there's cameras
aimed at the audience.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And then what's projected onto
the screen is just the audience

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:90%
watching themselves.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's a piece
of performance art.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.732 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the
audience becomes disturbed

00:07:41.732 --> 00:07:42.690 align:middle line:90%
and leaves the theater.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what
was the significance

00:07:44.273 --> 00:07:45.930 align:middle line:90%
of the eyes in the camera?

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: So the eye would
be that ineffable source

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
that when you walk
into this mystery,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
you encounter something
of a creative force.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
eye symbolically

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
represents something
that is observing us

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.985 align:middle line:84%
but also, symbolically,
the eye is the I am.

00:08:03.985 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: So I use that
as an esoteric symbol

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:90%
for an ineffable source.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I try not to define
what God is but point

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to the reality
that aspects of God

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
can be encountered
through Gnosis.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is what is
called co-creative faculty?

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: So the
co-creative faculty

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.690 align:middle line:84%
is something that I believe is
enabled through what I would

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
call divine personal
sovereignty, in that there's

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:84%
a classic idea that we are made
in the image of the creator.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that quantum
physics has already shown us

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:84%
that to a degree, the observer
influences the experiment

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:90%
on a quantum level.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
But I believe there's
also, I believe

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
in something of a Gnostic
kind of a spiritual quantum

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
effect, in which there's
like a spiritual double-slit

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:84%
experiment, in which we are
eyes and ears on the ground

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:84%
for a creative force that
is generating this world out

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we're collaborating
with a substrate consciousness,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and the way we view the
world impacts the way

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that we co-create
it, collectively.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, you have
a precognitive ability,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.126 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:09:16.126 --> 00:09:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I've come
to understand this

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
through actually kind of
decoding my own visual art.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about some of
my decoding of visual art

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:90%
when I was here last time.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.937 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:09:28.937 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: And it turns out
that my first appearance here

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:90%
was actually a bit precognitive.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did some
of them come true?

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I
produced a short video

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.580 align:middle line:84%
about how I seem to have
precognitively pointed

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:84%
towards the Marshall
fires in Colorado,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
just a few months before
they happened while we

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.000 align:middle line:90%
spoke to each other last time.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.247 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
take a look at this.

00:09:50.247 --> 00:09:52.330 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD (VOICEOVER):
During my first appearance

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:10%
on "Beyond Belief,"
filmed September 2021,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:10%
I spoke with George about
symbolism and Renaissance art

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:10%
that points to,
among other things,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:10%
the year 2021 and an
SOS with Smokey the Bear

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:10%
as well as imagery of an
Antichrist spirit passing

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:10%
through and tempting people
to spread the bad news

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.513 align:middle line:10%
and hate the neighbor.

00:10:11.513 --> 00:10:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
we need to let go.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what that
symbolism shows.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a bad breath encoded
in the "Salvator Mundi."

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we open up the third
eye of Mona Lisa, she's crying.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:10%
And we have "Drain the Swamp
Thing," symbolism in Goya

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.820 align:middle line:10%
and Swamp Thing is
a master builder,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:10%
stirring up the swamp to drain
it of the flammable methane.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:10%
This overlays method
of decoding led

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:10%
me to speculate
about a bad breath

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:10%
or spirit of the
age, lightning tears,

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:10%
swamps drained of
flammable methane,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:10%
and a warning of fires in 2021.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:10%
And at the very
end of the year, I

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:10%
watched the Marshall fires,
Colorado's most destructive

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:10%
fires in history
from my backyard,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:10%
down the street
from Gaia studios,

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:10%
where I was creating a
work of art in my studio,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:10%
involving a warning
of danger of fire.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:10%
And there is an angel
saving someone from fire

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:10%
and bringing them into a kind
of a safe place of holy water

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:10%
and a new platform.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm co-creating a new platform
of grass here for myself.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
That was my intention
with this work.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.030 align:middle line:10%
And that synced up with
two months straight of rain

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:10%
this past summer, which gave
Colorado more rain than it

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.880 align:middle line:10%
had seen in over 150 years.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's how esoteric
precognitive symbolism

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:84%
works in Renaissance
art as well as my own.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm impressed,
Jason, with your knowledge

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:90%
and your ability.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.073 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Thank you.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I was a visual artist
most of my life.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.290 align:middle line:90%
I just never let it go.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that most of us have
a co-creative faculty that's

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
very, very powerful
in childhood,

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and the patterns
and rhythms that we

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:84%
follow going into
adult life often

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.372 align:middle line:84%
diminish that
co-creative faculty.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you make
these predictions,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.065 align:middle line:90%
how did they come to you?

00:11:50.065 --> 00:11:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: You
know, sometimes I

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.320 align:middle line:84%
make predictions that
are really rooted

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
in a logical and analytical
look at the world,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
where I take a look at
archetypal mythopoetic

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.980 align:middle line:84%
symbolism that is
embedded in pop culture.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it, many things

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:84%
are creative that we may
not realize are creative.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm suggesting that
the human ability for--

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
the human creative
imagination is, itself,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
a kind of magical
truth-bearing faculty.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever someone
is using their creation,

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
they can tap into this
ability that I believe taps

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:84%
into a substrate
consciousness, or the Vedics

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
would say maybe you're listening
to the Akashic Records.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The Jews and
Christians might say

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:90%
you've looked at God's book.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So this idea of dipping into an
underworld or sometimes people

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
use higher mind, but I think
the direction doesn't matter.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Getting outside of oneself
and looking at something

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.830 align:middle line:84%
from a bigger picture allows
us to actually communicate

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
with something that I believe
artists and creative types,

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:84%
in general, are
kind of tapped into.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's an intuitive
translation of something

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
that arrives to the mind in
the form of vague symbolism.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And so people have
a different way

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.472 align:middle line:90%
of describing the specifics.

00:13:16.472 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And they say, the
devil's in the details.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I try to keep it vague, but I
have my own very specific ideas

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:90%
about what's going on.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking of the devil,
in the Book of Revelation,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.530 align:middle line:90%
they talk about 666.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: We dipped into
this very briefly last time,

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm absolutely
fascinated the more I

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.938 align:middle line:90%
uncover this information.

00:13:36.938 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's incredible.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: We are
living in a time

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're told is significantly
impacted by humanity's

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:90%
use of carbon and fossil fuels.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the carbon
atom is what we're referring to

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:90%
in the number 666.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:84%
We've got a saying in
the Book of Apocalypse,

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:84%
or the Book of
Revelation, which doesn't

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:84%
mean the book of the
end of the world.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:84%
It means the book of an
unveiling or an uncovering.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And the book of the
uncovering tells us

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that someone who has
wisdom, or sophia,

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.600 align:middle line:84%
is going to be able to
decipher the number of the man

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:90%
in the beast that is 666.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
This is clearly a
reference to the building

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
block for all organic
life on Earth,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:90%
which is carbon-based life.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And stable carbon,
which we are made of,

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.470 align:middle line:84%
it has 6 protons, 6
neutrons, and 6 electrons.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So we see here the inspired
creative imagination

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
that I believe is cooperating
in the form of John

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:84%
the Divine, who wrote this book
1,600, 1,700, 1,800 years ago.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the ability
for the creative imagination

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to tap into these
substrate patterns

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.660 align:middle line:84%
allows for a man
or a woman to write

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:90%
something that's inspired.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And then it means something for
them in their time and place.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.490 align:middle line:84%
But the patterns and
evolution of our consciousness

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and the way that we
relate to that language

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
is guided by something
that is ineffable.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And now, in modern times, we
understand that 666 is carbon,

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and the carbon crisis has to
do with these old patterns.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at a still
that echoes exactly what you've

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:90%
been talking about.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: So in
this illustration,

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
we see, on the left,
a classic Jewish idea

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
of the structure of the Earth
as a self-contained domed-over

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.400 align:middle line:90%
unit.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to be clear that
I'm not suggesting that this

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:90%
is what the Earth looks like.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm suggesting that the
intellectual and imaginative

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
constructs that we use
to understand the world

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and have used to understand
the world, classically,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and the construct that
was used by the Jews,

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.150 align:middle line:84%
who wrote the
inspired scripture,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, something of
a truth-bearing pattern.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So even if this isn't literally
true, the pattern of it

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And we see, in the Earth,
something of this idea

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
underworld or a Sheol.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a Greek
system, there would

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
be something of a bifurcated
kind of gumball, in which you

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:90%
have a flat Earth with a dome.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you spin it upside
down, and there's another one,

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and then you put
those two together,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:90%
and you've got a sphere.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that sphere, you
have the land of the living

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and then the land of the dead.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.690 align:middle line:10%
Sheol in the Jewish sense,
is the same as Hades,

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.400 align:middle line:10%
in the Greek sense,
in that it is

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:10%
the world where the dead go to.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So when we are
breathing in, we are

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:84%
taking in a breath or
spirit from another world

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and that gets incorporated
into biological organisms here.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are patterns
in human creativity

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:84%
that reflect this structure
of the carbon atom.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:84%
We can take a look at the
intake manifold in a combustion

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
engine, and that's
what separates

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and times the
delivery of the oxygen

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:84%
into that fuel injection
system so that you can

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:90%
feed the fire in the engine.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's not entirely
unlike intaking

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
the manifoldness of the
wisdom of God in the spirit.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is reflected
in Ephesians 3:10,

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:84%
in which Saint Paul says that
now is the time in which we are

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.650 align:middle line:84%
going to make known to
the archons, the rulers,

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:90%
the manifoldness.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Now I believe this
manifoldness is something

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:84%
of a mathematical term, in which
we have a fractal-like nature

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:90%
to the structure of reality.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at our next picture.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: And so
what I've suggested

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:10%
here is that this traversing
of one world to another

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:10%
is the mythopoetic
pattern of Jesus and Noah

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.910 align:middle line:10%
and several other
figures in mythology.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:10%
And this type of story is
still being told nowadays

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:10%
in pop culture media.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just something
that happened 2,000 years ago.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it believed?

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, George,
the creative imagination

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:90%
keeps telling this story.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:06.773 align:middle line:10%
So on some level--

00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Over and over again

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: --it is
important to us, even

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:10%
to the people that created it.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And think of it as a fiction.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:10%
I believe myth is
streamlined truth.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:10%
So myth can be
fiction and truth.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:10%
So the Christians
call this event

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:10%
when Christ is crucified
"the harrowing of hell,"

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:10%
and the HOH is a symbol of that
water molecule, or the H2O.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:10%
And so we have this
mythopoetic pattern

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:10%
of a world coming to an end
and a dry world getting a flood

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:10%
and then another
world getting a fire.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And so Noah arriving in an
ark is the harrowing of hell,

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:90%
or the H2O, event.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's
actually the symbol of Jesus.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this all maps on
to the UAP and UFO phenomenon.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Einstein would
be impressed with you.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Maybe, yeah.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I do
have a syncretic mind

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that does try to take a
look at the spiritual side.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, I regret
that Alfred Wallace,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
the founder of the
theory of adaptation,

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
from whom Darwin got his basis
for evolution, if only-- he

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
acknowledged intelligent design,
but he wasn't a Christian

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.880 align:middle line:90%
and didn't read scripture.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:84%
He was adamant that
the world was designed

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:84%
by an intelligence
that specifically

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:90%
had carbon-based life in mind.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And so if we think of this
world as Hades or Sheol

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
or the Underworld
from a classic sense,

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
this world isn't hell but
a spiritual way station,

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:84%
in which everybody goes
and then waits for an event

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that we know through
the story of Noah

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.740 align:middle line:84%
as well as through
UAP phenomena.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You made
another video showing

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
particle physics

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus, which is
truly remarkable.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD (VOICEOVER):
The birth of Jesus

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:90%
was an extraterrestrial event.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Jesus can
be seen as a visitor

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:10%
from another world
who came bearing

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:10%
a message about the
immortality of the soul

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:10%
and the existence
of a spiritual realm

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:10%
we come from and return to.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
The equilateral triangle, with
its three equal internal angles

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:84%
of 60 degrees and the stable
carbon atom, the number of man

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and beast, of Revelations,
with its 6 protons, 6 neutrons,

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and 6 electrons, embeds that
vulva, birth canal shape.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.230 align:middle line:10%
And the breaking of the water
or the breaking of the seal

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:10%
and the birth of a
new world or paradigm

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:10%
is embedded here in the
symbol of the Illuminati.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.585 align:middle line:10%
The word "Lucifer" doesn't
appear in the Bible but Morning

00:20:33.585 --> 00:20:36.330 align:middle line:10%
Star, Light Bringer,
and Venus symbolism

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:10%
is attached to Jesus, the light
and the way, AKA the L.A.W.,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:10%
which is written in your heart.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:10%
If you go too far down into that
theater of the world looking

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:10%
for the Illuminati
or the dark secrets,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:10%
you could get lost in
your own rabbit hole,

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:10%
and that's going
around in circles.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:10%
That cyclical loop of the
dozen is embedded in the word

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:10%
"dozen," the 12 hours
of the clock, who don't

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:10%
have enough space to do Zen.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have enough
room to get lost so

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.175 align:middle line:90%
that they could be found again.

00:21:03.175 --> 00:21:04.550 align:middle line:10%
You can do that
in your own mind,

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:10%
but some people
are more material

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:10%
and need to go into the world
and dig down into Sheol,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:10%
into the bowels and guts of the
Earth to go through the bowels.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:10%
But if you go too far,
that's the same thing

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:10%
as going into that
cellar staircase, right?

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you try to dig
into the mind of God.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:90%
That's false Gnosis.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It can't happen, and
it's for mad men only.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was Jesus a Gnostic?

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Absolutely,
and it's in the scripture.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to appeal
to some Gnostic book

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.000 align:middle line:84%
that they dug up in a
cave a few years ago.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:84%
It's been in the
Bible the whole time

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's pretty
controversial, isn't it?

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: It's becoming
less and less controversial.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
mainstream Christian churches,

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
with all their scandal
and ridiculousness,

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:84%
are actually doing me
a favor, as a Gnostic.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talk about your Gnostic
quotes from Paul and Jesus.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Explain them.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: So I have
prepared a few images that

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:84%
have some key quotes
from Saint Paul,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
the first Christian writer,
and Jesus, himself, that

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:90%
are quite indubitably Gnostic.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
let's look at these.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: So in
this first statement,

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
from Saint Paul in 1
Corinthians 2: 6 through 7,

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:16.773 align:middle line:84%
he states "we do speak wisdom,"
and that is sophia, in Greek,

00:22:16.773 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:90%
the word for "wisdom."

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:84%
"We do speak sophia among
the initiates but not

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:25.490 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of this age or of the
archons or rulers of this age

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:90%
who are passing away.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But we speak the
hidden sophia of God

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:84%
in a mystery, which God ordained
before the aeons of our glory."

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So that is a statement
that suggests

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
cyclical unveiling

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:45.342 align:middle line:84%
and that it is absolutely
intended and repeats itself.

00:22:45.342 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
look at the next one.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: Here, we
have 2 Corinthians 4.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:10%
"As we look not
to the things that

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:10%
are seen but to the
things that are unseen.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:10%
For the things that
are seen are transient,

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:10%
but the things that are
unseen are eternal."

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:10%
So Saint Paul is
pointing to this idea

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.630 align:middle line:10%
that I believe maps onto Gnostic
idealism, in that essentially,

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:10%
that everything that
we see is something

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:10%
of a co-creative figment of
an imagination of which we

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:10%
participate in but don't
completely know or understand.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And our next still.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: And here we have an
incredibly Gnostic statement,

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'm using a detail from the
"Garden of Earthly Delights"

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:90%
by Hieronymus Bosch.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'll point out that looks
a lot like the Tic Tac UAPs.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And here, in 1 Corinthians
1:30, Saint Paul

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
tells us "because of him,
you are in Christ Jesus,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.960 align:middle line:90%
who became sophia from God."

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.780 align:middle line:84%
That is a fascinating
statement in which

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.790 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostic understanding
of a feminine divine essence

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:84%
is actually equated with
being Jesus in spirit form.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well looked at.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a clip of Jesus
connected to UFOs in paintings

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:90%
from the Middle Ages.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:57.748 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Absolutely.

00:23:57.748 --> 00:24:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about this
after we look at the video.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.262 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD (VOICEOVER):
I'd like to introduce you

00:24:02.262 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:84%
to UAP, Jesus, the greatest
Easter egg of all time.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:10%
And in this
hypothesis, Christ is

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:10%
something of a central hero
in a scrambled myth located

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:10%
throughout World mythology
and entertainment,

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.890 align:middle line:10%
in which the Christ is broken
or the crust is broken.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And then things from one
world travel into another.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Christ became
sophia, and sophia is

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:26.370 align:middle line:84%
code for "song of fire and
ice" or "fire in the air,"

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
it depends on which
world you're in.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:84%
If you see the sophia
as in sofa and I,

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:84%
then you might be
in the world where

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:90%
you don't take as much action.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:10%
So this might be
something of a cover up,

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:10%
and as we have an
unveiling, things

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:10%
are getting a little
hot in here, I believe.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:10%
And so that cultural
climate change

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:10%
has to do with information,
and that information

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:10%
might have something to do with
the harrowing of hell event

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.900 align:middle line:10%
that was 9/11, in which I
believe Noah and Jesus kind

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:10%
of symbolically show up in
an ark that's a UFO, a UAP.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:84%
The harrowing of hell embeds
that HOH, and that's water.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle line:84%
We see in the "Salvator
Mundi," Christ

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
is bringing water
into the world.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:10%
That's a reference to
Lazarus and the rich man.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:84%
When Christ is stepping
on it, putting the pedal

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.130 align:middle line:84%
to the metal in that
symbolism, in which he

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.990 align:middle line:84%
appears to be a projection
coming out of a, UAP Tic Tac.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Tic Tacs
give you fresh breath

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:90%
and a spirit of bad breath.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And in John 20:22, Christ
breathes out a new spirit.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are authentic.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:90%
That's truly remarkable.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.547 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, it looks like
a craft of some type.

00:25:32.547 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Yeah, those
murals, some of them

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
are being covered up in the
churches out in Eastern Europe.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, the
whole world has been

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:84%
looking at that Christian
art for hundreds of years,

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and I would suggest that because
of the co-creative faculty,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.590 align:middle line:84%
the Christian art can be
inspired in the same way

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.470 align:middle line:84%
that the scripture can and
that we can take a look at it

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:90%
with modern eyes.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And we can understand that
there's symbolism there

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.653 align:middle line:84%
for us now that they wouldn't
have known of back then.

00:25:55.653 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What else could
that have been, other

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:90%
than an extraterrestrial craft?

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: And think
about the event.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Easter.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Now we have created a modern
culture with Easter eggs

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and this holiday of Easter that
doesn't seem to have anything

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.580 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever to do with
the Christian holiday

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and actually seems
to be more in line

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:90%
with pagan fertility religions.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And I can't help but think
of Moses being shipped down

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:84%
the river Nile in that
basket, and this creature.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's Noah's Ark.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Moses in the basket, Noah's Ark.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:90%
And now think about this.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.040 align:middle line:84%
We all just went
through a quarantine,

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and that's a word
that comes to us

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:84%
from the Italian "quarantena,"
which means 40 days.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And in Jewish
scripture, Moses goes up

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.620 align:middle line:90%
on the mountain for 40 days.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Noah goes in the
ark for 40 days.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the New Testament,
Jesus, after his baptism,

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:84%
goes into the desert of
the real for 40 days,

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.820 align:middle line:90%
and he is tempted by the devil.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe this
spirit of the age

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about, with
that carbon crisis and the 666,

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:84%
maps onto this idea
that there's something

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
of a spirit of temptation that
people are wrestling with,

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the flood
of Noah actually occurred?

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: There does seem
to be a geological record

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
for a massive flood,
and there seems

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.990 align:middle line:84%
to be mythological records of
this flood story in some form

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.970 align:middle line:90%
or another all over the planet.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that that
flood is not just Noah

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.460 align:middle line:90%
but it is the Easter event.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the Easter
egg or what Jesus

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
did after he was crucified
before he was resurrected

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:84%
has been the subject
of speculation.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And the Catholics call that
the harrowing of hell, which

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.635 align:middle line:84%
I take to be hydrogen,
oxygen, and hydrogen.

00:27:42.635 --> 00:27:46.130 align:middle line:84%
It's literally the
co-creative faculty

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.730 align:middle line:84%
of the human imagination that
inspired the Catholics to call

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that the harrowing of hell
and then for everybody,

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.950 align:middle line:84%
for centuries, to agree that
that's what that story is

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
called is there because
the spirit that inspired

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.120 align:middle line:84%
it wanted that pattern of HOH
to be there, and it's the water.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And here we have
you, Jason, breaking down

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.357 align:middle line:84%
the Great Seal on the
back of a dollar bill.

00:28:07.357 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: The story is on
the back of the dollar bill.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
look at the significance.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.032 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD (VOICEOVER): There
has been much speculation

00:28:13.032 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:10%
about the esoteric
symbolism behind the Great

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:10%
Seal of the United States
on the dollar bill.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:10%
What I haven't heard
of before, yet,

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.290 align:middle line:10%
is the symbolism for the
two orders of creation,

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:10%
the Cult of Isis and the story
of Noah, Jonah, and Jesus

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:10%
embedded in this monomyth.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:10%
There can be only one, possibly.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:10%
Regeneration in the
covenant of Isis

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:10%
is embedded here in the
overlapping circles.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you in just a
second how that vesica piscis

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:84%
mandorla shape of the almond
in overlapping circles

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:84%
embeds not just
two orders of time

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and two worlds coming
together but also something

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
of a pictographic mystery
in which we see the letter

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
O, which is the 15th letter
representing pictographically

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:05.070 align:middle line:84%
not just 15, but the word
"is" or the letters "I S."

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:09.840 align:middle line:10%
So we have 15 and 15, equaling
30, and that is triple X.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:10%
And that is a symbol for
moonshine or carnal knowledge

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.410 align:middle line:10%
or not-safe-for-work stuff.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.750 align:middle line:10%
And it only takes 14 days to
flatten that curve of the moon,

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:10%
but we have 30 embedded in the
triple X of Isis, or 15 and 15.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is one too far in
that infinite regression

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.680 align:middle line:84%
of the basement, going to
see some, well, something

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.942 align:middle line:90%
you haven't seen before.

00:29:33.942 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's the mystery.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's the heavenly
bodies you were promised

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
or some other one more secret
behind one more curtain reveal.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a Cult
of Isis warning here,

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:90%
embedded in the money.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a tool, but you can
also take it too far.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long did it take
you, Jason, to decipher what

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.590 align:middle line:90%
we've been looking at tonight?

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because it's almost
like genius material.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: The
word "genius" has

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.150 align:middle line:84%
undergone a bit of
a transformation

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:06.590 align:middle line:90%
over the past century.

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Typically, before
the 20th century,

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:84%
we associated the word "genius"
to mean an attendant spirit

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and not an actual person.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, if someone
invents something

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:84%
or they create this
beautiful work of art,

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:90%
we say that person is a genius.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But traditionally,
the word "genius"

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
comes to us from the
same word we get the word

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:90%
"jinn" in the Muslim tradition.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's something of a spirit
in a bottle that's let out

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:90%
and interacts with human.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.350 align:middle line:90%
So the human is not a genius.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So I appreciate and I
am flattered, George,

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
but I would say that no
human being is a genius.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.915 align:middle line:84%
But human beings can participate
and interact with genius.

00:30:45.915 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
pretty darn good.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: To
answer your question,

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I was a self-identified
atheist, and then I

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:84%
was struggling
with an alcoholism.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know where to go.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:middle line:90%
In my late 20s.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.662 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had all
the answers, and they

00:31:02.662 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:90%
didn't get me where I wanted.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I had the epiphany
that, hey, maybe I'm

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:84%
not just an innocent victim of
circumstance but it's my fault.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I underwent a
psychedelic therapy

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
address my alcoholism.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual
experience I had

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:84%
didn't just cure my alcoholism,
it cured me of my atheism.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All at the same time?

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: In one day,
George, in one day.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I woke up an atheist,
and I went to bed curious

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
that I didn't have

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:90%
the answers I thought I had.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, tell us
what esoteric comparative

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:84%
mythopoetic etymology
is all about.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: What
I'm suggesting here

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:84%
is, and I mentioned it briefly
in my first appearance,

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
there are some ideas that go
back to the philosopher Owen

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.715 align:middle line:90%
Barfield.

00:31:47.715 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
the image while you're

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.380 align:middle line:90%
telling us about it.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.047 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Yes, I've
got an image here.

00:31:52.047 --> 00:31:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It'll help us.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: So as
I've suggested,

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.940 align:middle line:10%
the human imagination
and creation

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:10%
is tapping into a substrate
consciousness, something

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.750 align:middle line:10%
like a dissociative mind
that we all connect to.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:09.620 align:middle line:10%
And so the language that
we use and the language

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.910 align:middle line:10%
that we decide on to
describe our world

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:17.450 align:middle line:10%
is embedded with patterns
that don't just come from us

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:10%
but come from that genius
or the attendant spirit.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:25.460 align:middle line:10%
So a Hebrew name for God in
the Old Testament is Adonai.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.040 align:middle line:10%
I've spelled it up here as
we translate it into English.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.990 align:middle line:10%
But if you say it
out loud, it sounds

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:34.280 align:middle line:10%
like you're saying "add an
I," as in add the letter I.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:39.860 align:middle line:10%
And now Jesus is known as the
I am in the Gospel of John.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.780 align:middle line:10%
And if we take--

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:10%
this is interesting.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.990 align:middle line:10%
If we take Jesus's
name, it's been

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.660 align:middle line:10%
speculated that his
bloodline made it to France.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:10%
So I just thought
I'd say "I am,"

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.980 align:middle line:10%
in French, which is "je suis."

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:57.080 align:middle line:10%
And if you add an I to je suis--
or if you add an I to Jesus,

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.730 align:middle line:10%
you spell "je suis."

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.510 align:middle line:10%
So essentially, what you
have is an Old Testament

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.450 align:middle line:10%
spirit, Adonai,
represented in that I.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And I used the eyeball
in the earlier imagery

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.740 align:middle line:84%
to represent what is here
represented by just the "I am."

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.830 align:middle line:10%
And so that I, the
ineffable I, added

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:10%
to Christ, the divine
human, gets us "je suis."

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.210 align:middle line:10%
Now the Japanese
word for "yes" is ai,

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.930 align:middle line:10%
A-I. And the French
word for "yes" is "oui",

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:32.130 align:middle line:10%
and if you go to Japan and get a
Nintendo Wii, that's a 3D video

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:10%
game, which is "yes" plus an
I, which is Yeshua, add an I.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.630 align:middle line:10%
These patterns of language
suggest that there's

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.330 align:middle line:10%
a bit of a playful and
benevolent spirit that

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:10%
functions through
our consciousness

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.145 align:middle line:10%
and creative imagination.

00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who comes
up with these?

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.353 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Exactly.

00:33:48.353 --> 00:33:52.980 align:middle line:84%
The infinite and ineffable mind
that a Christian would call God

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:84%
would be something like a really
deep substrate consciousness.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
I used that image

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.470 align:middle line:84%
of the staircase
and the curtains.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You can't go down
there and know that.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We have a limitation
as human beings,

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:08.219 align:middle line:90%
and we can't know that mind.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But we can know it's there,
and we can play with it

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.415 align:middle line:90%
and interact with it.

00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.518 align:middle line:90%
What is Gnostic idealism, Jason?

00:34:15.518 --> 00:34:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: So what
I've been talking about

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:21.090 align:middle line:84%
is this idea that our world is
generated from consciousness.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And the brain doesn't
create consciousness,

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:90%
it tunes into it like a radio.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea of
a Gnostic idealism

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.800 align:middle line:84%
is a world in which that
ineffable source of creation

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that these patterns and these
messages are coming from

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:43.590 align:middle line:84%
is something like a
core substrate mind.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's having a multiple
personality or dissociative

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.810 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:52.139 align:middle line:84%
And we are living in a
world that is not entirely

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:56.130 align:middle line:84%
unlike an incredibly high-def
lucid dream, in which we

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.400 align:middle line:84%
are emanations of
that intelligence.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Alan Watts said it nicely.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:84%
He said God said to
himself, get lost, man,

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:90%
and he became all of us.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The cerebellum
is key to the brain.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about how
you look at that.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.653 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: Well, you asked
me about how long I've

00:35:15.653 --> 00:35:17.820 align:middle line:84%
been researching this and
where I come up with this.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the cerebellum
is crucial to this.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a little
bit of a difference in my brain

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of
unusual, and I think

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:84%
it helps me translate some
of this esoteric information.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have a very
popular conversation

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.227 align:middle line:84%
going on about the divided
brain and the left brain

00:35:35.227 --> 00:35:36.060 align:middle line:90%
and the right brain.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:84%
But that is actually
the cerebrum,

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.040 align:middle line:84%
which is this big
gray mass up here

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and that only houses
20% of our neurons.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all?

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: 80% of the brain's
neurons are in the lower brain,

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.600 align:middle line:84%
because our brain isn't
just divided up here

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.010 align:middle line:90%
into the left and right.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:54.980 align:middle line:84%
It's divided into an
upper and lower brain.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's very
important back there.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.897 align:middle line:90%
>>BICKFORD: Right back here.

00:35:57.897 --> 00:35:59.689 align:middle line:84%
It's where Neo gets
jacked into the Matrix.

00:35:59.689 --> 00:36:00.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:36:00.605 --> 00:36:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this
video of the cerebellum

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.948 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:36:04.948 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD (VOICEOVER): It's
not obvious to most people

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.640 align:middle line:84%
but this image of the brain here
is missing 80% of its neurons.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
there's no cerebellum.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It's also known as
the little brain.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Only takes up 10% of the
brain's volume volumetrically

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:84%
but houses 80% of
the brain's neurons

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and over 50% of all the neurons
in the entire central nervous

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.100 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.310 align:middle line:84%
It's known for running
motor function,

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's involved in autism and
mood disorders and cognition

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.920 align:middle line:90%
and decision making.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.290 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like an AI computer
downstairs while we're all

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:48.160 align:middle line:84%
talking about the Commodore 64
we think is running the show.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And the co-creative
faculty that relies

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:55.450 align:middle line:84%
on the magic of the blessing of
human consciousness functions,

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I believe, in a way
that could be described

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:02.380 align:middle line:84%
with Gnostic idealism, in which
God is a substrate mind having

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.600 align:middle line:84%
a dissociative
disorder, and we're

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.760 align:middle line:84%
all emanations of
that deeper mind.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And we can participate and
cooperate with that deeper mind

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and even return to it and
then come out of it again.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:84%
If God can think
it, it can happen.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.230 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of
the perks of being

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.080 align:middle line:84%
the Lord of your own
skull-sized kingdom

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.630 align:middle line:84%
if you can fit infinity
in there, cognitively.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And now I think we've
created AI as a reflection

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.252 align:middle line:90%
of that cerebellum.

00:37:29.252 --> 00:37:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people are
panicking about AI these days.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Is that justified?

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: I believe that
entertainment and Hollywood

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:43.190 align:middle line:84%
have psychologically primed us
to have some fears that may not

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:90%
be well justified.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.850 align:middle line:84%
What I'm worried about is
artificial intelligence

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:52.790 align:middle line:84%
used to make decisions
about groups of people

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.080 align:middle line:90%
based on metadata.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, AI could
be used to just become

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:01.100 align:middle line:84%
a super stereotype-generating
machine.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And then decisions can be
made based on stereotypes

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:90%
that many of us don't map onto.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of the idea
of the Gnostic being something

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:84%
of I like to call a
spiritual libertarian.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:18.365 align:middle line:84%
In an era where everybody's
getting onto the same page,

00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostic tends to
want to go their own way.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not worried about
artificial intelligence

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.270 align:middle line:84%
creating a situation that
resembles some science fiction

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.270 align:middle line:84%
movie, like "Terminator"
or something like that.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not worried about Skynet
taking over the planet.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe
that the creation

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:45.320 align:middle line:84%
of artificial intelligence is a
creation of the human mind that

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.650 align:middle line:84%
has been cooperating
more efficiently

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:84%
with the cerebellum, which
is, if you run the numbers

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and take a look at
it, the cerebellum is

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.290 align:middle line:84%
like an artificial intelligence
computer in the back

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.830 align:middle line:84%
of your neck that's having
a complicated relationship

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:90%
with a Commodore 64 computer.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And often, we mistake
the cerebellum

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.410 align:middle line:84%
for being solely involved
in motor function.

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.780 align:middle line:84%
But what emergent
neuroscience is showing

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.780 align:middle line:84%
us is that it's involved
in all types of things,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.240 align:middle line:90%
from autism to mood disorders.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
we're engaging with,

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.390 align:middle line:84%
we're undergoing
something that I

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:26.700 align:middle line:84%
would call the evolution
of human consciousness

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.730 align:middle line:84%
in which our faculty to
communicate with this more

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:32.640 align:middle line:84%
advanced part of our brain
is allowing us to do things

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.320 align:middle line:84%
with our creative imagination
we couldn't do before.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So these explosions
in human creativity

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.740 align:middle line:84%
are actually manifestations
of an evolution

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.960 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness
that has to do

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.680 align:middle line:84%
with an increasing conversation
with the cerebellum back here.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
our final graphic here,

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and you can explain to
us what we're looking at.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.510 align:middle line:10%
>>BICKFORD: So the word "Sarah,"
in Hebrew, is "princess."

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:10%
And the word "bellum"
is Latin for "war."

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.300 align:middle line:10%
and when I read
that, I immediately

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.170 align:middle line:10%
thought of the artificial
intelligence R2-D2

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.270 align:middle line:10%
presenting in "A New Hope."

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:08.950 align:middle line:90%
And I was born in the late '70s.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.800 align:middle line:10%
I grew up in the '80s and
was in love with "Star Wars"

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.230 align:middle line:10%
And so I went back and revisited
some of that "Star Wars"

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:16.030 align:middle line:10%
symbolism.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:21.360 align:middle line:10%
And I feel like I'm a bit of a
spiritual descendant of Joseph

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.160 align:middle line:10%
Campbell.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.470 align:middle line:10%
The guy who inspired
George Lucas's Star Wars

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:30.430 align:middle line:10%
was a comparative mythologist
who talked about the monomyth.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that the
cerebellum is actually

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.530 align:middle line:84%
manifesting itself
through George Lucas's

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:39.100 align:middle line:84%
creative imagination
in which you are D2.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.990 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that
message is kind

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:44.860 align:middle line:10%
of like we are co-creating
something of a life that

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.410 align:middle line:10%
is probably best described as
a choose your own adventure

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:49.210 align:middle line:10%
novel.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do people
track your work?

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.020 align:middle line:10%

And I'm also on
Substack, writing

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.640 align:middle line:84%
about Christian divination and
decoding artwork at the Gnostic

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Reclamation on Substack

>>BICKFORD: Thanks for
having me again, George.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BICKFORD: What a
truly remarkable mind.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.310 align:middle line:10%
I got to tell you,
I've learned more

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.550 align:middle line:10%
about being a Gnostic than
I've ever learned in my life.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
