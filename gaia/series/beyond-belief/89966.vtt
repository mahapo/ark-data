00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:07.362 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.125 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.599 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to this edition

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.181 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:10%
So how many times have
you searched the internet

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:10%
or thumbnailed a newspaper
looking for your horoscope?

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:10%
Whatever you are-- Gemini
in my particular case.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:10%
It's fascinating, isn't it?

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:10%
The science of
stars, and planets,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:10%
and how it affects your life, or
your outcome, or your destiny?

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
With us on "Beyond Belief,"
of course, Sandra-Leigh Serio.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And Sandra is a psychotherapist,
but an astrologer,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.042 align:middle line:90%
an astrologer more, right?

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDRA-LEIGH SERIO: More,
yes, because with astrology you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
can take more liberty than
you can as a psychotherapist.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the old days,
before the internet,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.580 align:middle line:84%
the newspapers really
dived into astrology.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:84%
They had everybody's
month, everybody's chart,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:90%
the person of that day.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
They had it all laid
out for everybody.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Where do we stand
right now, in terms

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:84%
of people looking at
astrological charts

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.242 align:middle line:90%
on a personal basis?

00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: And I wrote
one of those columns

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:90%
for the newspaper, by the way.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You sure did.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: I did.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:10%
So sun sign astrology is
the tip of the iceberg.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:10%
It's sort of your introduction
to what astrology is.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:10%
But it's kind of like-- you
have to see sun sign astrology

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:10%
as a letter of the alphabet.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Unless you put the
letters together,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have a lot of
meaning to a lot of people.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So the whole world
is not divided

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
into 12 different
categories of personalities.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:84%
But it does give us a
good bird's eye view

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
of certain temperament
patterns of people.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what sun
sign astrology is about.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How come
people are so fascinated

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.959 align:middle line:90%
by their own astrological chart?

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: That's a
wonderful question.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.041 align:middle line:84%
People want to know
about themselves.

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
They're very
interested in who they

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
are, why they're here,
what their purpose is.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.015 align:middle line:90%
So of course they want to know.

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And they want to know,
am I really like that?

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Or am I not like that?

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to a party.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'll always
get one person who

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
will say to me, well,
guess what sign I am?

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're always a
Scorpio because Scorpios,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.670 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to
tell you anything.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
They want you to tell
them who they are.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's interesting
how your astrological sign

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.343 align:middle line:84%
is really related
to your personality.

00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:36.424 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.424 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:90%
I've got a couple daughters.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:90%
One is a Taurus.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:90%
She's bull-headed.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.733 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Bull-headed, yes.

00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
what Taurus is.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, I think, again,
it shows more temperament.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
The sun represents
your temperament

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and how you express yourself
and your individuality.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you're seeing
in her, is that side of her.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.269 align:middle line:84%
Now, she could have a
little Gemini in her chart.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
She could have a little
Aries in her chart,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:90%
like the adjoining signs.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And that would give yet another
dimension to her personality.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
But sun sign astrology,
to me it's like,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:90%
look, we live in America.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
to our government,

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:90%
our politics affects us, right?

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't affect someone
so much in England, maybe,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:90%
as it would affect us.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it
is with sun signs.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So we can look at the planets
in the sky, and where they are.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we can look at how they
affect each individual sign.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And so most people will
experience a similar type

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of event or experience
happening to them.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Like, they feel held back.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%
They feel opened up.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
They feel opportunity
coming, whatever.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.234 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of the yin and yang.

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By planetary
alignment, can you

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
determine somebody's
astrological chart

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:90%
based on the year, for example?

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Will year one be
different from year two?

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Sure, because
the sky keeps moving.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the same position.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:90%
It's always moving.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
We have slower moving planets
like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Neptune, and Pluto.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So they're moving so
slowly that they're only

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:84%
going to be in a certain
place at certain times,

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:90%
like certain years.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, you can take a
person born in a certain year.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.673 align:middle line:84%
So, like, all Geminis
are not the same.

00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:17.339 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
have the same chart.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.047 align:middle line:84%
But you will have the
sun in the-- you'll

00:04:19.047 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
have one planet
in the same sign.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sandra, what tools
do you use for astrology?

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.215 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well,
computers are wonderful.

00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
In my day, we learned
everything by hand.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
We actually did mathematical
calculations of the chart.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you were-- took any of
the testing programs, which

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I did, you had to
actually use a slide rule.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:84%
You had to actually
calculate a chart

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:90%
for anywhere in the world.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And you had to pinpoint the
degree of the horizon, which

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:84%
was using trigonometry
was a form of that.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
But now with computers, we
can give out so much more

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:84%
information to the
client because we have it

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:90%
at our fingertips.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So we can draw charts up called
solar returns for the day

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that the sun returns
on your birthday.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And we look at the
planets for that day that

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:90%
colors the whole year.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And we just have so much
more we can do instantly

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:90%
than we could ever do before.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.784 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Computers have
really done it, haven't they?

00:05:11.784 --> 00:05:14.242 align:middle line:84%
What, do you basically just
put in the person's name, birth

00:05:14.242 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:84%
date, and time and
just hit the button?

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.652 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: And the
geographical location.

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:90%
And you hit the button.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And the chart comes up.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.869 align:middle line:90%
So then you have the horizon.

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:24.243 align:middle line:84%
But it's good to know the math
behind it because then you

00:05:24.243 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:90%
know if you made a mistake.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you're
born near midnight,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
the sun would be in the fourth
house, the bottom of the chart.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you're born near noon,
it's at the top of the chart.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you did the
math in those days,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
then you would know if
you put in AM or PM--

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:84%
if you made a
mistake on your time.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.915 align:middle line:84%
So that's when one helpful
thing from some of us

00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
astrologers who have
been around a long time.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.415 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you use
tarot cards at all?

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: I use tarot cards.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I think tarot represent
what's going on in the moment.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And they can bring in the
influences of that moment.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And as an astrologer,
I like tarot

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
because it can either confirm
what I'm seeing in the chart

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:84%
or it can give me some
additional information.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So these are images coming
from the unconscious,

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:84%
but they're-- it's environmental
synchronicity, you know,

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:84%
anything that
happens in the world.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Like you're
interviewing someone,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and you go to sip your
water, and you spill it.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
That's very
significant, you know,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on
in the interview.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Depends
on where it spills.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.645 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Right.

00:06:21.645 --> 00:06:22.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With
tarot cards, do you

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:84%
tie it into the
astrological charts?

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Do you use them both together?

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Yes, yes some
people do a tarot spread

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
that is a circle that looks
like an astrological chart.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So each placement of that card
represents a different house

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:90%
in astrology.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And the houses show
the area of your life

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
where you're going to
have the experience.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:90%
So the planet tells you what.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
There's the what, meaning
what we're talking about.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Venus, we're talking about love.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Or Saturn, we're
talking about business.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:90%
So it shows you the what.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:84%
The house shows you where it's
most likely to be expressed.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And the sign is
going to show you

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:84%
how you will
express that energy.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have talked
about free will in the past.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
How does free will
enter this picture

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.565 align:middle line:84%
when your astrological
chart is already determined?

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, because
of your choices.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you--
This is where people

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
need to have awareness
about who they are.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And they need to have a little
bit of expanded consciousness.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't expect that
for everyone in the world

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:84%
because you know what's going
on in the world with all

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:84%
these atrocities
that are happening.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
But if someone is
a seeker, and they

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:84%
have a little bit
of awareness, they

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:84%
can see, like, I
get women who choose

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:84%
the same type of relationship
that is very bad for them.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
But if they have the awareness
of why they're choosing it,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:84%
so that's where your
psychology comes in.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.487 align:middle line:84%
Why are you choosing
someone like that?

00:07:47.487 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Then they're better able, once
they have the knowledge, right,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
to make a better decision and
to recognize their patterns.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.491 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they can't
alter their future?

00:07:56.491 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: I believe you
can alter your future.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But I have to be honest,
very few people do.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:90%
I think you need to meditate.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I think you need to do
spiritual disciplines.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
things that would

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
help you make better
choices in your life.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And also, again, the
awareness, the knowledge,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and the information is going to
help you make better choices.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when you say very
few people change their future,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.250 align:middle line:84%
is it because they
don't know how?

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Or they just don't want to?

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, the consciousness
isn't raised enough, I feel.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.167 align:middle line:84%
They're not-- They don't
have that within them

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:29.667 align:middle line:84%
to see where they're
making mistakes

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:33.070 align:middle line:84%
or where some-- They don't see
the consequences, necessarily,

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:90%
of their actions.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's harder,
George, when you're younger,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think
you care as much.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:84%
You have that kind of devil
may care attitude, most people,

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:90%
when they're young.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.984 align:middle line:84%
I think wisdom comes
in for a lot of people

00:08:43.984 --> 00:08:44.775 align:middle line:90%
when they're older.

00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sandra, how do you
really change your destiny?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Whether you look at an
astrological chart or not,

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
how do people step in and say,
I'm going to change my future?

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:90%
How do they do that?

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: I think a lot of it is
people who are very determined.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:90%
And they don't give up.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They don't recognize
failure in their life.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:90%
They just keep going.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
understand, there

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:90%
is a destiny aspect to it.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like a dog on
a chain, on a leash.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And within that realm, the
dog does have free will,

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:84%
how far he or she
can move within that.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:90%
But they're limited.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like you take
these prodigies, right?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's say Elton
John was playing

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the piano when he
was four years old.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't doing that.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have the
innate talent to do that.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.380 align:middle line:84%
That's part of destiny about
where your talents are.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to change it,
you've got to work at it.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:84%
You've got to say, well, I
don't want to be that person.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
you can change it.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But not enough people
apply themselves.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you work
at something long enough,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:90%
you can get very good at it.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But as you know, there's
a lot of talented people

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:90%
in our world.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
You watch some of these shows
that put amateur singers on,

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're incredibly talented,
but they're not famous.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
So what's the difference?

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
The difference is the
astrological chart.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
The difference is their
destiny at this point.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And also the fact that they
see themselves that way.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of very famous people,
when they were very young,

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
really kind of knew
inside that they

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.237 align:middle line:84%
were going to be
famous because they

00:10:22.237 --> 00:10:24.195 align:middle line:84%
knew they were going to
be a star in some ways.

00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would the charts
determine that, too?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Oh, absolutely.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could tell?

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: You could tell
that they had the potential.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Remember this thing
about environment.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It's also-- But you can
get beyond environment

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:90%
easily enough, right?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
But, again, environment
does influence you.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.375 align:middle line:90%
So you have to work within that.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If someone comes to
you, do they bring you tools?

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.040 align:middle line:84%
What do they need to
take to you for you

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.374 align:middle line:84%
to do a reading on
them, for example?

00:10:51.374 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well you
need, of course,

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the day, month, and
year of the birth.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.446 align:middle line:84%
You need the
geographical location.

00:10:56.446 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Because think of
this, someone born

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.336 align:middle line:84%
in New York at the same
time as someone born in LA,

00:11:02.336 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have
a different chart

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.260 align:middle line:84%
because the sun is in
a different position.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a three
hour time change.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And so you need the
exact birth time,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:90%
which you cannot always get.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But you need an exact birth
time to really precisely put

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.859 align:middle line:90%
the chart into order, let's say.

00:11:17.859 --> 00:11:20.275 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, my birth time
was on the birth certificate.

00:11:20.275 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: You're very lucky.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I guess some
places don't do that.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: And some
places-- like Chicago

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:84%
is a bit of a nightmare
with daylight savings time

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
because they were on daylight
savings time in the '50s

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and in the '60s,
but they had a rule

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.356 align:middle line:84%
that the hospitals should
record it in standard time.

00:11:41.356 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So some hospitals
did, and some didn't.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.063 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's confusing.

00:11:44.063 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: It's very confusing.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
We always-- when we get a
Chicago birth time, especially

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.837 align:middle line:84%
during daylight savings time
only, you say, oh my goodness.

00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:53.420 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those
nightmare charts.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Which one is going to be right?

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think in
my particular case,

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
we had a sundial to determine
what time I was born,

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.760 align:middle line:84%
The alignment of the planets,
the alignment of the star

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
system, do they tie in together
for astrology, or do they--

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I guess the ancients
primarily used to look at what?

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.626 align:middle line:90%
The stars, the constellations?

00:12:16.626 --> 00:12:18.265 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.265 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Yeah, well, the
ancients looked at the con--

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
originally, the zodiac was named
after the constellations that

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.370 align:middle line:90%
were in the backdrop of the sky.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:90%
And then that has moved.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
systems of astrology.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I have great respect for
all systems of astrology.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But we-- Western astrologers
use a tropical zodiac, tropical

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's based
on the seasons.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So our zodiac starts
March 21st or 22nd,

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:84%
whenever the first
day of spring is,

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:90%
and it's the spring equinox.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we
start our chart.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, as we move into
wintertime and areas like that,

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.475 align:middle line:90%
and fall, the fall season.

00:12:58.475 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Does that change?

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Does that determine
what's going on?

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.042 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, in an individual
chart, yes, when you're born.

00:13:06.042 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And just think if you
lived in Australia,

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.515 align:middle line:84%
everything is flipped so
our summer is their winter.

00:13:10.515 --> 00:13:11.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.390 align:middle line:90%
And I've worked in Australia.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a very fascinating place.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And so birth charts are
very individual to you

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
in the place and time
and where you're born.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again,
that's your destiny.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the destiny pattern
that's ahead of you.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
change your future?

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.075 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:30.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Even with free will, but I
mean, you can't physically

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:90%
change your astrological chart.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:90%
It is what it is, right?

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:90%
So how do they change?

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.186 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Visualization.

00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:90%
There are techniques.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that you can
create things and manifest

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:90%
things and bring them to you.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.175 align:middle line:90%
But you have to really want it.

00:13:46.175 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing is
you have to really believe

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:90%
you could do it.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.454 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the
belief you could do it,

00:13:51.454 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:90%
it's never going to happen.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I do believe that
people can make changes here.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they say the
point of power is in the moment.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And I totally
believe that changing

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
your pattern, your personality
pattern, in that moment,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:90%
how you respond to someone.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:84%
You're driving down the
street, this guy cuts you off.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.377 align:middle line:90%
Usually swear at him.

00:14:11.377 --> 00:14:12.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Road rage him!

00:14:12.335 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yeah, road rage.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So what, if in that moment,
you were aware of it

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and stopped yourself
and said, you know what?

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he didn't see me.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, whatever.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
that starts to change.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.433 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe he's
just a bad driver.

00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Right.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't know any better.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment, that
can change who you are.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:90%
That's very powerful stuff.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But, again, very
few people do that.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Very few people
have the awareness

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.715 align:middle line:90%
that they could do that.

00:14:37.715 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes,
Sandra, life is

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:90%
based on split second decisions.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:84%
That decision can alter
your life, your future,

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
could change everything, whether
you go through a red light

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
where maybe you would get
hit at the intersection.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:84%
For one quick second, it
changes your whole life.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Does astrology pinpoint that?

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: It can pinpoint
life changes, absolutely.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:10%
That's the planet
Uranus, which is

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:10%
sort of the kind of loose
cannon of the zodiac

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:10%
because when Uranus comes
through a chart, anything goes.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Your life is going to
change beyond your control.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But it changes to get
you on another path,

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.675 align:middle line:84%
because maybe you're missing
the path, your destiny.

00:15:20.675 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
You're missing
what you should be

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:84%
doing in life, what
your purpose is.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:84%
So this planet Uranus
comes through, and boom.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:90%
It takes things away from you.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And you must move in
another direction.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
trust those things.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Instead of lamenting
what happened to us,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and we're victims,
and all that, you

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.870 align:middle line:84%
have to see that there's a
brighter future beyond this.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:90%
This is why it's happening.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:84%
It's going to bring you
something very good.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Out of every adversity--
this is Napoleon Hill--

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:84%
out of every adversity
comes the seed of a greater

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:90%
or equivalent benefit.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So you have to live that
as part of your life.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here's the
$64,000 question.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
How does an alignment
of stars and planets

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:90%
determine who you are?

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.275 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: It seems sort of
far-fetched, doesn't it?

00:16:06.275 --> 00:16:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's very strange.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.489 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: It seems like
it's way out there.

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And don't we wish we knew
exactly what the answer was

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.260 align:middle line:90%
to that?

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know
is as above, so below.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:84%
It might reflect the
pattern of what's

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
going on, just like the
moon affects the tides.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But you could say,
oh, that's gravity.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I think with the planets,
they're symbolic.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:90%
They're archetypes.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And archetypes are common
experiences-- experiences

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that are common to
every person here.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Even if you never got married
or never had a relationship,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.490 align:middle line:84%
you still have an
experience of love,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
whether it's to your pet,
whatever it is, or to art

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's more about archetypes.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's affec--
They say when you're born,

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:84%
you agree to come
into this Earth plane,

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and you will be governed by
the rules of the Earth plane,

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:84%
which have a lot
to do with gravity,

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:84%
but have a lot to do
with things that happen.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:90%
We see sadness.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.590 align:middle line:90%
We see murders.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:90%
We see all kinds of things.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
But we agree to all
this ahead of time.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So we can't say, why
did it happen to me?

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Why am I the victim, right?

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
We draw these things to us a
lot by what we do in our lives,

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When a
person's born, Sandra,

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:84%
it determines, of course,
the astrological outcome.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:28.249 align:middle line:84%
Do we determine when
we're born as individuals?

00:17:28.249 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: I believe we do.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely believe that.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe we choose
who our parents are,

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
because it chooses
the environment

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:90%
we want to be born into.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that you
come into the world

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:84%
when you fit, when
you're a fit into it,

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
because then it creates all
the experiences that you want

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to have to evolve into a more
perfect being, of course, which

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:84%
can take many, many,
many lifetimes.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My father
was a premature baby.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:90%
He was a twin.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.370 align:middle line:84%
They were both born seven
months in, not nine months.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Did that have an outcome
on his life, the fact

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.282 align:middle line:90%
that he came two months earlier?

00:18:05.282 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: I don't think it
had an outcome on his life.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.040 align:middle line:84%
It was still the way the
sky was at the moment he

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:90%
took that first breath.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:84%
But that's a good question,
like Caesarean sections,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:84%
You think the doctor's
determining that,

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:90%
but not necessarily.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:84%
The baby innately knows
when it's going to be born.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And just like parents, how
they name their children,

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that's always
another fascin-- that

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
would be another fascinating
show because sometimes

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
names really have a great
deal of meaning behind them.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question about it.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.113 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: And so it's
not coincidental.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're drawn to things
that we're connected to.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're drawn into
the Earth plane

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.344 align:middle line:90%
because we're connected to it.

00:18:41.344 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
a friend of ours,

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:90%
her name is Maryanna Korwitts.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote a book called
"Name Power 101," which

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
determines exactly what you
said, that your name determines

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
who you end up being,
your personality.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're William,
and another kid is Billy,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:90%
they're different.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.544 align:middle line:84%
Their personalities
are different.

00:19:04.544 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing how that works.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:06.668 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: It is amazing.

00:19:06.668 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that how that's labeling?

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.057 align:middle line:84%
But there's such
meaning behind words

00:19:10.057 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that we have-- That's why
we have-- You can really

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
hurt people with your words
if you're not careful.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.814 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does science
stand with all of this?

00:19:16.814 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Oh, they think
it's a bunch of hooey.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.438 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:19:19.438 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: It's OK.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Astrologers don't care about
that, nor do tarot readers,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:90%
or palmists.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
We know we have our work
to do to help people.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And we help them
in any way we can.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:84%
But I respect the
scientific community.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They brought us great
advances in many things.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
But they're just
not-- they don't quite

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
have the awareness about
the other side of the brain

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:84%
yet, or the invisible
world, as we call it,

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:84%
or energies that they can't
replicate in an experiment.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's true.

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You can take two people born
at exactly the same time,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and they may have
different lives,

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:84%
in a way, because they
make different choices.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to have a lot
of similarities in those lives.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:84%
They've done things where
twins were separated at birth.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they found
each other, they

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
couldn't believe the
similarities in their lives,

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:90%
because that's personality.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And personality
determines character.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And character
determines destiny.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, what about twins?

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.389 align:middle line:84%
Born on the same day, born
within minutes of each other.

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Are they different?

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: They can be.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
If those minutes change
their rising sign,

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
which changes about
every two hours or so.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.407 align:middle line:84%
But if they're born in
that little bit of space,

00:20:33.407 --> 00:20:34.990 align:middle line:84%
the changes that
they're going to have

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
different expressions
of personality.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:90%
But they can be very similar.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I've observed a lot
of twins in my life.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:90%
And I find, like-- I knew twins.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And one was a psychotherapist.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:90%
And the other one was a psychic.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But they were both dealing
with people, and personality,

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:90%
and trying to help people.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So it was very similar
in their expression.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And with those same twins,
this was fascinating.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:84%
One was married, and
one was not married.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.639 align:middle line:84%
When the married one
went through a divorce,

00:21:00.639 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
you say, well, then what
happened to the unmarried one?

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:90%
She didn't have a husband.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.836 align:middle line:90%
Well, she worked for her father.

00:21:05.836 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And her father closed
the business down.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So they had the same
experience, a loss

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:90%
of a key man in their life, yes.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
That's how astrology
works, experience,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:90%
what it means to them.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But it was a different
event, but the same meaning.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is astrology
only for an individual?

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.827 align:middle line:84%
Or can it be for a
timetable of an event?

00:21:30.827 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Absolutely.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.534 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the birth
of the United States,

00:21:33.534 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:84%
like, here's an
example, 9/11/2001,

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.830 align:middle line:84%
horrible moment
for this country.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Can you chart that?

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Sure, the
towers came down.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:84%
They were born when Saturn,
which is a karmic planet,

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.770 align:middle line:84%
was in Gemini, the
sign of the twins.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And they, unfortunately, came
down at their Saturn return.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Now people get Saturn
returns at age 28, 29,

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and again at 58, 59, and
again in the early 80s, right?

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.842 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, you can
see that it was--

00:22:06.842 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:90%
there's such a pattern there.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just fascinating.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But you asked a good
question because Carl Jung

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:84%
said anything done or
born at a moment of time

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:84%
has the qualities of
that moment of time.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's astrology.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:90%
He believed in astrology.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:84%
He wrote about it, felt like
people should know astrology.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, so you can have
a chart for a wedding.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
You can have a chart for
when you met someone.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
You can have a chart for
when you started this show.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And it will show us a lot about
the inner workings of the show

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:90%
or the event at that time.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of my guests
on "Coast to Coast"

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:84%
are a couple of people,
George Hart and Paul Guercio

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:90%
who head up the Merlin Project.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a computerized-based system
that time tracks people's lives

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:90%
well into the future.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And you will look
at a time track.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And, again, they
grab the information

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that you look for, their
birth date, the time.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:90%
And they put it into a computer.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And what it does
is it shows spikes

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.175 align:middle line:90%
in the person's life in years.

00:23:15.175 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:84%
It does not tell them
what's going to happen.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea
what's going to happen.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:90%
But they will look at a chart.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:84%
They might look at
George Noory's chart.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And it may say, 2003,
it may be a huge spike.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 2003,
that's when I started

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:84%
doing "Coast to Coast"
radio full time.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew what it was.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But some major event was
going to occur in their life.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:90%
And they do that.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I guess it's like astrology.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.615 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: It is very much.

00:23:44.615 --> 00:23:46.740 align:middle line:84%
That's fascinating they're
using birth information.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if they're
using like biorhythms.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.087 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what criteria is
the basis for their experiment.

00:23:53.087 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But I will definitely
look that up later on.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: That
sounds fascinating.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can
clearly see the spikes.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.676 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: You see the spikes.

00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's like Saturn
returns are spikes for people,

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:84%
because you always want to
build a stronger foundation.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a foundation
that you're used to

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.910 align:middle line:84%
is taken away, like you get
divorced, you lose your job,

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:84%
or you finish
school, or whatever.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's like starting
over a little bit.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people are governed
by those particular cycles

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to advise
people in terms of astrology,

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.305 align:middle line:84%
how they can use it in their
life, what would you tell them?

00:24:26.305 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: I'd tell them
just be aware of where

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:84%
the planets are at
any given moment.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And be aware of these
retrograde Mercury cycles.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:84%
When things do fall
apart, it's not

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.066 align:middle line:84%
like you shouldn't
sign any document

00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:90%
under a retrograde Mercury.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't necessarily
live like that

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.590 align:middle line:84%
because Mercury's retrograde
for about three weeks.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:90%
But at least be aware of it.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Read the fine print.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Again, awareness is
everything in a person's life.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So astrology can be helpful,
like certain signs that

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:84%
attract each other tend to
conflict a lot of the time.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they have to
work through things.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
If you took Bill and
Hillary Clinton, he's Leo,

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and she's Scorpio.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Those are very
conflicting energies.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:90%
They've been through a lot.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:90%
But, see, they're fixed signs.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And what do fixed signs do?

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.172 align:middle line:90%
They stay together.

00:25:11.172 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For whatever reason.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.255 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: For whatever
reason, right, but they

00:25:14.255 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:90%
weather the storm.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.691 align:middle line:84%
You see, that's where knowing
astrology is a good thing.

00:25:18.691 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well I was going
to ask you, too, then,

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.246 align:middle line:84%
about compatibility
of individuals.

00:25:22.246 --> 00:25:24.210 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Would you do
something like that?

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: I do that all the time.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.196 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:25:27.196 --> 00:25:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: And when I met my
husband, I knew him socially.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.876 align:middle line:90%
But he came for a session.

00:25:31.876 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at that chart.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, whoa, you know,
I knew we had a connection.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:90%
And I had a feeling about it.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little
bit of intuition

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of astrology.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.171 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY:Now, could the
connection be good or bad?

00:25:42.171 --> 00:25:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: It could
be good or bad.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.800 align:middle line:84%
You kind of know when--
I once had an assistant.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And her Saturn, which
is the karmic planet,

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
the demanding planet,
was conjunct my sun sign.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough, I was the boss.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.572 align:middle line:90%
She was older than I was.

00:25:56.572 --> 00:25:58.280 align:middle line:84%
She was not going to
take orders from me.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:90%
She was not going to listen.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And she left there after a week.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I had a feeling it wasn't
going to turn out well.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So you look at these Saturn
connections between people

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.390 align:middle line:84%
because it tells you a lot about
how they're going to get along.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Because if one is too
stern, or too parental,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.722 align:middle line:84%
that's not going to
work with someone

00:26:13.722 --> 00:26:15.013 align:middle line:90%
like an Aries or a Sagittarius.

00:26:15.013 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't work
in relationships.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can see where there
can be destructiveness.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And you sometimes--
you never tell

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:90%
people what to do in a session.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But you give some
advice, or suggestions,

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and let them make
their own decisions.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:90%
But you can warn them.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Numerology, somewhat
different from astrology.

00:26:35.295 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Somewhat.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.658 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there
are some similarities.

00:26:37.658 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Cycles, again,
what number year are you in?

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, all these sciences to
me are divine sciences, George.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And they're all interconnected.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.484 align:middle line:84%
And they're beautiful
to know about them.

00:26:48.484 --> 00:26:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
you see, Sandra,

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:84%
astrology going in
the next millennium?

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: Well, I think
astrology will continue

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.065 align:middle line:84%
to grow because it is
accurate, because it is useful.

00:26:59.065 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fun, too.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: It is fun.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And the internet,
I think, is really

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:84%
allowing information
and education

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.660 align:middle line:84%
to get out there
about astrology.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
people-- more and more

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.210 align:middle line:84%
people can be self-taught
because of the internet.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
beautiful information

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.570 align:middle line:84%
at your fingertips on anything
that you want to know.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:90%
So I think astrology will grow.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I do believe, maybe
not in my lifetime,

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:29.466 align:middle line:84%
but it will be recognized more
as a significant contribution.

00:27:29.466 --> 00:27:30.810 align:middle line:90%


00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Just like in India, astrology
is very well-revered in India.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.070 align:middle line:84%
It's totally different
than in the United States.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the majority
of the people in the world

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.050 align:middle line:90%
believe in reincarnation.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just that some of us in
the Western world, I think,

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
are more reluctant
to believe it.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.962 align:middle line:84%
But so, yes, I think it's
interesting, isn't it,

00:27:48.962 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to study other countries,
other cultures.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:84%
You learn a lot about
the world we live in.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you seen anything
astrologically speaking

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:84%
that is so frightening,
so planet-ending,

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.480 align:middle line:84%
that it has scared the
living daylights out of you?

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: No, I have not.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.059 align:middle line:84%
I do not think
that-- I mean, I've

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:07.600 align:middle line:84%
read about things
where they say this

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
is the Earth's going
to end this day.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:90%
It never does.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're never right.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you don't see it.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.195 align:middle line:84%
Or you don't
interpret it that way.

00:28:14.195 --> 00:28:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Both.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:90%
I just don't see it.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe if you're talking
how many years in the future,

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.030 align:middle line:90%
the sun is going to burn out.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:90%
We know that, right?

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's not now.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not in this millennium.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to be
petrified of that, by the way.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.005 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a
science teacher when

00:28:30.005 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I was 13, 14 years
old, who would say,

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:90%
the sun's going to burn out.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, he did say five
billion years from now.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:90%
I would go home crying.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And say, Mom, Dad, the
sun's going to burn out.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me,
five billion years

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.765 align:middle line:90%
from now seemed like tomorrow.

00:28:47.765 --> 00:28:48.920 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And my dad would sit
me and say, George,

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:90%
let me tell you something.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.960 align:middle line:84%
That's five billion
years from now.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.090 align:middle line:90%


00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.874 align:middle line:84%
It took me a long time
not to worry about it.

00:29:00.874 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: Yeah, not to worry.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.081 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many other
Earth-like like planets

00:29:04.081 --> 00:29:05.600 align:middle line:90%
now they're discovering, right?

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you reincarnate, you
might go to one of those planets

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.680 align:middle line:84%
where the sun is still
very alive and healthy.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to worry about that.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the
most exciting thing for you

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.245 align:middle line:90%
in astrology?

00:29:17.245 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SERIO: I think
learning about people

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and learning about-- I like
reading biographies on people

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and following it
along with the chart,

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.250 align:middle line:84%
like what happened at a
certain time in their life.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
pretty fascinating.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that, again, astrology
gives you a window into things.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.230 align:middle line:84%
It gives you information that
you just don't have without it.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think one
of the things it's

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:84%
done for me is it's made
me accept people more,

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.950 align:middle line:84%
because I figure, oh,
this person is difficult.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:84%
He or she must have a
t-square and fixed sign.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to be very
stubborn, very difficult

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:90%
at times.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So you accept
people more readily

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.370 align:middle line:84%
because you know that's
what they're like.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't make an
excuse, necessarily,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.040 align:middle line:84%
for their behavior,
because you can

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.120 align:middle line:84%
be in charge of
your own behavior.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.147 align:middle line:84%
But it at least makes you a
little more forgiving about it.

00:30:09.147 --> 00:30:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's important.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SERIO: It's important.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:10%
And if someone's
having a Mars aspect,

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.605 align:middle line:10%
they're going to be more
irritable, and more angry.

00:30:14.605 --> 00:30:16.300 align:middle line:10%
So you're a little
more forgiving.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.201 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of astrologers
talk the language.

00:30:18.201 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:10%
And they'll say, oh, I've
got a Mars aspect now.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.574 align:middle line:10%
So I know I'm
going to be crabby.

00:30:21.574 --> 00:30:23.310 align:middle line:10%
So just stay away from me.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:24.447 align:middle line:10%
We have our own language.

00:30:24.447 --> 00:30:25.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful language.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sandra, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.490 align:middle line:90%
So here's a little tip for you.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.830 align:middle line:90%
You know your birth date.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Find out when you were born.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:90%


00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Check your birth certificate
or maybe ask your parents

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.940 align:middle line:90%
if they're still around.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.890 align:middle line:10%
And find someone like
Sandra-Leigh Serio

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.600 align:middle line:10%
to truly give you an
astrological reading

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:10%
and determine what's going to
happen to you in the future.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.950 align:middle line:10%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
