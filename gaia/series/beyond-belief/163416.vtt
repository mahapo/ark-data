00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.430 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory,
and what a program

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:10%
we have in store
for you right now.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:84%
My special guest
is Andrew Collins.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
He is a researcher,
a noted author.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
He's written 15 books about
all kinds of mysteries,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and his latest is called
"The Cygnus Key," which we'll

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:90%
get into in just a moment.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Andrew, welcome to the program.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW COLLINS:
Thank you, George.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always
love meeting people

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
who have been on
a radio show when

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.019 align:middle line:84%
I don't have an opportunity to
because I hear you from afar.

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:84%
You're based in
England most of the--

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: I am.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --time, aren't you?

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.563 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes, yes.

00:00:51.563 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm based just outside of
London in the county of Essex

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:90%
overlooking the Thames Estuary.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I come from
when I'm on the phone to you.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in investigating some

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient mysteries?

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.360 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: Well, I
think I've always

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.510 align:middle line:10%
had an interest in these
right from when I was a child.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:10%


00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:10%
I had these interests,
and when I went to school

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:10%
I suddenly found that the other
kids didn't share the interest.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:10%
So at that point, you
start reaching out

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:10%
and looking for others
that share your interest.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So I joined groups
and organizations,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and I read books on UFOs,
ghosts, ancient mysteries,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
including Erich von
Daniken's "Chariots

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
of the Gods," which
showed me that there

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
was a whole number of ancient
sites around the world that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:84%
still had question marks
associated with them,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
whether it be the
Pyramids of Giza in Egypt,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
the Nazca Lines in Peru, or
any other of these great sites

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I wanted to
connect with them in some way,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
investigate them and find
out what made them tick.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you did, and
you did in a very big way.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Erich von Daniken, of
course, has his own program

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
here on Gaia, and I was
mesmerized by his work

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
when I was younger,
"Chariots of the Gods."

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Every time I'm
with Erich, I tell

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.810 align:middle line:84%
him, god, when I was a kid,
I loved reading your books.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm not that old.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But he's done a magnificent
job bringing these stories

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to the forefront
for us, as you have.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, your latest work is
called "The Cygnus Key."

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well,
"Cygnus" is a Latin word,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:90%
and it simply means "swan."

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And Cygnus is a constellation
in the northern part

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
of the sky, which is also
known as the Northern Cross,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:84%
because it looks obviously
like a cross shape in the sky.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And it is a place that has been
extra special to our ancestors

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
probably for at
least 17,000 years.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.255 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's depicted
in the caves of France,

00:02:57.255 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:84%
in the Ice Age friezes
and paintings there.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.640 align:middle line:84%
It's represented
by the orientation

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:84%
of various buildings around
the world, which are focused

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:90%
upon key stars of Cygnus.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's also mentioned
in various ancient texts.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Various ancient religions
seemed to particularly focus

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
on that particular
group of stars.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So there was something
important about it,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and I got on to its
significance in the early 2000s.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And I started to realize
that whereas most people were

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
aware of the importance
of, let's say,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Orion or the Pleiades, that
there was a missing key here,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:90%
and that was Cygnus.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have spent a
lot of time investigating

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
different regions of this
planet for these mysteries.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
One is in Turkey
called Gobekli Tepe.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what that is.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: Well, Gobekli
Tepe was discovered in 1994

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:10%
by an enlightened
German archaeologist

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:10%
by the name of
Professor Klaus Schmidt,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:10%
and he had been
working in the region.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:10%
And he climbed this
mountaintop one day

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:10%
and found that there
was a huge, ancient,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:10%
what they call an
occupational mound, or tepe,

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:10%
on the top of it, which was
about 300 yards by about

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.296 align:middle line:10%
200 yards in size by
about 45 feet in height.

00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jeez, on
top of this mountain?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:10%
And all around was evidence
of prehistoric activity

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:10%
in the form of flint tools,
which he could instantly date

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:10%
back at least 10,000 years.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:10%
But there were also
carved fragments

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:10%
of stone of beautiful
animals and human features.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:10%
And these he recognized
also as belonging

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.330 align:middle line:10%
to a very ancient
prehistoric people that

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:10%
existed in this region as a
[INAUDIBLE] as much as 10,000,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:10%
11,000, even 12,000 years ago.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And what's so strange is
that a team of scientists

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.459 align:middle line:84%
had visited the site in 1963,
and they'd seen these same--

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The same thing, right?

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --these same stone
carvings but dismissed them

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
as Byzantine, no more
than 1,000 years old,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.705 align:middle line:84%
because they looked so
beautifully finished.

00:05:16.705 --> 00:05:18.021 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: So they missed an
opportunity of investigating it

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:90%
back in the '60s.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
But Klaus Schmidt realized
the significance of this site

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and immediately began
excavations there,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
which have continued
from that day to this.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:10%
And what they've uncovered
is a whole series

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:10%
of what they call stone
enclosures, which consist

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:10%
of standing stones, of
megaliths, great stones,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:10%
which are in circles, just like
the stone circles of Europe.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
something like Stonehenge

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
but multiplied by
perhaps a dozen times.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
stones are covered

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:84%
in the most beautiful carved
imagery of birds and animals

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.710 align:middle line:90%
and insects.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But also, many of the
stones are anthropomorphic.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.673 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big
are they, Andrew?

00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:12.006 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: The tallest of
them are about 18 and 1/2 feet

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:90%
in height.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.440 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: These are these
huge monoliths, twin monoliths,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:10%
they have at the center
of these stone circles.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:10%
All of them have
these twin monoliths.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:10%
And the stones have these
T-shaped terminations,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:10%
which are abstract heads.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:10%
They also have in relief these
arms around the sides of them

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.410 align:middle line:10%
that come together in these
spindly fingers at the front,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:10%
carved fingers, to show
that the stones actually

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:10%
represent beings of some kind.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, as to what they represent,
they could be the first gods.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:90%
They could be celestial beings.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Or they could be
divine ancestors.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, these
people venerated

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
whoever was meant to be
signified by these stones.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: So I mean, and
there the mystery begins.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did ancients
carve out stones like that?

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.552 align:middle line:84%
What kind of tools
did they have?

00:07:10.552 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: At that time, they
certainly had no metal tools.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So everything must have been
done with stone tools, flint,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:90%
most obviously.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:10%
And there's no
secret in the fact

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:10%
that they were doing
it at this time,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:10%
because the quarries are nearby.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:10%
Experimental
archeology has shown us

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:10%
that you can actually carve
one of these reliefs of animals

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:10%
pretty quickly.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
A day or two is
all you would need.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And to actually create one
of the stone enclosures

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
would probably take
around a year to do.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But what's so significant is
the number of these enclosures.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Although there is about a dozen
that they've uncovered so far,

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
it's believed that there could
be anything up to 20 or even 50

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
still to be uncovered beneath
this layer cake, which

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
is made up of stone
rubble, of earth,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.275 align:middle line:84%
and general waste,
which was thrown on

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:90%
to cover over these enclosures.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I guess
erosion would do that, too?

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: No, no, I
think it was purposely--

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.245 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Covered up on purpose.

00:08:13.245 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: These were
purposely buried,

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:90%
not all at the same time.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.580 align:middle line:84%
What seems to have
happened is that they

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.163 align:middle line:84%
would create one of these stone
enclosures, which, by the way,

00:08:22.163 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
the oldest are the most
technologically accomplished

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.445 align:middle line:84%
and the most beautiful
and the largest,

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:31.824 align:middle line:84%
and they date to about
11,500 years ago.

00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
long time ago, Andrew.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, it's the
end of the last Ice Age,

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:84%
I mean, within a century
or so of the actual end

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:90%
of the last Ice Age.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people do you think

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:84%
may have lived in
that region up there?

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, actually,
at Gobekli Tepe, none.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.951 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: This was a
site that was either

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.089 align:middle line:90%
for ceremonial or civic usage.

00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:90%
People didn't live there.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:84%
They may have stayed there
maybe for a few days.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.131 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they would live
down below on the mountain.

00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, they lived
in settlements perhaps five,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:90%
eight miles away.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Because various mounds have
been found of activity,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:84%
which shows that these
people lived there, probably

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
near water sources, and then
moved up onto the mountaintop

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:90%
to do all the work.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're dealing here with
hundreds, if not thousands,

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:84%
of people being brought
together at a time when,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
in theory, there were no
cities anywhere in the world.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the rituals
would have taken place

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:90%
at specific times.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But of course, it's
what was going on here.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why build this?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Why do this?

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Why do this?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got
to be a purpose for it.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, I mean,
there was no cities.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
All you had at this time was
hunter-gatherers officially,

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:90%
officially, hunter-gatherers.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that means
they hunt, they eat.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:90%
They hunt, they eat, right?

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: They do
their own thing.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.550 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
little family units, maybe

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.270 align:middle line:84%
an extended family
group or social group.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.470 align:middle line:90%
They were nomadic.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
They would just maybe
settle for a few months

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and then move on and have like
a cycle that would probably

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:90%
last like five years.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:84%
This is how archaeologists
see hunter-gatherers.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And people say,
well, I don't believe

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:84%
that Gobekli Tepe could have
been made by hunter-gatherers.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:84%
There must have been an
advanced civilization.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that's
the case, well, we

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
need to find that lost
civilization, which

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.437 align:middle line:90%
takes us on to the next level.

00:10:22.437 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The next
level, that's right.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: But officially, we
only have hunter-gatherers.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But they must have been very
clever hunter-gatherers,

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:90%
because there were carvers.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%
They could quarry these stones.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
They made these
beautiful monuments,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:84%
which were technologically
advanced in a manner that

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
was unique to the
planet at this time.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists
consider Gobekli Tepe

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to be the first
"monumental architecture"--

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:90%
that's the term they use--

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.337 align:middle line:84%
anywhere in the
world officially,

00:10:53.337 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:90%
officially at least.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.211 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty dramatic.

00:10:55.211 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden, who has a series
on Gaia called "Missing Links,"

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:90%
is fascinated with Gobekli Tepe.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: We're
looking at evidence

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
of advanced technological
civilizations

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
during a time we were
told only primitive mud

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:84%
huts in primitive
societies were existing.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's so many
of these anomalies

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
that we could take the
time to explore right now,

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like to
cut to the chase.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I want to spend a
little bit of time

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:84%
on the oldest technologically
advanced civilization

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that science has now
agreed is a technologically

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.655 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilization, and
they've agreed upon the dates.

00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a very mysterious site.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:10%
It's located in southern Turkey
near the Syrian border, which

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:10%
makes it a very difficult
place for archaeologists

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:10%
to get into right now because of
the war that's happening there.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
It is called Gobekli
Tepe, Gobekli Tepe.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And it is a site that
has been on the radar

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
of some archaeologists
for some time.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.497 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.497 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Andrew, how
long do you think

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
it took for the indigenous
people of that era

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.570 align:middle line:90%
to build that place?

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, I think
each enclosure probably

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:84%
took about a year to construct,
and it was built successively

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:19.745 align:middle line:84%
over a period of time,
probably around 1,500 years,

00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:20.545 align:middle line:90%
from about 9,500.

00:12:20.545 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 1,500
years to build this?

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, I mean, stage by stage.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In stages.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I think that each
of the enclosures

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
would have been in use
for, I'm going to guess,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:90%
100 years, something like that.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
end of it, it would

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:39.099 align:middle line:84%
seem to have been
decommissioned and covered over.

00:12:39.099 --> 00:12:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they would build
another one next to it,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.870 align:middle line:84%
or they would build
it on top of that.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So gradually, the occupational
mound is extending outwards

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.170 align:middle line:90%
and also upwards as well.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the oldest
structures actually

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
on the bedrock, and you've
got the young structures

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:90%
at the top.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But what's so significant is
that the oldest structures

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:90%
are really sophisticated.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.300 align:middle line:90%
They're really advanced.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything about them
suggests a high culture.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.821 align:middle line:84%
But those that are the
youngest are minuscule in size.

00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're almost the
size of something like sort

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:90%
of a tiny family room.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And because they
have these benches

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
around them, these
tiny little stones,

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.172 align:middle line:84%
it almost gives the impression
of like a family Jacuzzi

00:13:28.172 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right--

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: It's very odd.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --where
they just gathered.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: It's almost
like they were going

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:90%
through the motions at the end.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- it was like they
had to keep up a certain style.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:84%
They had to still create these
stones, these T-shaped stones,

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's almost they'd forgotten
why they were doing it.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
around 8,000

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
BC they give up completely,
and they move out.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But something has
changed by this time,

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:84%
because during this
1,500-year window, there's--

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This building window.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: This
building window, we have

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:84%
what's known as the
Neolithic Revolution.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And this begins in this very
area of the globe, I mean,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
within sight of Gobekli Tepe,
and it cannot be unconnected.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.455 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
invention of agriculture,

00:14:19.455 --> 00:14:22.420 align:middle line:84%
of animal domestication
and animal

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:84%
husbandry, of metal work, the
first beer, the first wine.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Lots of different
firsts for humanity

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:84%
all begin within
sight of Gobekli Tepe,

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and that's no coincidence.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whenever we hear
about ancient discoveries,

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
like Baalbek in Lebanon, we
think of extraterrestrials,

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:90%
or it's a landing port for UFOs.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
there which would

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
lead you to believe
that there was

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
extraterrestrial involvement,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.322 align:middle line:84%
or it was a landing base
on top of the mountain?

00:14:55.322 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I don't think
it was a landing base.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.630 align:middle line:90%
I have to be honest.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I can say is
that this area, the mountains,

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
which is the most
southerly-most extent of what's

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
known as the Anti-Taurus Range,
are well known for UFO lights.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:84%
They've been seen for
hundreds of years,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:90%
and they're still seen today.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that one
of the reasons for siting

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe at
that location was

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
because of the strange
lights that were being seen.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But secondly, the carved
imagery of many of the stones

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:84%
is so alien, so
strange, so unique

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:84%
that you could look at it and
think that these people could

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
have been in touch with
celestial beings or something

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that was guiding them
to carve in this manner.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, these
carvings that are so unique,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:90%
what do they depict?

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, many animals
and creatures and birds.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.029 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That are indigenous
to this country, this planet?

00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: We don't know.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're dealing
with 11,500 years ago.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
because we don't

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
have enough evidence of the
animal remains to tell us

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
exactly what species
are being depicted

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and whether those species
were actually local.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:19.450 align:middle line:84%
But you've got everything
there from huge great bulls,

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
which are known as Aurochs,
which existed at that time.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:84%
You've got snakes,
lots of boars.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
You've got many
different types of birds,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
including the vulture,
the crane, what

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:84%
appear to be geese,
and possibly even

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:84%
a form of the dodo,
an extinct bird.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.655 align:middle line:84%
You've got insects
like ants and spiders.

00:16:39.655 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They would
make little ants?

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.055 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, yeah, huge,
yeah, big representations.

00:16:44.055 --> 00:16:44.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:16:44.855 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: You've got scorpions.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And all I can say is
that these creatures,

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:84%
most of them you don't want to
be in a small room locked up

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Because
they're going to bite.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:54.100 align:middle line:90%
They're going to gore.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:90%
They're going to kill.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
going to get you.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.063 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And I suppose,
in some ways, that

00:16:58.063 --> 00:17:00.336 align:middle line:84%
is part of the
mentality of the hunter,

00:17:00.336 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
be on your guard

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.104 align:middle line:84%
even when doing these
rituals and ceremonies.

00:17:06.104 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
start questioning,

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why did they
build this place?

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.339 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why did they build--

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.403 align:middle line:84%
why did all these people get
together to construct this?

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who planned it?

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.329 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you
imagine the meeting

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:84%
before they started
building this thing?

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What they
would talk about?

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Somebody had to conceive it--

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.011 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Well, exactly.

00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and say, hey, let's
do this for this purpose.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:90%
What was the purpose?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, there
is almost no evidence

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
of similar type of
stone structures

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:90%
existing prior to this time.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anywhere.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: No, no.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
a few candidates,

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:90%
which maybe we can talk about.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But this is the only
official stone structures

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
or monumental architecture
that existed in this age.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.927 align:middle line:84%
And if it was part of what you
might call a lost civilization,

00:17:54.927 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:84%
you have to start asking,
what does the word

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:90%
"civilization" actually mean?

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, it means
a social order, really,

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:84%
a civilized lifestyle
that involves

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:84%
certain types of
day-to-day function,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
but also it includes
the use of writing.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of the these you
have at Gobekli Tepe,

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:84%
because very clearly
there was some kind

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
of hierarchical structure
to what was going on.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:30.450 align:middle line:84%
There was what we'd call a power
elite behind the motivating,

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:84%
of the bringing together
of these hunter-gatherers

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:90%
to create monuments like this.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
You have, obviously, people
carving and quarrying

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and managing and whatever.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they must
have had hundreds of workers.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.006 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:46.006 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:10%
But beyond that, you
also have the writing,

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:10%
because on various of the stones
are what we call ideograms

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:10%
or even you might
call hieroglyphs,

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:10%
which are mysterious.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:10%
I mean, like the
letter H appears,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:10%
the letter C, and
various other symbols

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:10%
that crop up again and
again that obviously

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.654 align:middle line:10%
have some kind of meaning,
probably, and sound.

00:19:10.654 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they haven't
been deciphered yet.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: No.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, clearly
researchers like myself

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
have ideas about what they
mean, but there is no textbook

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:84%
that we can look at and
say, yes, it means that yet.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So there was some
kind of power elite.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.346 align:middle line:84%
So we have to ask
ourselves, who were they?

00:19:30.346 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And my best guess
at the moment is

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:84%
that they came in from the
North, probably across--

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.490 align:middle line:84%
between the two great
seas in that region,

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the Black Sea
and the Caspian Sea.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.953 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Between
those two is what's

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:51.870 align:middle line:84%
known as the Caucasus,
or Caucasian Mountains,

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and these are an impenetrable
barrier, basically.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:90%
You have to go around them.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
But beyond them is what's
known as the Russian steppe.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is
good evidence of high culture

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.384 align:middle line:84%
existing prior to this
time in that area.

00:20:08.384 --> 00:20:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In that area.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: And that
peoples from up there

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle line:10%
came down via the Caucasus
into what we know now as Turkey

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:10%
and took over,
took over the show,

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:10%
and they brought
together the people.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:10%
But why create
monuments like this?

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think we have to start
looking at the time frame,

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.550 align:middle line:10%
because it wasn't simply a case
of the end of the last Ice Age.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:37.365 align:middle line:84%
But the world had undergone a
terrible cataclysm just prior

00:20:37.365 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to this time, which we now
know as the Younger Dryas comet

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:90%
impact event.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well,
around 10,800 BC,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:84%
it would seem as if a comet
entered the inner solar system,

00:20:54.930 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
fragmented, sending literally
hundreds of thousands of pieces

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
on a direct trajectory
towards the Earth.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we know it
doesn't take a big one

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:90%
to cause all kinds of havoc.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem as if the
worst hit was North America,

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and it left behind literally
hundreds of thousands

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
of craters, which we know
today as the Carolina Bays.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And these are
elliptical-oriented craters

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:28.862 align:middle line:84%
that stretch from New York State
all the way down to Florida,

00:21:28.862 --> 00:21:30.195 align:middle line:90%
with the biggest concentration--

00:21:30.195 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If it happened today--

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.398 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --around
today North Carolina.

00:21:32.398 --> 00:21:34.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --it would be an
earth-shattering killer,

00:21:34.482 --> 00:21:35.281 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't it?

00:21:35.281 --> 00:21:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: It would, and
it created wildfires.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It created what we would
call today a nuclear winter,

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
blocking out the sun for
a long period of time.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It melted large
parts of the ice,

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:84%
because fragments
hit the ice sheets.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And this was not something that
lasted just for a few days.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It lasted for hundreds of years,
I mean, the aftermath of it.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And it triggered a
mini-ice age, which

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
we call the Younger
Dryas, and it actually

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:90%
ended around 9,600 BC.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.020 align:middle line:84%
That's probably around
the time that Gobekli Tepe

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:90%
started to be built.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are various symbols
at Gobekli Tepe, various stones,

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:84%
that suggest to
us comet imagery,

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:24.060 align:middle line:84%
as if these people were
constructing these monuments

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:30.972 align:middle line:84%
not simply as a reminder of
what was going on, but almost

00:22:30.972 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:84%
as a portal or gateway to allow
access from the physical world

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
to the other world, what
we might call the sky

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
world or the upper
world, to deal

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.900 align:middle line:84%
with the supernatural
creatures or divine beings

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was that they saw
as responsible for cataclysm.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:10%
Because it looks as if the
people were still in fear

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:10%
that cataclysms like
this would occur again,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:10%
and this time the
world would end.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.380 align:middle line:10%
And the visionary
writer Barbara Hand Clow

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:10%
described this state of
fear as "catastrophobia,"

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.862 align:middle line:10%
and she actually wrote
a book under that title.

00:23:09.862 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She did, yeah.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And I think it's
a wonderful name for it,

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.270 align:middle line:84%
because these
people, at the time,

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.677 align:middle line:84%
had no psychologists,
no psychoanalysts.

00:23:17.677 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't go to
him and say, look,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I've got a bit of a problem
that I need you to sort out.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:84%
The only people around at that
time were probably shamans.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think what happened
is that the shaman listened

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
to the people and
said, look, no problem.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
We can sort it out for you,
but you have to do what we say,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and part of that
involves the creation

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:84%
of these incredible
stone monuments.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.792 align:middle line:84%
And what we will do is we
will work on your behalf.

00:23:44.792 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:90%
We will do the rituals.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
We will counteract the
supernatural forces

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and ensure that they don't
create any further cataclysms.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And the
people said, oh, OK,

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:90%
because they believed them.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is what happened.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But as the years went
by, the centuries

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:84%
rolled by, as no
further cataclysms

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.549 align:middle line:84%
took place, the meaning of
Gobekli Tepe got less and less.

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So they were just going
through the motions at the end,

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
until eventually they thought,
what are we doing here?

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.050 align:middle line:90%
We might as well just move on.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
exactly what happened.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But this connection
with the sky world

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:84%
is actually very, very
potent, because it wasn't just

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:90%
any old place that they went.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:84%
It would seem as if they
had a specific location

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
or a specific doorway that they
would cross between this world

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:30.470 align:middle line:90%
into the next.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.034 align:middle line:84%
And that is where I come in
with the book, "The Cygnus Key."

00:24:34.034 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did
a great job, too.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Our dear friend Erich von
Daniken has his own thoughts,

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
tying in Abraham from
the Old Testament

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:90%
and this entire region.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.203 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:24:47.203 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VON DANIKEN: Gobekli
Tepe is in Turkey today.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And Gobekli Tepe is, again, one
of the very, very old places

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:90%
dated at least 11,000 BC.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have no reason why
somebody made some stone

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:90%
structures in Gobekli Tepe.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
I have a speculation why.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Because today Gobekli
Tepe is very near.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It's about 10 kilometers
away from the place

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
where our progenitor,
Abraham, was living.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And Abraham, again, was writing
about extraterrestrials.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:84%
There is an old text called
the Abraham apocryphic.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And there Abraham-- he says he
was sitting outside his tent,

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.120 align:middle line:84%
then he heard a
noise in the sky.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:10%
Some beings descended
from the sky,

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:10%
and he clearly say
they were not human.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Erich
definitely believes

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.736 align:middle line:84%
there was an extraterrestrial
presence at that time.

00:25:44.736 --> 00:25:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, with
his extraterrestrial,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I would say celestial,
which is probably the same,

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%
I should think.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the
builders of Gobekli Tepe

00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
had an integral
connection with the stars.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And that connection meant that
they used these enclosures,

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:84%
almost like stargates,
if you like.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.450 align:middle line:84%
The huge, great, twin
monoliths in the center,

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:84%
acting as like
portals or guidance.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the place of shaman

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
would actually
stand between them,

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
enter into an altered
state of consciousness,

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and project their minds into
this otherworldly environment

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:84%
where they would meet the sky
beings, the celestial gods,

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want
to see them as.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And they had a function.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And that function was to ensure
that the world did not undergo

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:90%
anymore of the cataclysms.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.890 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, this was
one of the primary purposes

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:90%
for building Gobekli Tepe.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But by doing this,
it also reveals

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to us very clearly
what parts of the sky

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:90%
that they were interested in.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Because all of
these twin monoliths

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:84%
seem to be focused towards one
particular star of the sky.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is Deneb,
the brightest star

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:90%
in the constellation of Cygnus.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like that about a
system where ETs came from?

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.580 align:middle line:90%
And they told them about that?

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: ETs.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:84%
All around the world,
we find that there

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.610 align:middle line:84%
are monuments from
the Pyramids of Giza,

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.250 align:middle line:84%
to Native American
mound complexes,

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:26.530 align:middle line:84%
to Hindu temples in the
Indian subcontinent,

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:90%
to stone circles in Hawaii.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
All the way around the world,
we have ancient monuments

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.454 align:middle line:84%
focused to this very
same star in the sky.

00:27:35.454 --> 00:27:36.370 align:middle line:90%
So it must have been--

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --very,
very important to us.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have to start asking,
why this area of the sky?

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there are
probably multiple answers,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:84%
but one of them is the fact
that it is very clearly placed

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:90%
on the Milky Way.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:84%
The Milky Way was seen in
the past as a road or river

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:84%
to the sky world, because
it linked to the horizon

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:90%
at specific times--

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.320 align:middle line:90%
the solstices and the equinoxes.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was believed that
the soul, whether it

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:84%
be of the deceased on death,
or indeed, that of the shaman,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:90%
could journey to the horizon--

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:84%
specific points, generally
at the winter solstice.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And they would then rise
up in a symbolic manner

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and enter into the sky world
via this particular star,

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.800 align:middle line:84%
then up into the
constellation of Cygnus,

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:90%
so that's one reason.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Also, there have been
some great discoveries

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:90%
in the area of Cygnus.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know that it's
one of the only sources

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:90%
of cosmic rays.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And cosmic rays are
important to us,

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:49.720 align:middle line:84%
because they affect
mutations in human evolution.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And that it may well be that
these cosmic rays coming

00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.340 align:middle line:84%
from Cygnus have created
the way that we are today.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:10%
But beyond that,
there is something

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:10%
that's been discovered
only in the past few years

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:10%
by astronomers, which is
taking the headlines in science

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:10%
at this moment, and it's
quite an extraordinary story.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:10%
And it's that of Tabby's
Star, a star that also has

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:10%
the low number of KIC 8462852.

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:10%
And this is what they call today
the alien megastructure star,

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:32.070 align:middle line:10%
because a satellite
by the name of Kepler

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:37.471 align:middle line:10%
went up in 2009, looking
for Earth-like planets.

00:29:37.471 --> 00:29:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
found many so far.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: They found
thousands of them.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But they also discovered
something else unique,

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and this was a star,
which was dipping

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:90%
the light that we were seeing.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:84%
In other words, something
was going in front of it

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.060 align:middle line:84%
in a very, very
irregular fashion.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Its light was dipping
by anything up to 15%

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:90%
at one point, 22% on another.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:84%
On many other
occasions, 5, 2%, 1%,

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.210 align:middle line:84%
whatever, in a manner
which was so strange

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.400 align:middle line:84%
the astronomers had never seen
anything like this before.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:18.390 align:middle line:10%
And an astronomer by the
name of Tabetha Boyajian

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.430 align:middle line:10%
was given the job
of-- try to sort out

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.540 align:middle line:10%
what was going on up there.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:27.140 align:middle line:10%
And she wrote a paper suggesting
it was lots of comets.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a
lot of objections,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.420 align:middle line:84%
saying that you'd need
something like 648,000 comets

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.200 align:middle line:84%
to actually create
this type of dips.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
theories going around.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:84%
But the most exciting
is that what's going on

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:47.100 align:middle line:84%
is artificial and could be some
kind of alien megastructure,

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:84%
or even more than one, that are
in orbit around the star that

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.270 align:middle line:84%
would give exactly
this type of signature.

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.210 align:middle line:90%
But what's even more--

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --weird is that these
dips in light have certain--

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.370 align:middle line:90%
what we call periodicities.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be giving
out mathematical patterns that

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:12.450 align:middle line:84%
are very specifically
multiples of the rotation

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:90%
of the star itself.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And they are all
in sequences of 11,

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and that all of
these periodicities

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.202 align:middle line:84%
are also integrally
bound with Earth days.

00:31:22.202 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they synchronize
perfectly with Earth days.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.770 align:middle line:84%
What are the odds of
that just happening?

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Well--

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.932 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Astronomical.

00:31:30.932 --> 00:31:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: --of course.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, there are
three possibilities.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:84%
One is that this is some kind
of weird, natural process that

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.410 align:middle line:84%
goes on in the
universe that we--

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Possible.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.242 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --don't
quite understand.

00:31:40.242 --> 00:31:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Two, that the star is in some
way sentient or intelligent,

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.160 align:middle line:90%
and it's doing it itself.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Or three, that it's
extraterrestrial.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:49.570 align:middle line:90%
That there is--

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.737 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All great theories.

00:31:50.737 --> 00:31:51.536 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --and all of
them we're thinking about,

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:84%
because these
mathematical patterns

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.440 align:middle line:90%
don't seem to be going away.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.040 align:middle line:84%
The star is still
doing these dips, even

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.450 align:middle line:90%
within the past month or so.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's giving these
mathematical patterns.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, many astronomers predicted
that one of the first pieces

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:90%
of evidence of first contact--

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.730 align:middle line:84%
even Carl Sagan, for instance,
in his book "Contact,"

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:20.090 align:middle line:84%
said that we would
find them sending us

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.430 align:middle line:84%
mathematical information
like prime numbers,

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.474 align:middle line:90%
prime number sequences.

00:32:24.474 --> 00:32:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Many people remember
the film "Contact."

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a code, almost.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, which is
exactly what's happening.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And these numbers are not simply
just multiples of nothingness.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.880 align:middle line:10%
They relate specifically
to mathematical formula,

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.970 align:middle line:10%
particularly something
called Pascal's triangle,

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:10%
which is something that's
used within mathematics,

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:10%
to solve all sorts
of weird problems,

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.400 align:middle line:10%
also to generate the
Fibonacci sequence of numbers.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.820 align:middle line:10%
And it also gives us
all of the mathematics

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:10%
for higher-dimensional geometry.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And the number sequences that
have been broadcast by the star

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.000 align:middle line:84%
relate to row 11 of
Pascal's triangle, which

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.986 align:middle line:84%
is all to do with the 11th
dimension, or 11 dimensions.

00:33:09.986 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
this is the number

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.720 align:middle line:84%
of dimensions in
superstring theory,

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.920 align:middle line:84%
or so-called
M-theory, which is all

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.740 align:middle line:84%
about the strings on
a subatomic level.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything is like these
tiny little strings.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:90%
What's the chances of that?

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
But, what would the
purpose be to do all this?

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Are they sending us a message?

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Is that a system of how they
travel throughout space?

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.140 align:middle line:90%
What could it be?

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.105 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: All of it and more.

00:33:42.105 --> 00:33:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to start
looking at places like Gobekli

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Tepe and say, did the
ancients know something

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that we're only
rediscovering now today?

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if that's
true, how can that

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:58.220 align:middle line:84%
be without the knowledge of
the extraterrestrial presence?

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Well, exactly.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It also seems to tie into the
construction of the pyramids.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't everything done
around the same time period?

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, OK, let's look
at Tabby's Star for a moment.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Tabby's Star is 1,300
light years away.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is what we're seeing

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.030 align:middle line:90%
is already 1,300 years out.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.247 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:22.247 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It could have burned out by now.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: It could have done.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.370 align:middle line:90%
It could have.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.190 align:middle line:84%
It's unlikely, but
it could have done.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:32.416 align:middle line:84%
So you have to say, well, what
use is this information to us?

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:35.040 align:middle line:84%
If we send back a message, they
could have destroyed themselves

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.880 align:middle line:90%
by now.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, we need
to see beyond this.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:44.219 align:middle line:84%
Because the speed of light
is the maximum in theory

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.920 align:middle line:84%
you can travel as far
as speed is concerned.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're unlikely to
achieve that anytime soon.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.679 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the universe itself

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.980 align:middle line:84%
would have built in a
much more immediate means

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.260 align:middle line:90%
of communication.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is probably
quantum entanglement.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:06.825 align:middle line:84%
And that's the idea that
old particles are conjoined.

00:35:06.825 --> 00:35:08.540 align:middle line:90%
They have twins.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you see the
misease of infinite amount

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of subatomic particles existing
everywhere all the time, some

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.680 align:middle line:84%
of the ones that are my
head, or in your head,

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.330 align:middle line:84%
or in everybody
else's head, that this

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:25.140 align:middle line:84%
is the answer to everything from
telepathy to even precognition.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Because entanglement works
outside of normal time.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the
case, and there is

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:39.810 align:middle line:84%
no time, then if there is ETI
in connection with this star,

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.330 align:middle line:84%
or even if it's the star
itself that's intelligent,

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.750 align:middle line:84%
we should be able to
communicate with it instantly.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:84%
We should be able to just use
mental sympathy, meditation,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.290 align:middle line:84%
or whatever other
process you might

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:84%
want, to actually
send a message that's

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.060 align:middle line:84%
instantaneous to this
star, and perhaps

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:02.310 align:middle line:84%
even to receive an
instantaneous reply.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:03.580 align:middle line:90%
And how could that happen?

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is something
I've actually been

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:90%
trying to do experimentation.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Earlier this year
was the conference,

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.040 align:middle line:84%
CONTACT in the DESERT, in
California, which I know--

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was out there.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: --that you were at--

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We were there.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.876 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: --yourself.

00:36:15.876 --> 00:36:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
did a experiment.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.800 align:middle line:84%
We tried to communicate with
Tabby's Star in meditation.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And that very day it
responded with the first dip

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:90%
that occurred.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And astronomers
found, right?

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:32.654 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:36:32.654 --> 00:36:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, OK, everybody's going to
say, well, that was probably

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:35.870 align:middle line:90%
just a coincidence.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
believe in coincidences.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.266 align:middle line:84%
I think everything
happens for a reason.

00:36:40.266 --> 00:36:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Exactly.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we just
did it on that date,

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.960 align:middle line:90%
because it felt right to do it--

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.650 align:middle line:84%
because-- that it
was going to occur.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:49.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-way process.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.792 align:middle line:84%
It's like chicken and
the egg, but it worked,

00:36:52.792 --> 00:36:54.000 align:middle line:90%
and I've tried it since that.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: But I don't
think you can try it

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.798 align:middle line:84%
every day, because I just
don't think it will happen.

00:36:57.798 --> 00:37:01.604 align:middle line:84%
But this told me that we
might be on to something here.

00:37:01.604 --> 00:37:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if
our friends at SETI

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.820 align:middle line:84%
searched for extraterrestrial
intelligence-- have

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:10.040 align:middle line:84%
beamed their radio telescopes
that way-- their listening

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:10.840 align:middle line:90%
devices.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.923 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: They have done.

00:37:11.923 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:84%
But the trouble is that's such
a narrow band of frequencies,

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that if you don't
get a response,

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and you come away and say,
we tried, we got nothing,

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.230 align:middle line:84%
we're going to give up,
then I think that that's

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.690 align:middle line:90%
very narrow-minded in a way.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I think you've got to look
at this in a much more

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.010 align:middle line:90%
broad-minded--

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.370 align:middle line:84%
since the discovery
of Tabby's Star,

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:39.420 align:middle line:84%
virtually every large telescope
in the world and off-world

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.980 align:middle line:90%
have been looking at that star.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're all
fascinated by it, aren't they?

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: You could have--

just that, but there are

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh, today, yeah,
it's dipping down.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:90%
It's going back up again.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like hearing the weather.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, when have you
known a star that's

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:90%
had the same type of treatment?

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Never.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, think of all the
human minds that are now

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:90%
connected with that star.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the
star can respond to that?

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:11.160 align:middle line:84%
We know that on
a subatomic level

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:16.710 align:middle line:84%
that observation can affect
the course of an experiment.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:19.080 align:middle line:84%
If you don't look at
it, you get one result.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.900 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it, you
get a different result.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.920 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that
consciousness somehow interacts

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.360 align:middle line:90%
with a subatomic world.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.254 align:middle line:90%
Well, what--

00:38:28.254 --> 00:38:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
know that happens.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:31.128 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --that
is the microcosm.

00:38:31.128 --> 00:38:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And the macrocosm is the
observation of stars.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.880 align:middle line:84%
What if our observation of them
can affect them, and change

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.259 align:middle line:90%
them, maybe even update them?

00:38:41.259 --> 00:38:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there
is that possibility,

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and we need to start
thinking this way.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
You talked earlier
about what-- if there is

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.760 align:middle line:90%
a message, what does it mean?

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Why would they give us
mathematical patterns?

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that it's a part
of the next step of evolution.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Once we understand
that there are messages

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:04.640 align:middle line:84%
to be had in this
manner, I think

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that we will be able to
advance our own understanding

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.950 align:middle line:84%
of technology and our
interaction with not just

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial intelligences,
but the universe as a whole.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.146 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend Erich von
Daniken is hot on the trail

00:39:20.146 --> 00:39:21.020 align:middle line:90%
like you are, Andrew.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.940 align:middle line:90%


00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VON DANIKEN: Humans some
thousands of years ago--

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.830 align:middle line:84%
they were taught by
extraterrestrials.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And the extraterrestrials
told them, please

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.890 align:middle line:84%
make this monument
astronomically.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Most of the dolmen in French
Brittany, for example--

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.949 align:middle line:84%
they are all orientated
astronomically.

00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
they saw the world.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:45.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just the tombstones, so
they tried to find some graves.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:90%
They found nothing.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Then a few years ago
for the first time,

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.960 align:middle line:84%
a helicopter overflew
this megalithic place

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.280 align:middle line:90%
in French Brittany.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And later they realized that
all these stone lines were not

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.430 align:middle line:90%
standing there by coincidence.

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.830 align:middle line:84%
They always measured
the same distance--

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:84%
2,860 meters, or
exactly half of it.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.420 align:middle line:10%
It turns out that
all of it's composed

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.190 align:middle line:10%
of different triangles--

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.990 align:middle line:10%
but Pythagorean triangle.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, Pythagoras was a
Greek mathematician.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.730 align:middle line:84%
He was living in Greece
roughly 4, 500 BC.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But all these stones
in French Brittany

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.070 align:middle line:84%
are at least 5,000
years old, so Pythagoras

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:33.120 align:middle line:84%
had nothing to do with it,
or its link with astronomy.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Here we came to the question.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Of course, our
ancestors had no idea

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.620 align:middle line:90%
of the Pythagorean triangle.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.834 align:middle line:90%
Why have they done it?

00:40:41.834 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He gets excited with
the mathematics behind this.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And this same mathematics
we find at Gobekli Tepe.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:52.120 align:middle line:84%
There is Pythagorean
triangles there as well.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And these are ideas.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, must
have existed right

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.620 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the last Ice Age.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And in "The Cygnus
Key," I bring this out

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and show almost certainly
that it existed,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.280 align:middle line:84%
perhaps even as early as
40 to 45,000 years ago.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
at the very point

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:14.010 align:middle line:84%
of the beginning of our
exploration of the Eurasian

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:90%
continent.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Andrew, why is the
knowledge apparently lost?

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Where's the information
from those who passed it on,

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.690 align:middle line:90%
passed it on?

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So at a point with the
pyramids or Gobekli Tepe,

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.080 align:middle line:84%
somebody would have said,
oh, yes, clearly, they

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.270 align:middle line:90%
made this for this purpose.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:40.440 align:middle line:84%
It was passed down to us
over the thousands of years.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:45.815 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the line
there was a separation,

00:41:45.815 --> 00:41:47.460 align:middle line:90%
and it stopped.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.810 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: It's a difficult
one without any easy answers.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.990 align:middle line:84%
But the way I look at
it is that civilizations

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:84%
are like flowers that gradually
open over a period of hundreds,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.580 align:middle line:90%
if not thousands of years.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, due to
something, probably a cataclysm

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:12.380 align:middle line:90%
of some kind, they then close.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And another one then
opens, maybe a few thousand

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.360 align:middle line:84%
miles away, or even on the
other side of the world.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And that will remain open for a
period of time and then close.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
unfortunately, at such time--

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.450 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of this
information is lost.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And that we have to begin,
just as Plato tells us

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:37.860 align:middle line:84%
in his account of Atlantis,
as children again, literally

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.750 align:middle line:90%
with this amnesia.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is what it's about.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have to relearn it.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:84%
It's important
for us to relearn.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.340 align:middle line:84%
But the more that
we learn, the more

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.182 align:middle line:84%
we realize that the ancients
had this knowledge as well.

00:42:51.182 --> 00:42:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have to
bring in this question

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.790 align:middle line:90%
here as we get close to the end.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:58.066 align:middle line:90%
And that is, why?

00:42:58.066 --> 00:43:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Why is all this happening?

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along
the line, Andrew,

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:05.950 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be that God
factor, because nothing

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:90%
else makes any sense.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, you
could use the word God,

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.930 align:middle line:84%
but you can also use
the word universe.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I like
the term, mind of God.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
the mind of God is

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.420 align:middle line:84%
the sum total of
all consciousness,

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.110 align:middle line:84%
not just of humankind
now, but of humankind

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.950 align:middle line:84%
in the past, and the
future, and possibly even

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:33.430 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of every
living being in the universe.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:36.760 align:middle line:90%
All of that together as one.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.610 align:middle line:90%
And somehow we can access that.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I think that the ancient
Hindus called it the Akasha,

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.520 align:middle line:84%
like the store of old
information or knowledge.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.460 align:middle line:10%
And I think that we all
have access to that,

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.290 align:middle line:10%
whether it's being
in the modern day,

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:55.190 align:middle line:10%
or the ancients had it as well.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:10%
And that you achieve a certain
state of not just evolution,

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:04.040 align:middle line:10%
but a state of mind as well.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And that you can draw that
knowledge down, utilize it,

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:12.792 align:middle line:84%
and pass it to the general
public, the world as a whole.

00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:14.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we are doing.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.080 align:middle line:10%
And I think that as
people like myself,

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:10%
and yourself, and
the viewers themself

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.267 align:middle line:10%
that perhaps this interest are
the ones that are doing this.

00:44:23.267 --> 00:44:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, there's
a passion for it.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Have this passion.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.631 align:middle line:84%
Because there are many
others in this world

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that don't have that
passion and not interested.

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And it is, I think, up to people
like ourselves to bring all

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:38.950 align:middle line:84%
of this knowledge to the
greater, wider world,

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.750 align:middle line:90%
so that we can make use of it.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Because we can only take
it to a certain point.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I can only take this to the
scientists or the astronomers

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, you
take it from here.
