>>GEORGE NOORY: Tell me
about the Alaska Triangle.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.370 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE RICKSECKER: This is about
180,000 square miles of really

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.700 align:middle line:90%
strange and abnormal activity.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it
Alaska's Bermuda Triangle.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:84%
There are these different
areas around the world that

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:90%
have missing airplanes, ships.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:84%
People go missing, UFOs,
paranormal activity.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.365 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's the
electromagnetism of that area.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Of that triangle?

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Yes, absolutely.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
16,000 people have
gone missing in Alaska.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 16,000?

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:10%
Mike Ricksecker is back with
us, a paranormal researcher,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:10%
historian, and author.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.060 align:middle line:10%
His 12th book is about
Alaska's mysterious triangle.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the program.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: George, thank you
so much for having me today.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.755 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 12 books?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: A few, yes.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Good for you.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:90%
How long?

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:90%
How did you get into this?

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.940 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE: Well, writing,
that aspect has always

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:10%
been a part of my life, ever
since I was seven years old.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:10%
I started off writing
little mystery stories,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:10%
really like the "Encyclopedia
Brown" books when I was a kid

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:10%
and tried to mimic those.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And I also wrote some paranormal
ghost stories, things like that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:10%
But the esoteric research
that I'm doing these days

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:10%
was really inspired around 1993
frame when the Robert Schoch

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.090 align:middle line:10%
and John Anthony West
presentation came out

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:10%
with Charlton Heston on "The
Mysteries of the Sphinx."

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
That was absolutely
fascinating to me.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And that became a
whole rabbit hole

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.083 align:middle line:90%
that I started diving down into.

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Captured
your attention.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Absolutely.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.502 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, tell me
about the Alaska Triangle.

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:46.302 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:01:46.302 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, the Alaska
Triangle in Alaska,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
specifically from
Juneau to Anchorage up

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
to Utqiagvik which,
formerly known as Barrow.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
They renamed it to
the original Inuit.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is about 180,000
square miles of land

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that has really strange
and abnormal activity.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's a lot of land.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.315 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: It really is.

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge area.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
We relate it to the
Bermuda Triangle.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it
Alaska's Bermuda Triangle.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But there are these
different areas

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
around the world that have
this strange activity-- missing

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:84%
airplanes, ships,
people go missing,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:90%
UFOs, paranormal activity.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's the dragon
triangle out in Japan.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
There's Bridgewater in
Massachusetts, the Lake

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:90%
Michigan triangle.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So they're really
all over the world.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Alaska is a really anomalous
one and very, very large.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did you
become aware of this?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, I spent
three years in Alaska

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
when I was a member of the
US Air Force, my first duty

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:90%
station.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Thank you for serving.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Thank you.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate that,
1992 and 1995.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And I really wasn't aware
of this unusual activity

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:90%
when I first went up there.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.793 align:middle line:84%
As a young airman it was
just getting my feet wet.

00:02:54.793 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who would
expect you to?

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.168 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Right, exactly.

00:02:57.168 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But when I first
stepped off the plane,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:90%
it was just a whole other world.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.805 align:middle line:90%
This was November 1, 1992.

00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's already
snow on the ground.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But also mixed in there was
ash falling from the sky

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:84%
from a recent volcano eruption,
Mount Spurr across the Cook

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.385 align:middle line:90%
Inlet.

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:84%
A couple of months
later, there's

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
a pretty large earthquake,
6.8 on the Richter scale.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is very volatile land.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And then that April, there
was a plane taking off

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:84%
from the Anchorage airport
in which the engine just

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
fell right off the plane into
a supermarket parking lot.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That
doesn't happen often.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.272 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: No, no, not at all.

00:03:31.272 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately nobody was hurt,
if you can believe that.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You're kidding me.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: No.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.285 align:middle line:84%
It fell into the backside
of the parking lot.

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:39.433 align:middle line:84%
Shrapnel rained down into
apartments that were nearby.

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
People were walking
into their bedrooms,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:90%
finding shrapnel on the floor.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Nobody was hurt.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It just disintegrated.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Yeah.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What caused that?

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, I believe it's the
electromagnetism of that area.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.685 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Of that triangle?

00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about vortex energy
and these different portals

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.140 align:middle line:84%
that are spun off,
this is magnetic energy

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that's welling up
from the Earth's core.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And as it passes through
different metals and minerals,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
it creates different
reaction, creates

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:90%
different magnetic fields.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is a study by the
US Department of the Interior

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:84%
in 1965, in which just covering
about 100,000 square miles

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:90%
of Alaska, and this is--

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Alaska is over
600,000 square miles.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.333 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't able
to get to it all.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
But just in this sixth of
the state that they studied

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
they found what they called five
distinct magnetic characters.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And some of these they
called magnetic anomalies.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And people report
strange compass readings.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
They have problems with
navigation and guidance.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:90%
It was a very volatile area.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.012 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Anomalies everywhere.

00:04:38.012 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Absolutely.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Has anybody
tried to research this area

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:90%
besides someone like you?

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, has science tried
to do anything about this?

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, aside from
those magnetic readings that

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
the Department of
the Interior made--

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and this is back in the
'60s, almost 50 years ago--

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:84%
there really hasn't been that
type of research up there.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And I really wish somebody
would go ahead and do

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
so so we can put more
science behind what

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:90%
we are experiencing up there.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: One of our
guests, Freddy Silva,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:84%
was on "Open Minds," one
of our fine Gaia shows.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke of what we
call energetic hotspots

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and how they generate
strange activity.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Arunachala
is one of the original navels

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's in Tamil culture in all
of their sacred texts and they

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:84%
describe it as a place of the
first occasion in Indian terms,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
where just before the major
catastrophe happened when India

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:84%
did lose a huge amount
of its landmass--

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and this is validated--

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
the god, Siva, addresses the
people in the temple and says,

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
we need to take the knowledge.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We need to hide it in
the hill of Arunachala,

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:84%
where a lingam will
represent my effulgent power.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
there is there today

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
a lingam stone, a
very phallic stone,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.082 align:middle line:84%
which marks the navel
of the Earth, where

00:05:52.082 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:90%
the actual repository--

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: And
in the temple down below,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:84%
same thing, and
ceremonies each day.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: And that's where the
effluent energy of the god,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Siva, the creator
god, actually resides.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's from there if you
take some very highly-sensitive

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
equipment that you will
find it's highly magnetized.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about the location

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of all of these standing stones,
these navels of the Earth,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
where the laws of
physics are slightly

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
different from the
landscape around you.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that
those slight differences

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.197 align:middle line:84%
are those that interfere with
your brainwave patterns, which

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:84%
is why you start getting
to these shamanic states.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: And where do you
get your knowledge from.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Do you agree with him?

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Absolutely.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I love Freddy's work
on this subject.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a
chance to talk to him

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:90%
a couple of times about this.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He's a genius.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Oh, absolutely.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, his book, "The
Divine Blueprint,"

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:90%
I highly recommend it.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And what he's
talking about there

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
are the telluric currents of
the Earth, what people commonly

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:90%
referred to as ley lines.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And where they cross you
have the conductivity

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.208 align:middle line:90%
discontinuities.

00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you have
these really happening spots.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And more things, like portals
or missing airplanes and things

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
like that, are happening
more in these areas.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients knew
to build the stone

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
circles, the pyramids, things
like this on these locations.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing about Alaska

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
is that it's so far
up north and so remote

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.023 align:middle line:84%
that you really don't find those
types of temples and things

00:07:12.023 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
like that up there,
unless they're

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
buried under the ice,
which is totally possible.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But it still has a very
similar type of activity.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And the Native Alaskan
shamans, the Inuit elders

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.355 align:middle line:84%
will talk about this
type of activity.

00:07:25.355 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
They just don't have the
standing stones and things

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Strange activity,
indeed, out there.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Absolutely.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you think this
is paranormal or natural?

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, it's an
interesting question,

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
because I believe in
the school of thought

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that we use the
term "supernatural,"

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:84%
but it's all actually
very natural.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
we don't experience

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:84%
as often, which is why we
use the term "paranormal."

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
There is certainly
paranormal activity

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:90%
that happens in this area.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.708 align:middle line:84%
And it may be quite
more active up there.

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We've got a
couple of photographs

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look at and tell
us what we're seeing here.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is this?

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: This is
Flattop Mountain.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago, I was in
this area doing some research

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:90%
for another television show.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And we were up there with some
electromagnetic field meters.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:90%
We had dowsing rods.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:90%
You had it all.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Absolutely.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And we did find possibly one
of these telluric currents

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:84%
using the dowsing rods,
basically pointing

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
from the top of Flattop
Mountain all the way down

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:90%
into the Anchorage area.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It does
not look unusual.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like any of
these strange occurrences

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:84%
could happen on
something like this.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yes, it
looks very innocent.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And people go hiking through
this area all the time,

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
yet you hear these
stories of people

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
just on a hiking trail like
this suddenly going missing.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.787 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Where did they go?

00:08:47.787 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at our
next still here.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.818 align:middle line:90%
Pretty view.

00:08:51.818 --> 00:08:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.693 align:middle line:84%
And this is the view
down to Anchorage

00:08:54.693 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
from that location
at Flattop Mountain,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:84%
drawing that line straight
down into the city.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the points
of the Alaska Triangle.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, when
you're out there,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
do you have special reading
gauges or anything like that?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:90%
And are they going nuts?

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, we'll have
electromagnetic field meters.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.465 align:middle line:84%
We'll have TriField
meters, these sorts

00:09:15.465 --> 00:09:17.063 align:middle line:84%
of things, and the
old-school methods,

00:09:17.063 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
like the dowels and rods and
maybe a pendulum or something

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:10%
Some people will go out there
with different magnetometers.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of equipment
that you can, of course,

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
bring to these locations and
get these significant readings.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.462 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What other experiments
have you performed out there?

00:09:31.462 --> 00:09:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: I mean, those were
the ones that I performed.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
We only had a very
limited time, but again,

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
very, very significant that I
was able to take those rods,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:90%
cross over this line--

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going back and
forth, attempting

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:90%
to do this several occasions.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And you establish,
this is a spot.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Now can I go up and down the
mountain taking the rods?

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, I'm able
to draw this perfect line.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there reports of
people who go into this area

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:90%
and never come out?

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:84%
David Paulides,
for example, writes

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things about missing
people in our park systems.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:84%
You might be walking
with somebody.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
You turn around
and they're gone.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows where they
are, no scream, nothing.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen out here?

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Oh, absolutely.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Alaska is one of the
more famous locations

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:90%
for this type of activity.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.100 align:middle line:84%
16,000 people have
gone missing in Alaska.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 16,000?

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.275 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Since 1988.

00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Poof, gone.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Just gone.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Just gone.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You give the percentage, because
Alaska is a very sparsely

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:90%
populated state.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It has about the
population of San Francisco

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:90%
in an entire state.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So 16,000 is a very
large percentage

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:90%
of people to go missing.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And they do disappear
right in front of people.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:84%
2012, Mount Marathon
Race, Michael LeMaitre,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
he's a member of the
race, mile and a half up

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
the mountain, right in
public view, goes missing,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:84%
never comes back
down off the mountain

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of a race.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Of these 16,000, Mike,
do they ever find any of them

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:90%
dead?

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, I mean, there
are some natural causes

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:90%
for some of these.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.950 align:middle line:90%
People go out in the woods--

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, absolutely.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: --and they go
missing in the woods.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.307 align:middle line:84%
There are kidnappings,
things like this.

00:11:06.307 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But there are several that
are just never seen or heard

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.460 align:middle line:84%
from again and nobody
knows what happened.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do they
ever come back alive?

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Not usually, no.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Every once in a while, you
hear a case of somebody who

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
they just, they're
with a friend,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:84%
they stepped off the path
because they heard a noise

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.995 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was,
and all of a sudden

00:11:21.995 --> 00:11:23.620 align:middle line:84%
they find themselves
deep in the woods,

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:84%
have no idea how they got
there, can't find their way back

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.010 align:middle line:90%
to the path.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And it might be
a couple of weeks

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
later that they're
finally found.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And their story is I have
no idea how I got there.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But you don't have
anybody who has come back

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh my god, I
walked into another dimension.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get back.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:90%
But I found a hole and came in.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:90%
You don't get that?

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, there is a story
of a young boy a few years back

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:90%
that was found by some hunters.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
They had some snowmobiles
and they were out there

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:84%
on their way to a location that
they were going to go hunt at.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And they saw this boy just stand
there amongst these bushes.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:84%
There's no tracks
leading up to this boy.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And take him in because he's
cold and he's shivering.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And the story that he tells
after they bring him in

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:84%
is that he had been taken
into the nearby mountain

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:90%
by these small people.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And while he was there,
he met this young girl

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
who had been there for
40 years but didn't age.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So time was very
elusive in this area.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason, they
decided to let him go.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.593 align:middle line:84%
And he just emerged
in this location

00:12:27.593 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:90%
where the hunters found him.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's unbelievable.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.938 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, it's
a bizarre story.

00:12:30.938 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And planes
disappear, too?

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: There are quite
a few different stories

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:90%
about missing airplanes.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The most famous would be
the 1972 Airplane that

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
went missing, a small
Cessna plane carrying

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
the House Majority Leader Hale
Boggs, Congressman Nick Begich.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I know Nick
Begich's son, Nick Begich Jr.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Junior, right.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And he talks
about that incredible story.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And they never found the plane?

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: They never found
a thing, no, not at all.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.535 align:middle line:84%
And other planes have
gone down in that area.

00:12:57.535 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And they keep a
lookout, were you

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:90%
ever going to find that plane?

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.532 align:middle line:84%
It was the biggest search
and rescue mission--

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It was huge.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: --yeah, by the United
States to that point in time.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.748 align:middle line:84%
They had spy planes out
there looking for them,

00:13:06.748 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:84%
not a thing ever found,
completely disappeared.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.537 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How could
you not find a plane

00:13:10.537 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:84%
unless something happened
where it just disappeared?

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, and
that's where I think

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:84%
they're disappearing into
some of these portals that

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.060 align:middle line:90%
are spawned up.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Another famous one, 1950,
a Douglas Skymaster,

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.480 align:middle line:84%
huge airplane carrying
44 military personnel.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Day was in January, so
it's a little chilly.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And as they were crossing over
Alaska into the Yukon territory

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
of Canada near the Snag
area they just completely

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.547 align:middle line:84%
disappeared, not a thing
heard from them again.

00:13:36.547 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
A couple of weeks later,
there was a smaller plane

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.797 align:middle line:90%
that went down in that area.

00:13:39.797 --> 00:13:42.110 align:middle line:84%
They were able to find that
one just perfectly fine.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But this huge Douglas
Skymaster, which, again, they

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
had thousands of
people out there

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
looking for some sort
of wreckage that may

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:90%
have gone down, nothing at all.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Nothing.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Yeah.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It is very surprising
that you could not ever

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:90%
find one piece of evidence.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And there were people
trying to give reports of,

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:84%
well, we heard this
over here and we

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:90%
thought we heard an explosion.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And they go out and investigate
and there's nothing there.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Ever any UFO
activity out there?

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, it's
very interesting.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:84%
With that Douglas
Skymaster story,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
a couple of days beforehand
around the Kodiak area,

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
just south of Anchorage, there
was a rather significant UFO

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.478 align:middle line:84%
sighting, which
involved the US Navy.

00:14:28.478 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
There were some bright lights
that were seen in the sky

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:90%
by a Navy patrol pilot.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple
of hours later,

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:84%
the USS Tillamook,
which is a Navy vessel,

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.720 align:middle line:84%
there were several witnesses
aboard that ship that, again,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:84%
saw strange lights, that one
described it as it looked

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:90%
like a red glowing exhaust.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Others described it as like
an orange ball of fire.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for several hours.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And this was just days
before that Douglas Skymaster

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:90%
went missing.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Amazing.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.487 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about the
activity of the sun?

00:14:57.487 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Does that have a
bearing on any of this?

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: It does.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that's something
that people kind of forget

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:90%
and don't really consider.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But the Earth's magnetic shield
around our poles is thinner.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And so when the solar
flares coming from the sun

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
smack into the
Earth's atmosphere,

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:84%
that's where we get
these beautiful auroras.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I saw several up there
when I lived up there.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.115 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's gorgeous.

00:15:20.115 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: It is very,
very beautiful.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But that creates a higher
electromagnetic field.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we hear about the
mass coronal ejections

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:90%
that hit the Earth.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And they can knock out
entire power grids.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.862 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, absolutely.

00:15:33.862 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:84%
We've been a champion
trying to get

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:84%
the grid protected because if
an X-flare hits us, we're toast.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So Alaska is really this
interesting cocktail of energy

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
because you have
the solar flares.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:84%
You have the volcanic
and seismic activity.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Then you have, of course,
the magnetic activity

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that's coming up out
of the ground, too.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have all of these factors
playing into this triangle

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We have
a clip from you

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:84%
about the disappearance
phenomena which is happening

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:90%
in the Alaska Triangle.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE: The Alaska
Triangle is an area

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:10%
of Alaska from Juneau to
Anchorage to Barrow, which

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:10%
is known for strange
disappearances, anomalies,

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:10%
and supernatural activity.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:10%
In any given year,
500 to 2,000 people

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:10%
go missing in Alaska and a
total of 16,000 since 1988.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:10%
Like the Bermuda Triangle,
the Alaska Triangle

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.740 align:middle line:10%
seems to harness the
Earth's energy grid

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:10%
to create a vortex of
mystery and a possible portal

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:10%
into another dimension,
affecting planes, boats,

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:10%
people, and more.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I've appeared on a handful
of episodes of "The Alaska

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Triangle."

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:10%
And the show covered a
number of strange occurrences

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:10%
and disappearances, including
missing airplanes and ships,

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.720 align:middle line:10%
UFO sightings,
paranormal activity,

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:10%
and cryptid sightings.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:10%
The missing Douglas story
is particularly interesting.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:10%
This was a Douglas
C-54D airplane,

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:10%
which took off from Elmendorf
Air Force Base in January 1950

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:10%
and disappeared without a trace.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:10%
The weather called for
mostly clear skies.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:10%
And there was no
reason to suspect

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:10%
anything was wrong with its
final radio contact at 1:09 PM.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
However, at the very edge
of the Alaska Triangle,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:84%
near Snag in Yukon Territory,
Canada, it disappeared.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:84%
No wreckage or survivors
were ever found.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:10%
During the search operation,
cryptic radio messages

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:10%
were received, but it
was difficult to discern

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.569 align:middle line:10%
the message they were
trying to convey.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:10%
Many believe these messages were
from the crew of the missing

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:10%
Douglas C-54D.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:10%
Yet just as quickly as
the transmissions started,

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:10%
they stopped.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:10%
If the plane had slipped into a
portal into another dimension,

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:10%
could those messages have
been transmitting back

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:10%
through the portal,
since sound travels

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:10%
on a different wavelength
then frequency, than light?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:10%
Even when I lived in Alaska
during the early to mid-1990s,

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:10%
crazy activity happened
when an engine fell off

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:10%
an airplane taking off
from the Anchorage airport.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, no one was
hurt, but local citizens

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
were shocked when
the engine crashed

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
into the parking a local
supermarket and the shrapnel

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:90%
fell into people's homes.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.983 align:middle line:10%
And then back over
here in the back

00:18:08.983 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:10%
of the-- fortunately in the
back of the parking lot,

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:10%
no one was hurt.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:10%
That's where the engine fell.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:10%
Of course, the most notorious
Alaska Triangle disappearance

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:10%
is that of the Airplane carrying
US House Majority Leader Hale

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:10%
Boggs, Alaska Congressman Nick
Begich, aide Russell Brown,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:10%
and pilot Don Johns in 1972.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:10%
In an effort that spanned an
area of 325,000 square miles

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:10%
and more than 3,600
hours of search time,

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.542 align:middle line:10%
nothing was ever found.

00:18:38.542 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This is one of the
most incredible stories, Mike,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:84%
I've ever heard,
truly remarkable.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, it's
absolutely fascinating, sad

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
because these people are
never heard from again.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:90%
The families are traumatized.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:50.847 align:middle line:90%
And people want answers.

00:18:50.847 --> 00:18:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Of course.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.308 align:middle line:90%
They're entitled to the answers.

00:18:53.308 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: And I believe so.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can you imagine the
horror, assuming for a moment

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that these people have
fallen into a portal

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.420 align:middle line:90%
and can't get back?

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my god.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.998 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
going through their minds?

00:19:06.998 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, I
mean, the people that

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
go through the portals, I
mean, absolutely shocking.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.102 align:middle line:84%
I've looked at it from
another perspective.

00:19:14.102 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
When they go through
these portals,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.835 align:middle line:90%
where are they arriving?

00:19:16.835 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it in another dimension?

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Is another point in time?

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.135 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Or are they dead?

00:19:20.135 --> 00:19:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Or are they dead, yeah,
that's another question, too.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Do they end up just dying?

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to look at the
possibility of them maybe

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:90%
going to another point in time.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that missing Douglas
Skymaster went back 500 years

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.003 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
portal spit them out,

00:19:37.003 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:84%
because we've seen
that with Bruce Gernon

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:39.140 align:middle line:90%
down in the Bermuda Triangle.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Or into the future.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Yeah, into the future.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Gernon went into the
future a couple of hours.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:10%
So if the Douglas
Skymaster went back,

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:10%
say, 500 years into the
past and the Native Inuit

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:10%
up there see this massive
airplane in the sky,

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:10%
well, they have no context
of an airplane at all.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:90%
So what so they relate it to?

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.117 align:middle line:84%
A giant bird, very
thunderous in nature.

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So is this where some of
these thunderbird legends

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:84%
are coming from, these airplanes
going through a portal back

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.180 align:middle line:84%
in time and the Inuit are
seeing it and coming up

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:90%
with their legends?

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How comparable
is the Alaska Triangle

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:90%
to the Bermuda Triangle?

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: It's right
on par, I believe.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Between the different
disappearances with airplanes,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:84%
you have a lot of
strange things that

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:28.100 align:middle line:84%
happen with ships, of
course, the UFO activity

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:90%
within these areas as well.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:90%
So it's very comparable.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is the activities
out there scary at all?

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, I
mean, you have quite

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:84%
a bit of paranormal
activity up there as well,

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
people reporting
hauntings, ghosts, spirits,

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:90%
these sorts of things.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is that unusual?

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: No, it's
not unusual at all.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I experienced some
things up there

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:52.430 align:middle line:84%
in the Alaska Command Building
that people would probably

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
call shadow beings because
that's what we were seeing.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.818 align:middle line:84%
We were seeing these shadows
in the communications center

00:20:57.818 --> 00:20:59.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Alaska Command
Building, which

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:84%
was in the basement
of this huge building.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's a secure facility.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.700 align:middle line:84%
But in the back offices area
and sometimes out on the floor,

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.200 align:middle line:84%
but usually in the
back offices, we

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:84%
would see these
shadows moving about.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And you would feel a very heavy
energy at that point in time.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:90%
So something would kind of--

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
you'd get like that sensation
of goose bumps on your back,

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:90%
like OK, what's going on here?

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.407 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, you
would see this shadow dart

00:21:27.407 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
between the cubicles
or into the back corner

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And so kind of trying to
discern or figure out, OK,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are legends about
the building perhaps once

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:84%
being a historic hospital
before it was used for command.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I did some historic
research on that.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:90%
It was never a hospital.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:84%
They were saying, trying to
say we were in the morgue.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
just the people trying

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:84%
to really figure
out and determine,

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:90%
what is going on here?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't talk
about it too vocally.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you'd find yourself
down at mental health.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:90%
So this legend was formulated.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But when I did my research
into the building from my book,

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
"Alaska's Mysterious
Triangle," I had discovered,

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.540 align:middle line:84%
no, this was only
ever used for command.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:90%
So what's happening here?

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Why are we seeing these shadows?

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe time is all
concurrent, past, present,

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:90%
future.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are moments
that the energy of an area

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
can somehow sync up to
those moments of time

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:90%
to be on the same frequency.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to for a moment
see those things happening.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So right now it could be syncing
up with a moment from the past.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we see what
we might think is a ghost.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But that ghost could
be looking at us,

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.437 align:middle line:84%
as if we're the ghost or
maybe a shadow person.

00:22:46.437 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We've got
a couple of stills

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look at
and react for us, Mike.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at our first
one, which is a building.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.255 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, this is the
Alaska Command Building where--

00:22:57.255 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: This is the one.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, I spent two of
my three years in Alaska there.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the
basement of this building

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:06.277 align:middle line:84%
where we were seeing
that shadow activity.

00:23:06.277 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, we would kind of talk
about it in whispers-- hey,

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:90%
did you see that?

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
there are actually

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.425 align:middle line:84%
time slips that we may have been
seeing personnel from the past

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:90%
or even from the future.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.497 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
ourselves down there.

00:23:16.497 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Just
hanging around there.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Next still, let's see
what we have here.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.265 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, this is
a young version of me.

00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: How old were you?

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:25.585 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE: I was 19.

00:23:25.585 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Just a kid.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:10%
Air Force?

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE: Air Force, yes.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:10%
I was just a kid.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.698 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Good for you.

00:23:29.698 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE: And so this is on the
floor of the Communications

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Center.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:10%
And you can barely see
it on the other side,

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:10%
but there is a doorway back
there, in which many times

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:10%
we would see those shadows
darting into that room

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.290 align:middle line:10%
back there.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: These shadow entities,
what's your gut tell you?

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, there are a
lot of different theories

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.452 align:middle line:84%
as to what these things
are and who they could be.

00:23:53.452 --> 00:23:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Some people will
try to say they're

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
the darkest of the
dark and very evil.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Some of them.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Are some of them
are up to no good.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Others are benevolent.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Most are just standing,
watching, and observing.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have some that are human
spirits that just can't fully

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:84%
manifest as an apparition
or some sort of ghost.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I think a true shadow
person is some sort

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.050 align:middle line:84%
of interdimensional being
that's crossing over

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:84%
from some other
plane of existence.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Some are extraterrestrials.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Some may even be astral
projections and things

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:23.120 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So they are a variety
of different things.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In your docuseries
called "The Shadow Dimension,"

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.967 align:middle line:84%
you talk about these
interdimensional beings.

00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MARK ANTHONY: In spirit
communicates and in encounters

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.890 align:middle line:10%
with aliens, there's these
abrupt and sudden appearances.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:10%
There's oftentimes accompanied
by flashes of light and also

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.940 align:middle line:10%
a rapid disappearance.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:10%
And this would tend
to indicate coming

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:10%
from one location in
a different dimension,

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:10%
doing a quantum
leap, if you will,

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:10%
that would account for
the flash of light,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:10%
the electromagnetic energy, and
then the rapid disappearance.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:10%
So we very well
may be dealing with

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:09.700 align:middle line:10%
several different entities,
several different species using

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:10%
a similar energetic
modality in order

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:10%
for them to communicate or
to visit what we call Earth.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE: I believe a
true shadow person

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.490 align:middle line:10%
is an interdimensional being.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:10%
And that's what this
research is coming down to.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.200 align:middle line:10%
How can we interact with
other dimensions and beings

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:10%
from other dimensions?

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be
going to locations

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:10%
that are known for
portal activity that

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:10%
have that welling of the
Earth's magnetic core

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:10%
to create that vortex
of energy, that creates

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:10%
these portals and other
supernatural activity in highly

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:10%
concentrated areas like this.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.250 align:middle line:10%
This is why the ancients would
create these sites of power,

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:10%
like Stonehenge and
Karnak, the pyramids,

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:10%
because they knew that this
was a highly energetic spot

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.990 align:middle line:10%
to be able to tap into the
Earth's magnetic field.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I tend to think that these
were interdimensional beings.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:10%
I've heard people
talk about ghosts

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:10%
and spirits, apparitions, and
what their encounters are like.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:10%
And I've even seen a
ghostly figure before.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.860 align:middle line:10%
When I've stayed in
castles in Europe.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.760 align:middle line:10%
I've seen things out of
the corner of my eyes.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:10%
These beings, I would
describe the encounter

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:10%
as much different.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:30.450 align:middle line:10%
There's something about them
that it was like, what is this?

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:10%
Who are they?

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.823 align:middle line:10%
I tend to think they're from
another dimensional space.

00:26:34.823 --> 00:26:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They
might all be right.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.760 align:middle line:84%
The remarkable
researcher, Heidi Hollis,

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:84%
coined the phrase "shadow
people" many, many years ago.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And these beings, whatever they
may be, could be everywhere.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, I mean,
there is another dimension.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:50.980 align:middle line:84%
There's another
world around us--

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Something's out there.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: --that we cannot
see with our own eyes

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
because it's in a
different light spectrum.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.950 align:middle line:90%
But it's all around us.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And there are those
moments, again,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:84%
in which the situation
is just right

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.233 align:middle line:84%
and those two
moments are vibrating

00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:90%
at the same frequency.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're all vibrating.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:90%
We're all energy, resonance.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And those moments are just
right in the frequency that's

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.810 align:middle line:84%
being produced and we
get a glimpse of it.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe many of these
interdimensional beings

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
have figured out how
to harness that energy,

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:84%
how to get themselves
on the same wavelength,

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.950 align:middle line:84%
the right frequency, to be able
to enter into our dimension

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:90%
and watch and observe humanity.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What could be
another reason, Mike,

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:90%
that these disappearances occur?

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:90%
The planes, the people--

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:42.165 align:middle line:84%
could they be keeping them for
some reason, these entities?

00:27:42.165 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, and that
happens with a lot of people.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:84%
We hear stories of
extraterrestrial abductions.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:84%
They could be
interdimensional beings

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that are abducting people
for scientific research

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:90%
in their own realm.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.300 align:middle line:84%
They're probably
curious about humanity.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we would do such a thing
if we went to another planet

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and were going to study the
life that's on that planet.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So that may be what's
happening to us.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, you talked
earlier about other areas

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that could
be similar to the Alaska

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Triangle, the Bermuda Triangle.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:84%
How many are there
that we know of?

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Yeah, there are a lot.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:84%
In some of the
films that I've put

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.945 align:middle line:84%
together I cover a good half
a dozen, several of them

00:28:24.945 --> 00:28:26.070 align:middle line:90%
here in the United States--

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.153 align:middle line:84%
Nevada, Lake Michigan,
the Bridgewater Triangle.

00:28:29.153 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: All similar things,
strange things happen?

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.252 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Similar activity, yeah.

00:28:33.252 --> 00:28:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You had the famous
Northwest flight

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.580 align:middle line:84%
that went missing
over Lake Michigan,

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.700 align:middle line:84%
but also people
disappearing right off

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.488 align:middle line:84%
of boats, ships going down
without any rhyme or reason.

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So you have a lot
of strange activity

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.570 align:middle line:84%
there at Lake Michigan as
well, but similar to what

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:90%
you find in Bermuda and Alaska.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you have
any strange anomalies

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
of creatures and
animals out there,

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.373 align:middle line:84%
like two-headed rabbits
or anything like that?

00:28:57.373 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Well, there
are a number of what

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.830 align:middle line:84%
people call cryptid sightings,
so Bigfoot sightings,

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.360 align:middle line:90%
things like this.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Alaska has the famous Kushtaka,
which is half man, half otter.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And those type of
stories seem very related

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.950 align:middle line:84%
to something like the Wendigo
around the Great Lakes area,

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:20.190 align:middle line:84%
in which people are
lured out into the woods

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:84%
with cries of help and
this sort of thing.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're either
attacked by the Kushtaka

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.820 align:middle line:84%
or they are turned into
a Kushtaka themselves.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We talked earlier
about the possibility

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:90%
of UFO activity.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that still pretty prevalent?

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Oh yeah, there are
certainly many UFO sightings

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.662 align:middle line:84%
out there today, also
USOs, the submerged--

00:29:39.662 --> 00:29:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Submergables.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: --objects, yeah.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.610 align:middle line:84%
We don't really think
about this with Alaska,

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:84%
but there are over 3
million lakes up there

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.610 align:middle line:90%
that are over 20 acres large.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of places for
these sorts of things

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:90%
to be able to hide.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Tell me
about Mount Hayes.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Mount
Hayes, so this is--

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the largest peaks
in Alaska, very, very remote,

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:84%
right really in the middle
of the Alaska Triangle.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And this became rather
famous and noted

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.890 align:middle line:84%
for possible
extraterrestrial activity

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.960 align:middle line:90%
up there through remote viewing.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.700 align:middle line:84%
The famous remote viewer, Pat
Price back in the early 1970s,

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
he had one day on Hal Puthoff's
desk put down a folder

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and said, I think you're going
to find this interesting.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
On his own he had done
some remote viewing

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
of different areas
around the world,

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.060 align:middle line:90%
one of them being Mount Hayes.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And some of his
findings at first

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:90%
seem to be rather innocuous.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's human
activity going on,

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.390 align:middle line:84%
some of the equipment that he
describes first, computers,

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.840 align:middle line:84%
oscilloscopes, some equipment
for weather detection.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.020 align:middle line:90%
That seemed fine.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But when he looked
inside the mountain,

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:51.390 align:middle line:84%
he discovered an open area
where humans, likely military,

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:55.200 align:middle line:84%
were working with these
superhuman type people that may

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:90%
have been extraterrestrials.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.132 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there
hidden ET bases there?

00:31:00.132 --> 00:31:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: A lot of
people believe so.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:90%
This is certainly one of them.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What might they look
like, if you had to speculate?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Some of them, at least
from Pat Price's description,

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.220 align:middle line:84%
many of these seem to
be larger in nature.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, he described them
as more superhuman in nature.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So they had some added
strength, larger in stature,

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.340 align:middle line:84%
a little bit different than
what we think of with some

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.780 align:middle line:90%
of the Grey aliens.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We've talked
about ancient aliens

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.910 align:middle line:90%
before on this program a lot.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Is there a connection
between ancient civilizations

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:90%
and this triangle?

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: I believe so.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
We hear stories about the
black pyramid up there.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is another location
that we have anecdotal stories

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.900 align:middle line:84%
It was actually just before I
was stationed up there in 1992,

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.780 align:middle line:90%
there was a news story that ran.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.270 align:middle line:84%
China was doing some
nuclear testing.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.040 align:middle line:84%
We knew the seismic
waves were going

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:90%
to hit the area from that.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And so geologists had
primed their instruments

00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:90%
to be able to detect this.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:01.740 align:middle line:84%
From their readings
they discovered

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that there was this pyramidal
structure under the mountains

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.100 align:middle line:90%
there near Mount Denali.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And what was very, very
strange about this,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
there was a young individual in
the army at the time stationed

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:84%
at Fort Richardson, Doug
Mutschler, who went down

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:84%
to the station
because he was trying

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:84%
to get family to tune
into another broadcast

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.270 align:middle line:90%
of this story.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could seem to find
this second broadcast of it.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.820 align:middle line:90%
So he went down to the station.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:35.655 align:middle line:84%
And they denied any
knowledge of this report

00:32:35.655 --> 00:32:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that he had actually
seen until--

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But they
knew about it?

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: They knew about it.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:84%
As he was walking out of the
building, very disappointed,

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:84%
there was a young aide that
pulled him aside and said,

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.240 align:middle line:84%
a few hours ago, just
before you showed up,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.665 align:middle line:84%
there were some men that came
and confiscated the tapes.

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:48.465 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:32:48.465 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, so
it's something--

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We hear
this all the time.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, like the
men in black type stories.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:53.445 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All the time.

00:32:53.445 --> 00:32:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Right.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: On Gaia's
"Open Lines,"

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe,
great reporter,

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:01.752 align:middle line:84%
talks about the discovery
of the Alaskan Pyramid.

00:33:01.752 --> 00:33:03.210 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDA MOULTON
HOWE: Now, what did

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:06.300 align:middle line:10%
the father tell the son
that I've interviewed

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.410 align:middle line:10%
that he learned from that
pilot about what in the world

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.260 align:middle line:10%
was there under that
kind of security.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.910 align:middle line:10%


00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:10%
It is a pyramid made out of
stone thousands of years old.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:10%
The maker is unknown and that
we know, meaning our government,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.260 align:middle line:10%
the US government,
has learned that it

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:10%
can give off enough energy to
power the nation of Canada.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, the father tells his
wife and the son about this

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:10%
and says, I promised the
pilot I would never, ever talk

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:10%
to anybody, so don't talk.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.600 align:middle line:10%
That was in 1978.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So now we have '59 to
'61 a Western Electric

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Bell with a military background,
electrical engineer, who

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is working at the
base of a pyramid

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:90%
and tells his son all about it.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:10%
Then you jump from
'59, '61, to 1978,

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:15.510 align:middle line:10%
Unalalkeet out to where
very near Mount McKinley

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.440 align:middle line:10%
and this drama and this
being thousands of years

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.830 align:middle line:10%
old, no one knows who made
it, but the government

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:27.900 align:middle line:10%
knows that it will give off
enough energy to power Canada?

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:34.020 align:middle line:10%
Jump to 1994 November, 40 men
working in the United States

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.770 align:middle line:10%
Army Counterintelligence,
the warrant officer,

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:10%
Doug Mutschler watches--

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:10%
it was in house.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.960 align:middle line:10%
It was in Fort Richardson.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:10%
That's what we are still
trying to figure out.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.110 align:middle line:10%
Was this something that was
not broadcast to the greater

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.580 align:middle line:10%
Anchorage population?

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:10%
Was this a test for
some reason inside

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.870 align:middle line:10%
of Fort Richardson and it
tells about this huge pyramid

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.910 align:middle line:10%
underground and how
scientists found it

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:10%
with the Chinese one
megaton test, which is

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.800 align:middle line:10%
how I came to learn about it?

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There is so much
going on this planet, Mike.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my gosh, even
that example alone--

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.480 align:middle line:90%
where is this happening?

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: It's happening all over.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.410 align:middle line:84%
These are things
that are with us.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter of paying
attention and in observing.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.810 align:middle line:84%
People tend to go about
their daily lives.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.185 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
things going on.

00:35:26.185 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:90%
We're very, very busy people.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.710 align:middle line:84%
If we stop and listen
and watch and observe,

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.740 align:middle line:84%
we'll find a lot of these things
happening around us everywhere.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In the
South Pole there's

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.800 align:middle line:90%
a supposed pyramid down there.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.892 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this.

00:35:41.892 --> 00:35:42.850 align:middle line:90%
It's weird, isn't that?

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: It is.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It looks like an aerial photo
of the Great Pyramid of Giza

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:48.760 align:middle line:90%
with snow all around it.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But this is in the
Ellsworth Range.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, the mainstream
will tell you

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:84%
that this is just a
geological feature.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just a mountain.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.355 align:middle line:84%
But that sure looks
like a pyramid to me.

00:35:58.355 --> 00:36:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there's not
really a way to get out to it.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:01.900 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very remote.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
a satellite photo.

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But we're seeing here
connections all over the world.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Here's a pyramidal
structure in Antarctica,

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.080 align:middle line:90%
which we know is very ancient.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not always
been where it was.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.770 align:middle line:84%
When they've drilled
down to the ice

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:14.978 align:middle line:90%
they have found jungle there.

00:36:14.978 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Could that
be a natural formation?

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: There is a
possibility that it could be.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.190 align:middle line:90%
We can't rule that out.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think we would want
some verification of that.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.508 align:middle line:84%
Can we send a team out there
to go verify whether that is

00:36:28.508 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:90%
a natural feature or a pyramid?

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It looks pretty
desolate, doesn't it, Mike?

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.618 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Oh, absolutely.

00:36:32.618 --> 00:36:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do
you even get to it?

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Right now you don't.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How high up is that?

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.953 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE: I mean, it's
several thousand feet.

00:36:39.953 --> 00:36:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's huge.

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Off the top of
my head I do not recall.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:44.500 align:middle line:90%
But it's huge.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.333 align:middle line:84%
Everything in Antarctica
seems to be bigger.

00:36:46.333 --> 00:36:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The Saint Louis Arch,
you've seen pictures of that.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.118 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: Yeah, I've been here.

00:36:50.118 --> 00:36:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's 600 feet tall.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So this thing is at least
two or three times taller

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.590 align:middle line:90%
than the arch.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.548 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: At least, yeah.

00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's amazing.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, and you think
about this with Antarctica,

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.220 align:middle line:90%
there are miles of ice there.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.235 align:middle line:84%
So how much farther
down does that go?

00:37:05.235 --> 00:37:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I mean,
truly you could

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:11.170 align:middle line:84%
see it looks like
a perfect pyramid.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Yeah, it's
a perfect pyramid.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:84%
How is something
like that natural?

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So is this connected to
the pyramids of Giza?

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it connected to the
black pyramid in Alaska?

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:84%
This is where I think that we
have forgotten history, that

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:32.010 align:middle line:84%
over the course of millennia,
ancient cultures, whether it

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:84%
was some maybe wars broke
out and they were annihilated

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and they forgot their
knowledge, we, of course,

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.870 align:middle line:90%
know the stories of Atlantis.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Is this tied into those
ancient cultures like that?

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.260 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Were you ever scared
being out in that region?

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: In Alaska?

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yes.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Probably
the scariest moment

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.020 align:middle line:90%
that I had was the drive out.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I actually drove out of
Alaska November 1994.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why was
the drive scary?

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: There were
points in time

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.972 align:middle line:84%
where the road, the Alaska
Canadian Highway at that time,

00:38:02.972 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:84%
there are some areas
that were not paved.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're on a dirt road
out in the middle of nowhere,

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.580 align:middle line:90%
all this snow around.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're wondering,
am I still on the road?

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.010 align:middle line:10%
It is very, very
remote and desolate

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.400 align:middle line:10%
in some of those areas.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
what becomes very

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.920 align:middle line:10%
scary, is when you're
all alone and you know

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.150 align:middle line:10%
that for hundreds of miles--

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.360 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Anything could happen.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MIKE: --there's nothing.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:23.263 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Anything could happen.

00:38:23.263 --> 00:38:24.960 align:middle line:84%
How do people get a
hold of you, Mike?

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.915 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE: You can find me my
website, mikericksecker.com.

00:38:27.915 --> 00:38:29.295 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Spell that out for us.

00:38:29.295 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE: Yeah,
M-I-K-E-R-I-C-K-S-E-C-K-E-R.com.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Mike, thanks
for being on the program.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE: Thank you
so much, George.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.498 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:38:37.498 --> 00:38:42.270 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: This anomaly in Alaska
could be all over the planet.
