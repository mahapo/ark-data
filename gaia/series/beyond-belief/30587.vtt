00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.028 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:17.735 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.665 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:35.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>And now, the host of the
nationally syndicated "Coast

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
to Coast AM" and Gaiam TV
bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.932 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:46.015 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are so
many fascinating mysteries

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and
in this universe.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And it takes some
very special people

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to investigate those mysteries,
to try to unravel them,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to try to come up with
answers that affect all of us.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
One of them is an expert in
ancient civilizations, ufology.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Many have called him the
reincarnated Edgar Cayce.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for our
special guest, David Wilcock,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.316 align:middle line:90%
right here on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Davey, my friend.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID WILCOCK: I gave you
a little "Gangnam Style."

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I just might have you
do the "Gangnam Style"

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.982 align:middle line:90%
dance for everybody right here.

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:30.814 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how much
money that guy is making?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.551 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I know,
it's crazy, right?

00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not bad, by the way.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Oh, thank you.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not bad.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: I practiced that.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing well.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's good to see you.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: It's good
to see you, George.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.341 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've known
David for years.

00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:45.399 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I
still owe him a lunch.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: That's right.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.565 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We were at an
event, must have been what?

00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Six, seven years ago?

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.626 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Seven years ago.

00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sat down with David,
producer Tom Dannheiser was

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And all three of us ordered
a nice little lunch.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying, David,
we owe you a lunch.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.955 align:middle line:90%
Somehow, Tom and I forgot.

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:05.262 align:middle line:84%
And we got up and left,
sticking David with the bill.

00:02:05.262 --> 00:02:07.059 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Yeah,
thanks a lot, buddy.

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Lots of things we're
going to talk with David about

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:90%
tonight.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to ask
you this-- the more I

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.705 align:middle line:84%
see you, the more you look
like those Edgar Cayce pictures

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
that I see in your book, "The
Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce?"

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: He always
has to bring this up.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It is uncanny.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.118 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: This
is like mandatory.

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:24.884 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Uncanny.

00:02:24.884 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:90%
But how have you been?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.925 align:middle line:90%
What's new with you, David?

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: I've been good.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I was just on a
three-hour program

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.042 align:middle line:84%
on national television
in Russia, prime time.

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good for you.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: On January
16 from eight to 11 PM,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
totally disclosing all the
deepest secrets of the Federal

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Reserve and basically revealing
for the first time how they

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:84%
systematically confiscated the
world's gold between World War

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.279 align:middle line:90%
I and World War II.

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, did you
have an interpreter there?

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
How did they handle
the interview with you?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I was
filmed in Los Angeles.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And then they just
did a voiceover

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.091 align:middle line:84%
of my voice to
make it so that it

00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
sounds like I'm
speaking in Russian.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Did you like the voice
they picked for you?

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: It was a little
hokey, but pretty good.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY (IN RUSSIAN ACCENT):
Yep, the Federal Reserve.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: They called
me a noted economist,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.205 align:middle line:84%
which I guess I kind of have
to alter my job description.

00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: David is with me
on many speaking engagements

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:90%
around the country.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
He is probably one of
the most brilliant people

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:90%
I've ever talk to.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to find out why.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But he's the hardest
person to introduce

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
because you do so
many different things.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
pin him down and say,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:90%
this is David Wilcock.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And so when you talked
about the Federal Reserve,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
we've never talked about
the Federal Reserve

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:90%
together on "Coast to Coast."

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So your experience
is very widely,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I guess, accepted all
around the planet now.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Well, I got
involved in a pretty wild thing.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
There's an alliance now of 150
nations, approximately 150,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
who have seen that they are
systematically being wiped out

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:84%
by a very small
group of oligarchs

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:84%
that are from
Europe and America.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even
really the countries

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:84%
as much as it is the
financial infrastructure that

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
has been built into
these countries.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And you have a situation in
which people are suffering.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
There's poverty
all over the world.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And I met with an
investor recently

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:90%
who's a multimillionaire.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that it
is embarrassing to him

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that, even with
how much less money

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
he has than many other people,
how easily these problems could

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
be solved-- world hunger,
people having sanitation,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:90%
people having running water.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Just if you give a kid
shoes for his feet,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:84%
the impact that that kid's
going to have on his health

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:90%
is tremendous.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's embarrassing
that we're not doing this

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
because we totally
have the ability to.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm not sure
they want to, David.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.501 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: That's the problem.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I think they want
to hold these countries down

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
as third world nations to
do whatever they have to do

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
to take advantage of these
people and to just try to keep

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.379 align:middle line:90%
a thumb on everything.

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Well, this actually
all ties in very nicely

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
to our topic because these folks
do have a religious background.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people
don't understand.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not Christianity.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not Islam.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not Judaism.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Don't blame this
on Jewish people.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.076 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing
to do with this.

00:05:30.076 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a mystery
school religion.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And the mystery school
religion is based on the idea

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
that if you follow
these teachings

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:84%
that you can attain
a specialized state

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.652 align:middle line:84%
of human evolution,
which they call

00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
the light body or
the rainbow body.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The rainbow body.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.528 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:05:47.528 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And explain
the rainbow body to us.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: You can look at
all different wisdom traditions

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
around the world-- Mithraism,
Gnosticism, Taoism, Buddhism,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian mythology, the Emerald
Tablets of Thoth, even in Peru,

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Mesoamerica.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And everybody got the
same message, ultimately.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us have
lost this message.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But the basic
teaching is that you,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
if you practice
these teachings, will

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:84%
be able to transmute
your physical body

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:90%
into a being of light.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And once you've done that, the
abilities that we associate

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
with Jesus after
his Resurrection

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
are abilities that
you will have.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a highly
controversial notion

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
when seen in light of
Christianity, especially

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
in a fundamentalist sense
where Jesus is the Son of God.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
He's the only one
who ever did that.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have
to reach that state only

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:90%
through Jesus Christ.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you're saying that
everybody can probably attain

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:90%
this on their own.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: We know that there
are 100,000 people that have

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:84%
attained this in China in the
Kathok Monastery since the 12th

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.540 align:middle line:90%
century.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It's written, documented, the
names of them, how they did it,

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Also, in Tibet, since
the 17th century,

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
there's a further 60,000
people documented-- names,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
everything about how they did
it, extensive written records.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's 160,000 documented
cases of this happening.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And those cases have
continued straight

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.110 align:middle line:90%
up until recent history.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:84%
We're literally
looking at a situation

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
where we have a Catholic
priest named Father Tiso who

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:84%
goes to Tibet and witnesses
people transforming

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:90%
into light firsthand.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like a beam of light?

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Well, it's a
little more complex than that.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But I'll discuss how that
works in just a second.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
point out, in addition

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
to the Catholic
priest, Father Tiso,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.590 align:middle line:84%
we also have the
Chinese military

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
that went in there with
all their instruments

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:90%
and equipment.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're literally
looking at people.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And you get wrapped
up in a shroud.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Basically, it is a death.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.360 align:middle line:90%
You appear to have died.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
These monks go into a
deep state of meditation.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:90%
They stop breathing.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Their body appears to be dead.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You then wrap them
in a burial shroud.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And they put them
in a special hut,

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and most people are
instructed not to go in there.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens
in most cases--

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:84%
there's three different
types of rainbow body.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And two out of
three work this way.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:90%
The third one is a spontaneous.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.749 align:middle line:84%
You just turn into
light just like that.

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like Jesus
might have done.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Right.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Because of
the Shroud of Turin.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
We look at the Shroud of
Turin-- just real briefly

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:90%
an aside there.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever
seen it, you know

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.304 align:middle line:84%
that the image that
you usually see

00:08:57.304 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
looks like it's black
in the background,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a white
ghostly image of Jesus's face.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.177 align:middle line:84%
Well that's because it's
a photographic negative.

00:09:04.177 --> 00:09:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a negative.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: The original
is actually on white linen,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's a fully
three-dimensional image

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus's body.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And the carbon dating
that they've done on it

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:84%
was where they cut off the
little triangular pieces

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.252 align:middle line:84%
that you see that were
replaced in the 12th century.

00:09:23.252 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So of course it's going to
date from the 12th century

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
because they only
dated that part.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is,
the only mechanism

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
that could have created
that image on the shroud

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:84%
is a sudden spontaneous
laser like burst of light

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:84%
across the whole surface
of the body simultaneously.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't realize

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
that many of the apostles
after Jesus ascended also

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:90%
achieved light body, as well.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was described in
the Bible that tons of fire

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:90%
came down upon them.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.881 align:middle line:90%
They literally just poof.

00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:55.210 align:middle line:90%
It looked like they lit on fire.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we don't
normally hear is

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:84%
that here's the Chinese
military and here is

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
this Catholic priest, who
was specifically chartered

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to go over there and study this
phenomenon, who have witnessed

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.369 align:middle line:90%
this in modern times happening.

00:10:10.369 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:90%
So let's say you're meditating.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
You're the monk that's
about to ascend,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:84%
as many people
call it ascension.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Your body slumps over.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:90%
You stop breathing.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle line:84%
They wrap you in
this burial shroud.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And then over the course
of seven days in this hut,

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:84%
people start seeing rainbows
coming off the top of the hut.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:90%
They hear music.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:84%
They smell wonderful
perfume type of odors.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sort of a
magical feeling around there.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:84%
When people go
inside, sometimes you

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
can see through some of the
wrappings on the burial shroud.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And what you start to see is
that the body is shrinking.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing
that's really fascinating

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:84%
is that people who have
a wizened face, people

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
who have a lot of lines on their
face, their skin turns pinkish

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and the lines disappear.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Their age appears to start
reversing in the shroud

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.840 align:middle line:90%
as this process is taking place.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And the body shrinks and shrinks
and shrinks and shrinks over

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:90%
the course of seven days.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there's two different
types of things that happen.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.260 align:middle line:84%
One thing that happens--
and this is sort

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:84%
of the less-than-fully-ideal
rainbow body creation--

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.256 align:middle line:84%
is that you leave behind
this little ashy body.

00:11:26.256 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%
And literally--

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like
you've been cremated.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Right.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.107 align:middle line:84%
But like, maybe
you had McDonalds

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
or you ate some
Twinkies or something.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's
something left behind

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:84%
in your body that
leaves this little ash

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:90%
that looks like a little man.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:84%
You can actually see
plenty of pictures

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
on the internet where they
take that little ashy body

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:90%
and they dress it up in clothes.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's that solid.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: They wrap it up.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
First they put a
white cloth around it.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.569 align:middle line:84%
It's got a little cloth head,
little cloth arms and legs.

00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Just little stumps.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't make
it too elaborate.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And then they dress it up.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.053 align:middle line:90%
They give it a little headdress.

00:11:59.053 --> 00:12:01.020 align:middle line:90%
They give it a little uniform.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they put it on the
pedestal to honor that teacher.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.604 align:middle line:84%
And that this is the goal
that everybody in the Nyingma

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
sect-- because that's
the sect that does this.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It's Dzogchen
Buddhism, Nyingma sect.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.689 align:middle line:84%
And that's also where
it was in China.

00:12:15.689 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the path that everybody's
trying to go for here.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: David, we're going
to continue talking about

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:90%
the rainbow body.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:84%
But let's take some
questions, also,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:90%
from the audience for you.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:24.778 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Sure.

00:12:24.778 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Questions from you for
David Wilcock as we talk about

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
a very strange topic,
the rainbow body,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:32.987 align:middle line:90%
and what that all is.

00:12:32.987 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Who's got something there?

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to dive
in here with David?

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well, it's
a little bit off topic.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.720 align:middle line:84%
But I'm wondering if you--
I know you have access

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.980 align:middle line:84%
to information that,
perhaps, not all of us do.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering if
you'd be willing to share

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
the latest in geopolitical
happenings around the world

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:90%
and in the United States.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you've had
any interesting dreams lately.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.245 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now
that's interesting.

00:12:57.245 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You do have access
to a lot of sources

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:90%
that most people do not.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Yeah,
it's pretty strange.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I find myself in
a unique position

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
because I have been a
public figure since 1996

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.120 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I've had my own
websites since 1999.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.235 align:middle line:84%
And I have been on "Coast"
since, I guess, 2000.

00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Many times.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:90%
At least.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: 2001.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Like what, 12 or 13
times at least by now.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result,
it's easy for people

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
to think that this whole
UFO subject is a joke.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
What it turns out is
that it's very real.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:84%
There are humans
all over the galaxy.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And the US military and branches
of our military industrial

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
complex have had
diplomatic relationships

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:84%
with humans from other worlds
going back for over a century.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
literally talking about,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.580 align:middle line:84%
George, is humans materializing
in the Oval Office,

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:84%
showing up in front of the
President of United States,

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.355 align:middle line:90%
going back for a century.

00:14:09.355 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's not something I've
said before, but it's true.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
You have people who have
worked in top secret programs

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and have interacted
with humans who

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:90%
have attained light body status.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole grade of
human evolution that we reach,

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:84%
at which point we now
have stargates, telepathy,

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
instantaneous healing,
levitation capabilities.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.714 align:middle line:84%
All these things are
standard for the humans that

00:14:36.714 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
have been visiting
us and appeared

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
as gods going back 11,000
years in our history.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And how far in advance
are they from us in terms

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:90%
of living?

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Millions of years?

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.086 align:middle line:90%
Billions?

00:14:51.086 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: You could say
they're millions of years

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Or you could say they're
only one quantum leap away.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, that's true.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And if the
quantum leap is something

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that's actually going to
be happening pretty soon,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:84%
then maybe it's not
that far away at all--

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And he wanted to
know what your dreams are like.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.726 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I have been
having a lot of dreams.

00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Just a little back story because
I know that for somebody who's

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.849 align:middle line:84%
never heard this before, it's
going to sound a little crazy.

00:15:15.849 --> 00:15:19.759 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I guess we let the
cat out of the bag

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.924 align:middle line:84%
when you said Edgar
Cayce reincarnated.

00:15:22.924 --> 00:15:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So I probably don't need
a lot of back story.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But I've been writing my
dreams down every morning,

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:84%
every morning, since
September, 1992.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The day I stopped using alcohol,
marijuana, tobacco-- completely

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
quit everything-- was
September 20, 1992.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And the next day I started
to write my dreams down

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:90%
every morning.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I found very quickly,
George, that they

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:84%
were an incredible source of
prophetic information, accurate

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:90%
prophecies of future events.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I had posted on my
website some dreams

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:84%
that I had under an article
called "Bouncing Back

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.780 align:middle line:90%
from Hack Attack."

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was describing-- it was
a joke because my website had

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.832 align:middle line:84%
gotten hacked, and
I had a bad cold.

00:16:07.832 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:90%
So I was hacking.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:90%
So it was a double entendre.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And in that article, which
you can still go see,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.865 align:middle line:84%
I was getting so many
dreams telling me

00:16:16.865 --> 00:16:19.450 align:middle line:84%
that something really bad was
about to happen on Earth that I

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.420 align:middle line:90%
couldn't help but post them.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I took a big risk because
you know me, George.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.654 align:middle line:90%
I am not doom and gloom.

00:16:25.654 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
You've brought plenty
of people on your show--

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They've
been doom and gloom.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.206 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Who trend
in that direction.

00:16:30.206 --> 00:16:31.894 align:middle line:90%
But I am always saying, no.

00:16:31.894 --> 00:16:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
the positive one.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: We've got to
focus on the positive,

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:90%
focus on the golden age.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'm having all these dreams
showing big, big disaster.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is disaster that
was really, really shocking.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.284 align:middle line:84%
And I finally got
so many data points

00:16:47.284 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:90%
that I put it on my website.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it appears
that some major disaster

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.547 align:middle line:90%
is about to happen.

00:16:53.547 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Less than two weeks after
I put that on my website

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:90%
was Fukushima.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And the dreams completely
described exactly what

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:01.110 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
feeling these things.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Yes.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take
another question,

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:84%
then I want to talk
about your dreams, David.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.312 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you had a
question for David?

00:17:09.312 --> 00:17:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: You're talking
about people transcending

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:90%
into light beings in China.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And the government and so forth
were trying to figure it out,

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are
teachings in China that are not

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
really known to Western
civilization, such

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
as-- there is to
a certain extent.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:84%
But there's grand masters
that have mastered

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:84%
the art of qai and kai
and who have mastered

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.100 align:middle line:90%
the art of yin and yang and chi.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And they can actually
physically use it.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.961 align:middle line:90%
And you can physically feel it.

00:17:33.961 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And they use it to help
people and to heal people.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can physically see them
when they use a thermal camera.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:90%
And their hands get warm.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The materials that
they're using get warm.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And the testimonials
and stuff like

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that-- my question is that
these teachings are very, very

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:90%
secret.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And I would assume that the
light beings, those teachings

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:84%
are very secret, as well, and
they're not very known here.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.481 align:middle line:84%
How come it's so
secret and it's only

00:17:58.481 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
kept over there versus trying
to share it with everybody else

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and helping everybody to
ascend to be a better being?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Wow.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Big question.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that part of the reason
why it has become so secret

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
is simply because it's faded.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Originally, this
tradition was widespread

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.150 align:middle line:84%
amongst many different
religious teachings.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And over time, because of the
difficulty of attaining rainbow

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:84%
body-- you know,
these people are

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:84%
meditating for 40
years in a cave.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
It appears specifically
that Tibetan Buddhism

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:90%
has kept the lineage pure.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
potential destructiveness

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.737 align:middle line:84%
of these consciousness
powers that you can gain,

00:18:36.737 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to teach
it to just anybody.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to pass
initiation and be

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.721 align:middle line:84%
deemed to be ready for the
teaching to be given to you.

00:18:43.721 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But I do want to talk
after the break more

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
about what those
teachings are and how

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.864 align:middle line:84%
you attain this
yourself, potentially.

00:18:48.864 --> 00:18:51.446 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We're going to be back
in a moment. "Beyond Belief,"

00:18:51.446 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:90%
David Wilcock.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I call him the human
computer, and he is.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.265 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:18:57.265 --> 00:18:58.598 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Thank you very much.

00:18:58.598 --> 00:19:01.052 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:01.052 --> 00:19:05.285 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:05.285 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief"

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.951 align:middle line:90%
with David Wilcock.

00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:84%
David, I want to talk
about your dreams

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and also a little bit more
of the previous question

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that you wanted to elaborate
on about just what's

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
out there with all these
strange groups that

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.230 align:middle line:90%
have these mystical powers.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.782 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Well, OK.

00:19:21.782 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember,
now, that one

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
of the traditions that has
the rainbow body in it--

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and I think they call it the
light body-- is Mithraism.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is Mithraism.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Mithraism, in some senses,
could be seen as a precursor

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:90%
to Christianity.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Mithras and the
legend of Mithras

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of similarities
to the Christ archetype.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Mithraism was a sect that met
in small groups in secret.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And what we basically see is
that Mithraic mystery school

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:90%
teachings became freemasonry.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.120 align:middle line:84%
The predominant
inheritance of freemasonry

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:90%
comes from Mithraism.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Mithraism is all about
attaining light body.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:84%
The founding fathers of the
United States of America

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:84%
called themselves
perfectibilists.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And that term is derived from
their secret mystery teaching

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:90%
regarding attaining light body.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And William Henry's
research has been

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:24.390 align:middle line:84%
very instrumental in this
category because he points out,

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.540 align:middle line:84%
for example, if you walk
into the Congress building

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and you look up at the top of
the dome inside the Congress,

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
up in the top there's
a painting up there.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
called "The Apotheosis

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:90%
of George Washington."

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, "apotheosis,"
as you know, George,

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:90%
means "man becomes God."

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
They're literally drawing
George Washington hovering

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
on a rainbow with
all of the gods

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and goddesses of
the mystery schools.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And because he is
pictured on a rainbow,

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that is indicative
of George Washington

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:84%
attaining rainbow body because
there are very similar pieces

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
of art that depict Jesus on
a rainbow that looks exactly

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:84%
the same, indicating that Jesus
had attained rainbow body.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So the freemasonry has,
as we know, 33 degrees.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
What a lot of people don't know
is that if you take the coccyx,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
this bone chunk down at
the bottom of your spine,

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the
segments in the coccyx,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and you add that up with the
known vertebrae in the lower,

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:84%
middle, and cervical
regions, you get 33 segments.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's going on with that?

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:44.260 align:middle line:84%
It's because they think that
you are raising your Kundalini.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:84%
You're taking the energy
of the root chakra,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.759 align:middle line:84%
rising it up, and bringing
it up to the pineal gland.

00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, this gets into the
legend of the holy grail.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.383 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry I'm jumping
all around here.

00:21:55.383 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to give us a
tasting menu of some things.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The legend of the holy
grail is a metaphor.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not literal.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.960 align:middle line:90%
The chalice is the pineal gland.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a gland inside your brain
that's filled with water.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And we now know it's in
the exact geometric center

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:90%
the brain.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
They call it the third eye in
all these ancient traditions.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:90%
It's shaped like a chalice.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And the water of the
chalice, the sacred water,

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is actually where images
from your astral body

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:84%
are coming in and then
turning into light

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:84%
through little chemicals
that are piezochromatic,

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:90%
meaning they give off light.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the entire inside
of that pineal gland

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:84%
is lined with
retinal tissue, just

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:90%
like the retina in your eye.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.379 align:middle line:90%
But what is it looking at?

00:22:43.379 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at the images
coming in through the water.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So believe it or not, the
quest for the holy grail

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
is the quest to access
your pineal gland.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
The castle that the holy
grail is kept in is the skull.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the castle of the skull.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:01.270 align:middle line:84%
The grail quest is the
rising of the 33 segments

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
of the spine to achieve
the holy grail, which

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:90%
is activating your pineal gland.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
The Masonic mystery teachings--
as you reach 33rd degree Mason,

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:84%
supposedly you're now
able to consciously switch

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:84%
on your pineal gland, access
your divine potential,

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and be able to step forward
as one of these cloud walkers,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:90%
as they're called.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So it was believed that the
founding fathers of the United

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.110 align:middle line:84%
States of America
would automatically

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
attain rainbow body
state upon their death.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
George Washington

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.190 align:middle line:84%
is pictured on a rainbow having
attained rainbow body state.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Now your dreams-- you kind
of scared me a little bit

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:90%
when you talked about Fukushima.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Yes.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What else
are you dreaming?

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Well, it's even
crazier than that because I

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.250 align:middle line:84%
have a documented record
of everything that has been

00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:84%
dreamed by me every morning
since I started to write them

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:90%
all down on November 10, 1996.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had been writing them
down in notebooks in pen

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:90%
from 1992 to '96.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You wake up,
write it out right away.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:09.768 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:24:09.768 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But I have it all computerized
since November 10, 1996.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I had two different
visionary experiences

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that gave me specific
dates to go back and look

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:90%
at in my own transcripts.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:29.400 align:middle line:84%
One of them was in 1997,
and one of them was in 2002.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Both of these
windows of time, when

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.894 align:middle line:84%
I went back and looked at
them-- and I got specific dates.

00:24:35.894 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
One of them was
in a dream and one

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.684 align:middle line:84%
of them was in
this state of mind

00:24:38.684 --> 00:24:40.500 align:middle line:84%
when I was just waking
up in the morning

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and I heard this date
whispered into my ear,

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.870 align:middle line:90%
you know, from my higher self.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I look at these dates and I
start reading my transcripts

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
from these periods of
time, one 15 years ago

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:90%
and one 10 years ago.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And they are
absolutely describing

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:84%
what's happening
to me right now.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.320 align:middle line:84%
They're describing where I
live, who I'm living with,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
the specific details, even
to the point that I bought

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.845 align:middle line:84%
a used hot tub and that I have
to change out of my shorts

00:25:08.845 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:90%
when I come into the house.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like really
specific things.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:84%
By the way, it's very
expensive to run a hot tub

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
with the electric bill,
as I now found out.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It sure is.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:16.959 align:middle line:90%
It sure is.

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: A warning.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So the point is, ridiculously
specific information.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Very, very fine tuned.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And these prophecies
from 10 and 15 years ago

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
are totally lining up with what
my own dreams are saying, which

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
is that we are right on the
brink of a mass major exposure

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
of financial tyranny and a
dismantling of the Federal

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Reserve control
system that has been

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:90%
keeping us captive for so long.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is
extremely exciting.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If it
happens, if it happens--

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: OK, Mr. Pessimism.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: No, it's just-- it's
tough fighting the Federal

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Reserve.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Well, look, my tin
foil hat's on nice and snug.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm ready for it.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're ready to do it.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: If you don't
want to believe it,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:90%
that's your problem.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, we're going
to sit around and find out,

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:06.150 align:middle line:90%
aren't we?

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: But I'm
fighting for it, man.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the front line.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.424 align:middle line:84%
There's an alliance of
150 countries, George.

00:26:10.424 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I know that.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And
we are out there.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm risking my life, and I know
you're doing the same thing.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Ron Paul,
he was one of them.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.108 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:26:17.108 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to get
this thing to change.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: David, we're going
to come back in just a moment.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk with
you when we come

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
back more about
these rainbow bodies

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and also get into what you're
working on in the future.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.299 align:middle line:84%
Because you never
stop working, do you?

00:26:30.299 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: No, I really don't.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.177 align:middle line:84%
But the reward is that I get
to bring this message out.

00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And I really thank you for
having me on your show.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.218 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:26:38.218 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: More with David
Wilcock on "Beyond Belief"

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.904 align:middle line:90%
when we come right back.

00:26:41.904 --> 00:26:47.228 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:47.228 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.682 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief"

00:26:51.682 --> 00:26:53.140 align:middle line:84%
with my dear friend,
David Wilcock.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
David, let's talk a little bit
about your life as Edgar Cayce.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:90%
How did that all come about?

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: OK.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I was writing my dreams
down since September, 1992.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I start to have
dreams telling me

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:84%
that UFO beings
want to talk to me.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And by that point, I was very
convinced that UFOs were real

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:17.900 align:middle line:84%
because I'd actually
met with insiders

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.137 align:middle line:84%
who had confirmed things
that I'd heard since 1991.

00:27:21.137 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Whistle
blowers, people like that?

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.053 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: '92, actually.

00:27:24.053 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, whistle blowers.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I met this one guy who
had worked for Raytheon

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and McDonnell Douglas and SAIC,
these defense contractors.

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Heavy hitters.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And he
told me flat out, wow,

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:84%
the college professor that your
friend was talking to who told

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
you that UFOs are real and
that the Roswell crash was real

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and that we got computer chips
and Teflon and Velcro and LED

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:84%
lights and all these things
from it-- that's all true.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And there's much, much more.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
time that someone

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
tried to recruit me
into a psychic program

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:90%
for the government.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.640 align:middle line:90%
But I turned them down.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.742 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why?

00:27:59.742 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Because somebody
else at the UFO conference had

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:84%
gotten to me and had said, look,
David, if you get in there,

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
they're never going
to let you out.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
bound to this thing.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.710 align:middle line:90%
And they will just use you up.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So it was very hard for me
to turn that offer down,

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.110 align:middle line:90%
but I did.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, I've
met with more insiders.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So by 1996, I was
really convinced

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.220 align:middle line:90%
that something was going on.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I started to have
dreams indicating

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.524 align:middle line:84%
that the UFOs were
not just out there.

00:28:26.524 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just something
I'm reading about in books.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.650 align:middle line:84%
That these were real people,
and that if you're ready,

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:90%
they can talk to you.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:90%
And they wanted to talk to me.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I had one dream where
a UFO comes overhead

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.060 align:middle line:90%
and shoots this thing down.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.100 align:middle line:84%
It goes [WHOOSHING NOISE],
hits the ground.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.316 align:middle line:90%
And it's a telephone.

00:28:43.316 --> 00:28:45.442 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
this going, my God.

00:28:45.442 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And then the telephone
starts ringing.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.969 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:28:50.969 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And then I woke up.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.009 align:middle line:90%
And then I had another dream--

00:28:53.009 --> 00:28:54.762 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I hope it
wasn't a collect call.

00:28:54.762 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: That could
be very expensive.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a long distance.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.225 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:58.225 --> 00:28:59.160 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I had another dream
in which a ghost was talking

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.391 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear what
the ghost had to say.

00:29:05.391 --> 00:29:07.266 align:middle line:84%
And the ghost says,
well, nobody else

00:29:07.266 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:90%
can hear me but you, David.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So how about I talk
to you, and then you

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.400 align:middle line:84%
say what I'm telling you
into the tape recorder?

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.850 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, I can do that.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Cut to I'm on a discussion
forum on the internet dealing

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.920 align:middle line:90%
with paranormal subjects.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And I meet a man
named Joe Mason, who

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.634 align:middle line:84%
now has a website
called greatdreams.com.

00:29:26.634 --> 00:29:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And he's describing a technique
that he had called the dream

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:84%
voice, where he wakes
up in the morning

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.877 align:middle line:84%
and he listens to this
chatter that's in your mind.

00:29:34.877 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It sounds almost like there's
a TV on in the other room,

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and you can't quite make it out.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of
comes in and out.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.620 align:middle line:90%
It's very vague.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:84%
You might only get a few
words here and there.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, just listen as
carefully as possible

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.910 align:middle line:90%
and write everything down.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:49.562 align:middle line:84%
The very next
morning, I woke up.

00:29:49.562 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I tried to remember my dream.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.396 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I could
hear more of him talking.

00:29:54.396 --> 00:29:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And I had been
frantically taking

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:90%
notes when he was talking to me.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So then I start writing
down what it says.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:90%
I get done.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:90%
I got eight pages.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And it says at the
end, you can visit

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Chichen Itza with your mind.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the site in
Mesoamerica with the pyramids.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Right as I'm reading that,
the phone starts ringing.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's strange.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like
there was something

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.040 align:middle line:90%
important about this phone call.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It like tugged at my heart.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.720 align:middle line:90%
I pick it up, and it's this guy.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.090 align:middle line:84%
The same guy who warned me off
from joining the remote viewing

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me, hey,
there's a seminar today

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.490 align:middle line:84%
on astral projection, how to
take an out-of-body experience.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to go?

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, dude,
I just read that.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said this in words.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even know
what I was saying.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Then it turned out it also had
prophecies about Mother Teresa,

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:84%
that she was going to
have a heart attack.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And then she did
have a heart attack.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And she had one.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.643 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And so I start
writing this stuff down every

00:30:54.643 --> 00:30:57.430 align:middle line:84%
morning beginning
on November 10, '96.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's becoming
remarkable in terms

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
of how accurately it
predicts the future.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So almost like Edgar
Cayce when he was in his trance

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.249 align:middle line:84%
state, you're doing this
in your dream state.

00:31:07.249 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I had one
of the weirdest ones,

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.290 align:middle line:84%
which I've said many times, was
that my friend who I was living

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:90%
with, I got a reading for him.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And it said to him, you will be
happy to know that your student

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:22.610 align:middle line:84%
loans for New
Paltz have come in.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Now this is crazy because
we graduated from New Paltz.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.300 align:middle line:84%
He was now a graduate
student at SUNY Albany.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.633 align:middle line:84%
New Paltz, New York was
where we were going.

00:31:29.633 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a university for
the state of New York.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know, about
a month later, he says,

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.420 align:middle line:90%
David, you'd better sit down.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Sit down.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Then he tells me that New
Paltz, in the bursar's office,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
the financial office, was
cleaning out the office.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.170 align:middle line:84%
They pulled the file
cabinet away from the wall,

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and there's an envelope that
has an uncashed Stafford loan

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.290 align:middle line:84%
check in it made out
to my friend for $900.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.456 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And
it was still good.

00:31:57.456 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And we needed $847
to pay the rent.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And there it was.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.491 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And it said, you
will be happy to know that

00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:90%
your student loan has come in.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.247 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How does this happen?

00:32:07.247 --> 00:32:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: It bends time.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Just like for them,
they don't apparently

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.620 align:middle line:90%
see time the way we do.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:84%
We have a past,
present, and future.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:90%
You flew here in an airplane.

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.140 align:middle line:90%
You're going to fly home.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But in some reality that
these beings live in,

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.670 align:middle line:84%
you flew, you're
here, and you're

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.075 align:middle line:84%
flying home all
at the same time.

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Constantly.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.366 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Stuff that you're
going to do in 10 years they

00:32:27.366 --> 00:32:28.160 align:middle line:90%
already know.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.620 align:middle line:90%
But it's probability layers.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it's
only one thing.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.870 align:middle line:84%
But they can look
at the strongest

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.240 align:middle line:90%
vortexes of possibility.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the trick.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:90%
It's like a layered time.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.980 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
insiders call it.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:84%
All probabilities
co-exist with each other.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you see the
video about a year ago?

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.010 align:middle line:84%
We had it posted on
"Coast to Coast."

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty sure you did.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Of what people call
the time traveler?

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was done
in the late 1800s

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
on some kind of film
or graphic of a person

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.870 align:middle line:90%
holding a cell phone.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:84%
There's no question they were
holding a cell phone talking

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:07.180 align:middle line:90%
to someone from the late 1800s.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.350 align:middle line:90%
It was bizarre.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.130 align:middle line:84%
How does something
like that happen?

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Are there real time travelers?

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: There was some
speculation that that was

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:84%
a primitive type of hearing
aid that he was holding.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But it is definitely a fact
that time travel is already

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.490 align:middle line:90%
being used.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:84%
We do know that
the insiders have

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.710 align:middle line:84%
started to work with
this technology.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:84%
I have personal
contact with a guy

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:84%
who worked on the
Montauk Project.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.600 align:middle line:84%
This was where they took
a seat from a recovered

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.690 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial craft, hooked
it up to the proper power

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.370 align:middle line:84%
supply, and found out that
when you get in this seat

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:90%
it wires in with your brain.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And then what you think
about will become reality.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.137 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
manifest an object-- like,

00:33:52.137 --> 00:33:54.720 align:middle line:84%
let's say you want to manifest
an old-fashioned antique wooden

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.627 align:middle line:90%
chair.

00:33:55.627 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:90%
You just sit in the chair.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
You start thinking about
it and the chair appears.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of movies have used this
secret knowledge, like "X-Men."

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.560 align:middle line:84%
In every "X-Men" movie, there's
a focus on this chair called

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Cerebro.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Cerebro is where
you get in the chair

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and it amplifies your
psychic ability dramatically.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, your
psychic ability actually

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:84%
can create a portal
in the room that

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.409 align:middle line:84%
will take you to
another location.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And people could go
through these portals

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.670 align:middle line:90%
and end up in those locations.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.840 align:middle line:90%
But not just in space, George.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.539 align:middle line:90%
They could time travel, as well.

00:34:31.539 --> 00:34:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Anyplace.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:35.219 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've heard the
story of the person who

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:40.550 align:middle line:84%
got hit by a cab in New
York dressed in 1800s garb.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knew
who the person was.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.456 align:middle line:90%
No ID, nothing.

00:34:44.456 --> 00:34:45.914 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are convinced--

00:34:45.914 --> 00:34:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I am-- that he was
a time traveler who

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.739 align:middle line:84%
came through one
of these portals.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: That's right.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Actually, did have ID on him,
and it was very primitive ID.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was able to be matched
up with a missing person story

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:90%
from like 40 years earlier.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: From that period.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And he gets hit by
a cab in New York.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:00.835 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Right.

00:35:00.835 --> 00:35:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Because he was scared.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.290 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know
what was going on.

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, he was right
in the middle of the street.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:04.361 align:middle line:90%
Plow.

00:35:04.361 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:90%
Killed him.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.401 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:35:05.401 --> 00:35:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: There's
plenty of cases.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.200 align:middle line:84%
There's basically 12 vortex
points around the world

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.340 align:middle line:84%
where disappearances
seem to happen.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.250 align:middle line:84%
That was all cataloged by
Ivan Sanderson in the 1960s.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.820 align:middle line:84%
He looked for all the missing
planes, all the missing ships

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:90%
on the sea--

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And people.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.238 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: And people.

00:35:21.238 --> 00:35:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Spontaneous
vanishings, like here's

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.867 align:middle line:84%
a farmer walking
down in his field.

00:35:24.867 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He's gone.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: He's
vanished just like that.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: David, we're going to
take some more questions from

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.740 align:middle line:90%
the audience for you.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.850 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Hey, I
have an old friend.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.820 align:middle line:90%
She's about 103.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:34.940 align:middle line:90%
She's in a nursing home.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: That
is an old friend.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.239 align:middle line:84%
She swears-- and it was
either Saint Louis, Missouri

00:35:39.239 --> 00:35:40.280 align:middle line:90%
or Kansas City, Missouri.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.488 align:middle line:90%
She can't remember the paper.

00:35:41.488 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:84%
But when she was
four years old--

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:49.190 align:middle line:84%
so roughly 98 years ago--
she remembers some sort

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:54.262 align:middle line:84%
of a football-shaped whole
series of light up in the sky.

00:35:54.262 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was a whole
bunch of lights.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.700 align:middle line:90%
And she's an avid football fan.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And she said is was as
big as a football field.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It was
the Goodyear Blimp.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: No, it
was too long ago.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.392 align:middle line:84%
And I called back there to try
and find the story for her.

00:36:06.392 --> 00:36:07.350 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't find it.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I just wanted
to get it to her.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I called
wherever I called

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and to the library in
Missouri or Kansas,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.830 align:middle line:84%
whichever one I called,
the guy said, you know,

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say this.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But I started talking
to a local guy.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've
witnessed this 40 years

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:26.550 align:middle line:90%
after she witnessed it.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It was another
football field thing.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the newspapers,
and they couldn't find it.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said they wouldn't
even talk about it.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.350 align:middle line:90%
But he had witnessed it himself.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered if you
know what that is.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what it is.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And I can't even help
her find the article.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Sure.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.860 align:middle line:84%
You have to
remember-- and I know

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.068 align:middle line:84%
you've had him on "Coast"
a bunch of times-- Sergeant

00:36:46.068 --> 00:36:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Clifford Stone.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Incredible witness.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Here's a guy who was
contracted for the US military,

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.050 align:middle line:84%
in secret, to do
extraterrestrial crash

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.340 align:middle line:90%
retrieval missions.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.290 align:middle line:90%
The ship crashes.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's got to be
the first contact.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with this is that

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.840 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrial
beings who

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.610 align:middle line:84%
have reached this state,
this ascendant state, they

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:09.560 align:middle line:90%
still have a body.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And the body can
be very damaged.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:84%
They can still be
wounded from the crash.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And you get a full
download of what they feel,

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.950 align:middle line:90%
including all the pain.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:21.050 align:middle line:84%
If your leg has been
chopped off, you feel that.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So Sergeant Clifford Stone
was given a flip book

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.560 align:middle line:84%
of the different types
of extraterrestrials

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that are operating in and
around Earth's airspace.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's 57
different varieties.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Species, yeah.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: All of
which are hominid/human.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And each of these
different types

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.760 align:middle line:90%
has a corresponding craft.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, the football shape,
what you're describing,

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.230 align:middle line:84%
is similar to what
people were calling

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.810 align:middle line:84%
airship sightings,
which did occur.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:52.022 align:middle line:84%
There was a mass wave of airship
sightings in the late 1800s.

00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:53.480 align:middle line:84%
The reason why they
thought of them

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.110 align:middle line:84%
as an airship is
the football shape

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.070 align:middle line:84%
is similar to a
blimp or a zeppelin.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.441 align:middle line:84%
But these things do not
move like a blimp at all.

00:38:00.441 --> 00:38:02.190 align:middle line:84%
They just zing, zing,
zing around the sky.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to
remember when people say,

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.580 align:middle line:84%
oh, I wonder where
they come from,

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have a huge number
of humans visiting us

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.630 align:middle line:90%
from different points of origin.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And they have contacted us all
throughout ancient history.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, tying in the theme of
our show, the number one thing

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.680 align:middle line:84%
that all these gods kept
wanting us to know about

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.440 align:middle line:84%
is that you can attain rainbow
body, light body state.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:90%
It is possible.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And, they said, it
would begin to be

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.360 align:middle line:84%
possible after the
end of the year 2012,

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.604 align:middle line:90%
which is why I'm so excited.

00:38:32.604 --> 00:38:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Here we are.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.254 align:middle line:84%
Well, if anybody gets
it, it'll be you.

00:38:35.254 --> 00:38:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I'm going to work
for it and see what happens.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.480 align:middle line:90%
But I'll stick around.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.646 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to just leave.

00:38:39.646 --> 00:38:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Another
question for David?

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi, David.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:49.080 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
seeing through the astral body

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.920 align:middle line:84%
or receiving the visions
or recounting your dreams,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.180 align:middle line:84%
you talked about before that we
are all basically in a trance

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and that there is the
veil, that we aren't

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:84%
able to see what is beyond
this physical world.

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And that you had
expressed on your video

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.515 align:middle line:84%
that there was proof to
that with different things

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:12.970 align:middle line:90%
that were done with hypnosis.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering,
has there ever been

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.420 align:middle line:84%
anyone that used
posthypnotic suggestion

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see
through the veil,

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:26.210 align:middle line:84%
to see what is beyond, to
see the other dimensions,

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:27.540 align:middle line:90%
to know what is there?

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.252 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
of that being done?

00:39:29.252 --> 00:39:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Absolutely.

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:90%
I have some documented examples.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.650 align:middle line:84%
There's over 1,000
academic references

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:84%
in my book, "Source Field
Investigations," which

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.530 align:middle line:84%
was a "New York
Times" bestseller.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
ones is stage hypnosis

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:90%
of an ordinary man.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.540 align:middle line:90%
And they hypnotized this guy.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And they tell him,
you're not going

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.390 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see your daughter.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Her body will not exist.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:90%
You won't hear her.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.285 align:middle line:90%
You won't see her at all.

00:39:55.285 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And she could
be right in front of him.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Right.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And they bring this
guy out of trance.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
He's under a posthypnotic
suggestion, just like you said.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.626 align:middle line:84%
And his daughter is standing
right in front of him.

00:40:05.626 --> 00:40:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking
around the room.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.500 align:middle line:84%
He's looking right
through her body.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It appears that
he can't see her.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:11.240 align:middle line:90%
She's giggling.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.620 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't hear the giggling.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Then the hypnotist takes
out a gold pocket watch.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And nobody in the audience
has seen what it is.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.120 align:middle line:84%
He pulls it out quickly
from his blazer pocket,

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.920 align:middle line:84%
puts it into the small
of her back, and says,

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:84%
can you see what's in
my hand, to the guy.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And the guy is staring
through his daughter.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.640 align:middle line:90%
And he sees through her body.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.174 align:middle line:84%
And he can actually read the
inscription on the watch.

00:40:37.174 --> 00:40:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hidden behind her.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And that's
an ordinary guy.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's another case.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Cleve Backster, one of
the top polygraph specialists

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.690 align:middle line:90%
for the CIA--

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He's the one who
put plants-- he tested plants.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And he standardized
the method of reading

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.320 align:middle line:84%
polygraphs to see
if somebody's lying.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Backster did stage
hypnosis demonstrations

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.790 align:middle line:84%
in which he told somebody,
you won't be able to see me.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And that person then
couldn't see him.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And he would light a cigarette
and start smoking it.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.781 align:middle line:84%
And the person would
become terrified

00:41:06.781 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and want to run off the stage
because what he's seeing

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.835 align:middle line:84%
is a levitating cigarette
with smoke coming off of it.

00:41:11.835 --> 00:41:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Backster put electrodes on
two plants in a dark room

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and recorded the energy
waves that these plants

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.920 align:middle line:90%
were giving off.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.380 align:middle line:84%
He sent a guy into the room who
ripped out one of the plants

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and tore it apart.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And you could see the
vibrations on the other plant.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The guy left and then came
back a little bit later.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And the vibrations on
that surviving plant

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:39.740 align:middle line:90%
went through the roof.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.500 align:middle line:90%
It was alive.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Absolutely.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It was
like it could feel.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.340 align:middle line:90%
It could see.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another question
for David before we break.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I had a
question regarding earlier.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.080 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about mystery schools.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And you got into Masonic
mystery schools a little bit.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:56.210 align:middle line:90%


00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been really interested
in Rock Gate Park or Coral

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Castle in Homestead, Florida.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've got the feeling that
possibly Edward Leedskalnin was

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.240 align:middle line:84%
involved in one of
these mystery schools.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.365 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Unquestionably.

00:42:08.365 --> 00:42:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And possibly he
was trying to divulge a lot

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.740 align:middle line:84%
of information to us in
maybe like a way that--

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.430 align:middle line:84%
maybe he had to do
it in a certain way

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.560 align:middle line:84%
because of a certain oath that
he was under or something.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if you could
talk about that a little bit?

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: OK, sure.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.823 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And Coral
Castle, of course,

00:42:23.823 --> 00:42:26.830 align:middle line:84%
being the area where these
huge blocks of stone made this

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:31.670 align:middle line:84%
structure by this 120-pound
man who once said he knew

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.701 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of how the
pyramids were built.

00:42:33.701 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Right.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, I've been to Coral Castle.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you go there,
you can see the secret.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.980 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of off to the side.

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Have you been there, George?

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Have you been?

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I've not.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:43.601 align:middle line:90%
I know you've been.

00:42:43.601 --> 00:42:44.675 align:middle line:90%
Hoagland's been there.

00:42:44.675 --> 00:42:46.122 align:middle line:90%
I haven't been there.

00:42:46.122 --> 00:42:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: There is this very
strange-looking thing that

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Leedskalnin made out of
old automobile parts.

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's got this little
thing in the middle.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.120 align:middle line:90%
It's made of four little lobes.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And then it's got all
these pieces of metal

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.326 align:middle line:90%
in a big circle like a ring.

00:43:01.326 --> 00:43:02.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's got a crank on it.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can crank
this thing around.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
magnetic flywheel.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, you look at the
pictures and what he's got

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:14.530 align:middle line:84%
is tripods that have these
magnetic flywheels up

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:15.160 align:middle line:90%
at the top.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.482 align:middle line:90%
He cranks it.

00:43:16.482 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're right.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.090 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And it appears that
Leedskalnin knew the secret,

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:30.050 align:middle line:84%
which is that gravity is
actually what feeds matter.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Leedskalnin wrote a
very strange series

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.930 align:middle line:84%
of books in which he encoded
a lot of information, which

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.220 align:middle line:84%
is how the mystery
schools do it, too.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And he basically
says in his books

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.035 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
made of magnets.

00:43:42.035 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Everything?

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Everything.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And that once you
understand this,

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.700 align:middle line:84%
you can manipulate
these magnets.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It appears that our
gravitational field is actually

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.870 align:middle line:90%
what feeds physical matter.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.349 align:middle line:84%
Gaiam TV has a video
called "Black Whole"

00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:58.140 align:middle line:90%
by Nassim Haramein.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I know you've had
him on the show.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, good man.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Nassim has
proven with extensive physics

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.920 align:middle line:84%
equations that gravity
is what makes atoms.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's talk about more
Edward Leedskalnin and Coral

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Castle because
that fascinates me.

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:12.270 align:middle line:90%
You've been there.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be back
with David Wilcock.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.440 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond Belief," we
shall be right back.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.356 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: All right.

00:44:17.356 --> 00:44:18.100 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.016 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Thank you.

00:44:19.016 --> 00:44:23.894 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, here we are.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:25.790 align:middle line:90%
It's "Beyond Belief."

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:26.830 align:middle line:90%
David Wilcock with us.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.470 align:middle line:84%
David, we were talking
about Edward Leedskalnin--

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.660 align:middle line:90%
120-pound person from Latvia.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Came to this
country and somehow,

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:39.100 align:middle line:84%
by himself, built
Coral Castle, which

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.150 align:middle line:90%
are huge blocks of structure.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:44.360 align:middle line:84%
This whole place is built-- his
chair was made out of stone.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
made out of stone.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.520 align:middle line:84%
He even moved it because
he was getting harassed.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So he moved it to
Homestead, Florida

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.340 align:middle line:84%
from another
location in Florida.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And a truck driver showed
up with a flatbed truck.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And Skalnin said, go
away for a little bit.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Leave your truck.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I'll have everything
on it in a few hours.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.945 align:middle line:84%
And the truck driver looked
at him and went, what?

00:45:07.945 --> 00:45:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, don't
worry about it.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Just leave.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:16.130 align:middle line:84%
He came back in a few hours
and this entire structure--

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.660 align:middle line:84%
it's like a house built
out of rock and stone,

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:84%
huge-- was loaded onto
this flatbed truck.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.789 align:middle line:84%
And to this day,
the truck driver

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:27.080 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know how that happened.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.950 align:middle line:84%
There was another story
where children at night-- Ed

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:33.900 align:middle line:90%
would work by himself.

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:37.930 align:middle line:84%
They snuck in at night and
kind of looked over the walls

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and said that they saw him
moving things, floating things

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.810 align:middle line:90%
into place.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.190 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible story.

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: It is.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:52.540 align:middle line:84%
We have a really good historical
precedent for technology

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.250 align:middle line:84%
that exists that can soften
stone and bring it to the point

00:45:56.250 --> 00:46:00.290 align:middle line:84%
where it loses almost all of
its weight in our reality.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've heard
of Saksaywaman in Peru.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:08.760 align:middle line:84%
You have these massive stones,
100 tons in some cases,

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.850 align:middle line:84%
that just appear to
be mushed together.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And the cracks in
between the stones

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.960 align:middle line:84%
are so precise
that you can't even

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.970 align:middle line:90%
fit a razor blade in there.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet conventional
archaeologists

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:84%
would tell us,
oh, well they just

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.922 align:middle line:90%
wanted to save on the stone.

00:46:22.922 --> 00:46:24.380 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to waste any stone

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.040 align:middle line:84%
so that's why they carved them
into these weird positions.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why not
make something that

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:31.650 align:middle line:84%
looks nice like
intersecting triangles

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:32.740 align:middle line:90%
or hexagons or something?

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Why would you just
try to save stone?

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:36.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's plenty of stone.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:37.840 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to run out.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So then we also see a very
strange thing in Peru.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.355 align:middle line:84%
It's also in the
Cambodian temples.

00:46:46.355 --> 00:46:49.520 align:middle line:84%
It's also in Egypt, where
you see these bow ties,

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.550 align:middle line:84%
these metal bow ties
that appear to be

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:54.200 align:middle line:90%
mushed in between two stones.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it's as
if the bow ties are

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.060 align:middle line:84%
being used to hold
the stone together.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you tried to
haul a bunch of stones

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.969 align:middle line:84%
that big and the only thing
that holds them together

00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:04.510 align:middle line:84%
is a little bronze
clamps at the top?

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Couldn't be done.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: They'd
all fall apart.

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.524 align:middle line:84%
But if you can make them
as light as balloons

00:47:08.524 --> 00:47:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and you can just push
them with your hands,

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:12.350 align:middle line:90%
then that becomes possible.

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Dunn, another
guy you've had on the show.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Considers the
pyramids power plants.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Right.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And he has the granite coffer
in the king's chamber pyramid.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the
granite sarcophagus

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.170 align:middle line:84%
is carved with
drills that appear

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to be moving five times
faster than the best

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.170 align:middle line:90%
diamond-tipped drills today?

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:32.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not the drill.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:34.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the stone.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that they had a
technology that softens stone.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, if you
get advanced enough,

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that technology
can be nothing more

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.160 align:middle line:90%
than the power of the mind.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Leedskalnin had
two ways to do it.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:48.485 align:middle line:84%
The technology way to do it
was that cranking flywheel

00:47:48.485 --> 00:47:50.750 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking
about before, which

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.440 align:middle line:90%
essentially activates the grid.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.550 align:middle line:84%
You'll know from the
history of Coral Castle

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that he had to move
it at one point.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.758 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And its current
location is in Homestead,

00:47:59.758 --> 00:48:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Florida.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:84%
He was able to see that these
energy vortex points on Earth

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.610 align:middle line:90%
were drifting.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And his crank devices
on top of the tripod

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.500 align:middle line:90%
were no longer effective.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So he had to move
the site to an area

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.240 align:middle line:90%
where the energy was stronger.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it is today.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.930 align:middle line:90%
So it drifts over time.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:20.970 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the more you
do this you can eventually

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:22.680 align:middle line:84%
reach a point where
your consciousness is

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.840 align:middle line:84%
able to shift the
matter phase of stones.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.620 align:middle line:84%
People who reach rainbow
body or light body

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.660 align:middle line:90%
can do this very naturally.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:34.211 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans have a
discipline called lung-gom.

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What does that mean?

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Lung-gom is a guy.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Imagine now that this
is like a long road.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And this would be a
normal guy walking along.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.677 align:middle line:84%
Lung-goms will
actually go like this.

00:48:44.677 --> 00:48:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Leap, huh?

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: They make
huge, huge jumps.

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:48.870 align:middle line:90%
They go 30, 40 feet in the air.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:50.550 align:middle line:90%
200, 300 feet in one leap.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: As they stride.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: And the whole
trick is that you have to be

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.200 align:middle line:84%
in a very deep
state of meditation.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And you have this chant
that you're doing.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And you move your legs in
coordination with the chant.

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And every step is
one of the chants.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:09.185 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sort of like
when you walked in?

00:49:09.185 --> 00:49:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: "Gangnam Style."

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: David, in the
moments we have left,

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:20.760 align:middle line:84%
as you look toward 2013,
2014, what do things look like

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.730 align:middle line:90%
to you?

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I'm really excited
because over 30 ancient

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.570 align:middle line:84%
cultures, the gods gave them
this prophecy about a coming

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:30.250 align:middle line:90%
golden age.

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.100 align:middle line:90%
That's been the big question.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe December 21, 2012, the
end of the Mayan calendar,

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.910 align:middle line:84%
was going to be some spontaneous
light body activation.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.270 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So what I now see is that we
need to work together to help

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.150 align:middle line:90%
manifest that golden age.

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's two fronts for
that, as far as I can see.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.550 align:middle line:84%
There's the personal change,
and there's the global change.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The personal change
involves awakening people

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:57.510 align:middle line:90%
to their potential.

00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize that you have
the potential of these gods,

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:03.990 align:middle line:84%
that these master
teachers have given us

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.970 align:middle line:84%
an inheritance of
wisdom teachings

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that can help us
evolve-- and I'm

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.904 align:middle line:84%
going to have my own
show on Gaiam TV called

00:50:10.904 --> 00:50:11.695 align:middle line:90%
"Wisdom Teachings."

00:50:11.695 --> 00:50:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good for you.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Where I'm going
to be bringing this stuff out

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and teaching you the practical
things that you need to know

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:20.270 align:middle line:84%
to be able to achieve
these ascended states

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:21.460 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.910 align:middle line:84%
In addition, we've got to
work geopolitical angles.

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You've done an amazing job
of that, fighting this fight,

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:29.610 align:middle line:84%
exposing the Federal Reserve,
bringing out the truth

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:30.970 align:middle line:90%
about financial tyranny.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Because once we get disclosure,
once the average person knows

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that UFOs are real, that we
are not alone in the universe,

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.447 align:middle line:84%
that the big secret is that
they're not scary creatures--

00:50:41.447 --> 00:50:42.530 align:middle line:90%
they don't have tentacles.

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:44.160 align:middle line:90%
They're humans.

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a very different world.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, those people have
a prime directive.

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:50.942 align:middle line:84%
They have to hold back
until we're ready for them.

00:50:50.942 --> 00:50:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And in order for us
to be ready for them,

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:55.280 align:middle line:84%
we have to reach a certain
level of ethical and spiritual

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.340 align:middle line:84%
maturity, which means no
more fighting over my God

00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:59.960 align:middle line:90%
is better than your God.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that we are
now reaching that point where

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.990 align:middle line:84%
that potential is possible,
where the baton will be passed

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:08.320 align:middle line:84%
to us in this relay
race and we will

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.401 align:middle line:84%
enter into the true,
real space age.

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are we getting to
that point because of necessity?

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:18.324 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't as a
species, we may not exist?

00:51:18.324 --> 00:51:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I
believe that's true.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that our reaching
this point is also coordinated.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Roswell, in my opinion, was
deliberately planted technology

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.860 align:middle line:84%
so that we would have computers
and internet access in time

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.277 align:middle line:84%
for the end of the
Mayan calendar.

00:51:35.277 --> 00:51:36.651 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You may
be right there.

00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:37.520 align:middle line:90%
You may be right.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I think
they're helping us.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because without
that reverse technology,

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.709 align:middle line:84%
we would not have advanced
as far as we have right now.

00:51:43.709 --> 00:51:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Absolutely correct.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And God knows what
other technology we might be

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:49.450 align:middle line:90%
possessing because of that.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Well, there's
a lot more to come.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
Area 51 scientists

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.890 align:middle line:84%
who are ready to
start bringing out

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:58.610 align:middle line:90%
what they know to the public.

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:02.090 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force and the Navy,
in particular, those branches

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:05.440 align:middle line:84%
of the United States military--
the majority of these people

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.340 align:middle line:84%
do not support financial
tyranny or the Federal Reserve.

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.200 align:middle line:84%
They want to bring
out the truth.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.790 align:middle line:84%
They want to reveal
to the public

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that we have had ongoing
diplomatic relationships

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.140 align:middle line:84%
with well over 100
different species

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.690 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial humans.

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:20.410 align:middle line:84%
They want to reveal to
humanity that we already

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:21.900 align:middle line:90%
have stargate technology.

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:24.600 align:middle line:84%
We already have
light-speed travel.

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.580 align:middle line:84%
We already have deep-space
innerstellar spacecraft.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.150 align:middle line:84%
We are already living
in "Star Trek."

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:35.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it hasn't
been disclosed yet.

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, our lives will
change very quickly.

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.700 align:middle line:84%
We also have
materializer technology.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Imagine having
something the size

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.309 align:middle line:90%
of a refrigerator in your house.

00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And you think about
something that you want

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.992 align:middle line:90%
and it makes it for you.

00:52:46.992 --> 00:52:47.950 align:middle line:90%
They already have that.

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.500 align:middle line:84%
You can use materializers
to make other materializers.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.705 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I want one.

00:52:52.705 --> 00:52:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: So do I. The ETs
already are making food with

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:57.860 align:middle line:90%
materializers.

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:01.124 align:middle line:84%
You can think of the best meal
you ever had in your life,

00:53:01.124 --> 00:53:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and just by thinking
about it the materializer

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.710 align:middle line:84%
will make it exactly
the way you got it.

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:08.855 align:middle line:84%
And it digests into
pure nutrition,

00:53:08.855 --> 00:53:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and it cleans your
mouth as you eat it.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.938 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So the
future is bullish.

00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:13.655 align:middle line:90%
Let's here it for David Wilcock.

00:53:13.655 --> 00:53:14.571 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: All right.

00:53:14.571 --> 00:53:18.125 align:middle line:90%


00:53:18.125 --> 00:53:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, thanks for
watching another edition

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:21.080 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.538 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's kind
of nice to know

00:53:22.538 --> 00:53:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that we've got people like David
thinking for us for the future

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.615 align:middle line:84%
because we really do have
a bright future ahead.

00:53:29.615 --> 00:53:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Thanks, and we'll see
you on our next edition

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:32.560 align:middle line:90%

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:37.060 align:middle line:90%
