JASON SHURKA: February 6,
2020, there was a meeting.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I have been approached,
prepared, and chosen.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.140 align:middle line:84%
There are many
theories that we're

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.378 align:middle line:84%
the breeding of extraterrestrial
life and human beings,

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:90%
and that's exactly what we are.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:90%
And I'll take it a step further.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY: Did you see
the Ark of the Covenant?

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:84%
PATRICIA MONNA: I saw quite
a few things down there.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.463 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.463 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.450 align:middle line:84%
We've got a great
program for you.

Jason Shurka with
us, Vice President

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:10%
of a commercial real
estate firm based out

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:10%
of the Big Apple in
New York, and he's

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.930 align:middle line:10%
in charge of acquisitions
and development.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
He writes as a hobby and has
written and published a couple

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
books so far, both in the
realm of spirituality.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Jason, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: It's great to have you.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a video clip
from your YouTube channel

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that explains what happened
to you a couple years ago

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
and how it has led to what
we're talking about now.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.128 align:middle line:84%
Two years ago, I was approached
by somebody who presented

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:11.295 align:middle line:90%
himself to me as a stranger.

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Today, I know that that
was no coincidence.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:84%
We had some
conversations, anywhere

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
from the fundamental
nature of the universe

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.470 align:middle line:84%
to extraterrestrial
life to the pyramids

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and many other
fascinating things.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Over time, as our
relationship grew stronger,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
he revealed more and
more information to me,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and there came a point where
he revealed his affiliation

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to a specific organization
that has been in existence

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I'm
making this video today.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:10%
The organization has decided
after a very long existence

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:10%
to finally reveal themselves
for who they are, what they do,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:10%
and their purpose of
existing in the first place.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:10%
I want to start by
saying that I am not

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:10%
a part of the organization.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I am not initiated
into the organization.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I have just been
approached, prepared,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and chosen as a specific
messenger of information

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:90%
by this organization.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Who are the members
of this organization, Jason?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: There are about 7,000
of them worldwide that work

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.960 align:middle line:10%
around the entire planet.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:10%
Some are very well known.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:84%
They could be world
leaders, producers,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
celebrities in every realm
that we may-- we know.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: I could be in it.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: You could be in it,
and I would have no idea.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:10%
But most of the people that
work in TLS are not known.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:10%
They're just people with a
double life, with a cover,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:10%
and nobody knows
what they actually--

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: How were they recruited?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: That's a great question.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, from
my understanding so far--

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and I've only had really
two years of experience,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
because that's when it
started in my life--

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
they choose people, at least
the people that I know,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
based on an energetic criteria
that those people fit,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.512 align:middle line:84%
in terms of some sort
of energy or ability

00:03:37.512 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:90%
that they're born with.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: You're a piece
of a puzzle, aren't you?

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Completely.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And they
needed that piece.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: I guess so.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: What is their mission?

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.753 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Their purpose
is to guide humanity

00:03:49.753 --> 00:03:52.170 align:middle line:84%
in reaching a higher level of
consciousness and awareness.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: How do they do this?

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: In many,
many different ways.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.048 align:middle line:84%
They could guide--
again, without--

00:04:00.048 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that there
is a certain movement

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
that the government can
impose that can hurt humanity.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Mandatory vaccines.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: We can say that.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: All right.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.197 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So they will
play a role in stopping

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:90%
that behind the scenes.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's say somebody that
works in the government

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:90%
is part of TLS.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.059 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: If it's wrong,
they'll stop it.

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: If it goes against-- if
it's suppressing or controlling

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
humanity, it's a
no-no, because they're

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
trying to bring us
or at least guide us

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
to where we got
to get to, to what

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:84%
we would call fifth
dimensional awareness or above.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: How old is
this organization?

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Thousands of years old.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I know about 5,000
years old, but I

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:84%
don't have the exact
date when they started.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: So the ancients
started this thing.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.702 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Very, very long ago.

00:04:47.702 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: A long time ago.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And at this
point today, they're

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:84%
located all around the
planet, these 7,000 members?

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:84%
However, TLS doesn't
just work on Earth.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
They do have very
high technology.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
They are in contact
with other races.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
didn't mention it,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
but not all members are
part of the human race.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:90%
So there are other races today--

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: ETs.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.810 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Or whatever.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.018 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: That's what they are.

00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I just don't like
calling them aliens,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
because we live in a
universe, and in my eyes,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:90%
nobody's an alien.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:90%
They are extraterrestrial.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: What does TLS stand for?

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.700 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: The Light System.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Fascinating.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And it's had that
name since the get-go.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So-- OK,
from what I know,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a big connection
to the Hebrew language.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't mean Judaism.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew language
existed way before Judaism

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.635 align:middle line:84%
came to being in
the first place.

00:05:47.635 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew language actually
in Hebrew is called--

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:84%
the translation is
the divine language.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
The pharaohs used the
Hebrew language as well.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And there is a whole sort
of energetic resonance

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
between the letters
corresponding with numbers.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:90%
That's called gematria.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So in Hebrew, TLS
is called [HEBREW]

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
which means The Light
System, and it's

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:90%
been translated into English.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Why haven't we heard
about this organization before?

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: My first question--

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
two questions was, why
are you coming out now,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and why are you
choosing me to do it?

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Right.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing
that I would ask.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Did they answer that?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Yes, and their answers
were very simple, actually.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Why now?

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Because people are ready.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: How did
they approach you?

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.140 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: It's the
equivalent of somebody--

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.102 align:middle line:84%
I like wearing
crystal necklaces.

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's say somebody
comes up to you.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:90%
I like your necklace, you know?

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, two years ago when--

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:84%
the man who wrote "The
Pyramid Code," by the way,

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
was the same man
who approached me.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.370 align:middle line:84%
That person, when
he came up to me,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
came up to me as a stranger
to represent himself as,

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:90%
hey, how are you?

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I like your necklace.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Started asking me questions.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, I thought he
was a stranger,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and he wasn't, obviously,
because they knew exactly who I

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:84%
was, because they've
been following me

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So they knew what to ask and
what would spark my interest,

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:90%
and that's what he did.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So I've always liked things that
have to do with ancient aliens

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrials.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Technology, pyramids, and so on.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And those are the conversations
that he sparked with me.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And a stranger
turned into a friend,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and a friend turned into
a very powerful and strong

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.600 align:middle line:84%
relationship between
me and this person.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.630 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: And then he told you.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Over time.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Not in the beginning.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: And if you ask me, I
think it happened perfectly,

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:84%
because if he approached me at
that time on the street saying,

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.575 align:middle line:84%
hey, how are you, I come from
an organization with aliens

00:07:42.575 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and high technology, I
would probably look at him--

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:45.725 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: [LAUGHS]

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: See you.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: The disclosure
process that I was put through

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.990 align:middle line:84%
was done in a way where
it was appropriate for me

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and I was ready when I
received the information that

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:90%
was given to me.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Does date
February 6, 2020,

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:90%
have anything to do with this?

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Very much so.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So February 6 of 2020, this
year there was a meeting.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:84%
That meeting is referred
to in the document called

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
"The Pyramid Code,"
which by the way,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
there are other doc-- there is a
documentary called "The Pyramid

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Code" and another book
called "The Pyramid Code."

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to make it
clear that "The Pyramid

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Code" that I'm talking
about is on my website.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.420 align:middle line:90%
You can download it.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: And it's about
44 pages to read.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.090 align:middle line:90%
It takes about four hours.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
On February 6,
there was a meeting

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that happened between me, a
few other members, and people

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.360 align:middle line:90%
of TLS.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was led by one of the
heads of the organization.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a person or
organization who is--

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:90%
was/is one of the leaders.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:90%
His name is Rabbi AA.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrew, it's
Rabbi Aleph Aleph,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:84%
which is the first letter
of the Hebrew alphabet.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Those are his
initials of his name.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
His full name is Rabbi
Eliezer Alfrandi.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Eliezer in Hebrew
spelled with an Aleph.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So the translation was AA, even
though Eliezer is with an E.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
On that date, it was me, the
person who first approached me,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and a few others that
were sitting down.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And the rabbi was
speaking to us.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, just to make it
clear, this is not

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:90%
a religious organization.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with religion.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with race.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.250 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Are they spiritual?

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.050 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Absolutely.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: They are.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.170 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So there's another
head of the organization that's

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Japanese that has nothing
to do with Judaism.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:90%
He's 613 years old.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Literally.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Physical human being--

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: You've seen him?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Him, I have not.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:90%
The rabbi, I have.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:90%
The rabbi is 424 years old.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: 420-some years old?

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: 424 years.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: How does he look?

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.532 align:middle line:90%
Like a 400-year-old man?

00:09:52.532 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: How does a
400-year-old man look?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Not well.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: No, no, no.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Very well.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Very strong, very powerful.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: How has he lived so long?

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: I guess through--

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he's gone through some
version of the barakah process,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.630 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: And he's a human being.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Human being.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Human being.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Listen, let's put it this way.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:84%
If you want to speak
logically, if today we

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:84%
can live till 100 years old
with toxic water, toxic food,

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
toxic air, and so many stresses
around us like radiation

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and so on and we can
still live to 100, then

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
what makes you
think if you don't

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:84%
have all those
toxicities in your life,

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:90%
you can't live till 400?

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: I just had a story
about a Japanese fellow who's

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
117 years old and
245 days, and he's

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be the oldest
human being alive today.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Reported.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Why doesn't anybody know
about someone like this rabbi?

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So again, I
asked the same question.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Why don't these-- there's
a different question.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Why don't these people come
out and show themselves?

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's not foolproof, because
where is his birth certificate,

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know--

00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Good point.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.330 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: I don't have
his birth certificate.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you that I know
that he was born in 15--

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.048 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: You would not
bet the ranch he was

00:11:05.048 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:90%
400-some years old, would you?

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Well, because
of my experience

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:84%
with the organization, certain
things that I've seen and gone

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:84%
through, that
doesn't surprise me.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
That's not the-- that's
not the wow factor.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:90%
That's just, OK.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:90%
He's 424 years old.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.708 align:middle line:84%
And when you see and understand
the power that this man has,

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
it's not a far-fetched
thing anymore.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What did they
expect from you, Jason?

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: I wasn't
supposed to be, according

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:84%
to my knowledge at
least, the person that's

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.645 align:middle line:90%
doing this right now.

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
In that meeting on February 6,
the rabbi told the person who

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.662 align:middle line:84%
wrote "The Pyramid Code"
to write and he said,

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:45.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving you-- these were--

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing,
but the words were,

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you permission to
document your first incarnation

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:84%
in the year 2448, according
to the Hebrew calendar, which

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:84%
is about 1,300 and something
BC in ancient Egypt.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm giving you permission to
document your first incarnation

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:84%
with the condition that you
also write down "The Pyramid

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Code" without the code.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What is
"The Pyramid Code?"

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: OK.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So the document that is referred
to as "The Pyramid Code"

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
that you can download
and read is a combination

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
of this man's first incarnation
with very, very in-depth

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
memory, with details
of certain things

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:90%
that happened over his lifespan.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, by the way,
according to the document,

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:90%
he lived 936 years old.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Jeez.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Now, if you
do go to the Bible,

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:84%
everybody lived till 900
years old before Noah's Ark.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
After Noah's Ark, everybody
started living till 120, 150,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if you
look at what changed,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
they went from pure, raw
vegans to meat eaters.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.425 align:middle line:84%
The pharaohs and people
in ancient Egypt of races

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:90%
that we'll speak of--

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.467 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And they didn't have
vitamins and supplements

00:13:02.467 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:90%
in those days either.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.440 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: They didn't
need those things.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Huh.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: You're talking about
high vibrational beings.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Does the code explain
how the pyramids were built?

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So the code explains
many things.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:84%
This person happened to be
there, so he experienced this--

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: And is still anonymous.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: And will remain
anonymous for various reasons

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:90%
that I can cover as well.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:90%
But pretty much--

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So in the year 2750
BC, there were four--

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:84%
this is all in the
document, by the way.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.140 align:middle line:84%
There were four races that came
from different star systems--

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know
exactly which ones--

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
that came from four different
star systems to Earth

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:90%
for two reasons.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Reason number one was because
their planets were destroyed.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Their planets were destroyed.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:90%
They had to find a new home.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Reason number two,
their mission was

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:84%
to elevate the low
vibrational human race that

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:90%
existed on Earth at the time.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
When I say low
vibrational, I'm talking

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.112 align:middle line:84%
about a race that
had incest and murder

00:14:03.112 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and rape as a common thing
in their day-to-day lives.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.487 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Has anything changed?

00:14:06.487 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: [LAUGHS] No.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Not so much.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
we're talking about.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And they will explain
why things didn't change.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So these high vibrational beings
of those four different star

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:84%
systems came here
to also raise us up,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and they did a very good
job in the beginning.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.910 align:middle line:84%
But over time, I guess you
can say we corrupted them,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and our influence was
imposed upon them.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: We did this to them?

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: The beings
at the time, right?

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:84%
That were pretty
much human beings.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:90%
So instead of us--

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
instead of them bringing us
up, we brought them down,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:84%
and our world looks
the way that it looks.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So in turn, what's
really being said

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
here is that I know that there
are many theories that we're

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:90%
the offspring of extraterres--

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
the breeding of extraterrestrial
life and human beings,

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:90%
and that's exactly what we are.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:90%
And I'll take it a step further.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
Earth, many people

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:84%
are like, well, that's a little
far-fetched, don't you think?

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:90%
And I ask--

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I ask a very simple question.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go to the
common narrative that's

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:90%
taught to us in school today.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
The common narrative
today says that we

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:84%
were this little bacteria
that turned into a fish that

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.320 align:middle line:84%
turned-- that somehow grew legs,
started breathing out of water

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
in air, turned into some
form of lizard, eventually

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:84%
into some sort of mammal,
and then to a human being.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And after all of that, we have
all these different races.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But yet, everything
that I just said

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:84%
isn't extinct, which is how
evolution is supposed to work.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So you tell me what
sounds crazier,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:84%
the fact that I came from a
fish, which is the accepted

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.902 align:middle line:84%
narrative today, or the
fact that maybe we're

00:15:59.902 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
the offspring of
beings that looked

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:90%
like us in the first place.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
about that that I'll say

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
is if you look at Earth, how
do you think we're so diverse?

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you think there's
African Americans and Asians

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and white people and
Hispanics, and some are short

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:90%
and some are tall?

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.505 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: I think they're from all
different planetary systems.

00:16:19.505 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: And the Hebrew word
for Earth, the biblical Hebrew

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.630 align:middle line:90%
word for Earth is Tevel.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Tevel means-- T-E-V-E-L.
Tevel means a mix of spices.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
We're the only planet
that's not homogeneous.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What do they want
us to learn, to know?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: TLS?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Yes.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: That's a great question.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate goal
is to bring us,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I would say, very much
close to the awareness

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:90%
that ETs are at today.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
There are extraterrestrial
races upon us.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Some of them work in TLS.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of them I know
of that work in TLS

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:84%
from different planets
that exist today.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Some of them look
like human beings.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:90%
Some of them don't.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And their purpose overall is
to reach what you and I spoke

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:84%
about a different time
called the age of love,

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:84%
which is a different
era, different awareness

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:90%
collectively.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a collective awareness
that will pretty much lead

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.130 align:middle line:84%
us to live in a completely
different world, a world

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:90%
without borders, without walls.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no separate anything.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:90%
We're one.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And beyond-- there's no
Americans and Chinese people.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:90%
There's Earthlings, right?

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And beyond just that,
we live in a universe.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So for us to reach our
collective destiny,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:84%
collective doesn't just mean
collective upon the human race.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Collective destiny
of the age of love

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:90%
means collective upon all life.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't reach that,
then even though the ETs are

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
at a much higher level
of awareness than we are,

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.420 align:middle line:84%
we will not collectively
reach what we need to reach.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So part of their,
from my understanding,

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
motivation for being here and
for working on Earth today

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.420 align:middle line:84%
is to help us together reach
our collective awareness

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:90%
of all life in the universe.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.048 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Where are
they based, Jason?

00:18:23.048 --> 00:18:23.848 align:middle line:90%
Generally.

00:18:23.848 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Where are they all--

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Who?

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: This TLS group.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.112 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: All over the world.

00:18:28.112 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
There are offices
in New York City.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.100 align:middle line:90%
You just won't see TLS.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:90%
You'll see covers.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a cover.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:84%
But they do have a major branch
in every city in the world.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Every major city.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.228 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: "The Pyramid
Code" document, is it

00:18:39.228 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:90%
available to the general public?

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So on September 9 at
9:00 AM Eastern Standard

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Time, which is New York
time, I was instructed

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:90%
to release the document.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:84%
It's on my website,
jasonshurka.com.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I think at this point,
if I'm not mistaken,

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
there's seven or eight
different languages

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
that it's been translated
into because people

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
have been taking incredible
initiatives to work

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:90%
together and come--

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.333 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What's been
the reaction to it?

00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Incredible.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
There are those that maybe want
to put me in a mental asylum.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Really?

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.240 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:90%
My family being one of them.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.783 align:middle line:90%
They just don't believe you?

00:19:20.783 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: It's not that.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe somebody
could be manipulating me.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe-- maybe--

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Or manipulating
them, your family.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Maybe.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:90%
So listen, in the beginning--

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you the
truth-- it bothered me.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:84%
But over time, the more I
observed their reaction--

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:84%
in general, not just family,
but people and friends also that

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:84%
didn't believe
what was going on--

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
it allowed me to grow a
different level of compassion,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:90%
because I understand.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
If you put yourself in their
shoes, they live in a world

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:90%
where they don't think alien.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: So on the outside looking
in, they probably are saying,

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:84%
what happened to our
little boy Jason, right?

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Exactly.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, listen.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I understand where
they're coming from.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
In their minds,
aliens don't exist.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:84%
High tech-- the only
technology we have

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:90%
is the technology that we see.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:90%
That's how they think.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.693 align:middle line:90%
So for them to--

00:20:14.693 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: That we're alone
in this vast universe.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Exactly.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So for them to believe
me would really

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:84%
mean for them to
accept that everything

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.983 align:middle line:84%
that they think is a lie, and
that's very difficult to do.

00:20:24.983 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So I don't take it
personally, because I

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:84%
understand the
hardship that comes

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.480 align:middle line:90%
with accepting these things.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a change of
life completely.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Do you wish you would
never have been approached?

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.345 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Absolutely not.

00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: You're glad you did.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Absolutely.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: You think they knew
you wanted to be part of this?

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.435 align:middle line:90%
They felt this?

00:20:45.435 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: You're
talking about TLS?

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:47.740 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
When I asked them, why are
you coming to me-- listen,

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:55.450 align:middle line:84%
on paper, when you look at me,
you know, I'm 23 years old.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I work in real estate.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:58.385 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:20:58.385 --> 00:20:59.285 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:20:59.285 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do anything.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a--

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a big impact.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not significant
in the world.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:90%
So why me?

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.340 align:middle line:90%
That was my question.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Over time, the main
answer was, you

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:84%
were born with
something energetically

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and you will come to
understand what that means.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.640 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Did you write
your two books before

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.848 align:middle line:90%
or after you were approached?

00:21:17.848 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: That's a good question.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:90%
After.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.575 align:middle line:90%
After.

00:21:21.575 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: That gave
you the insight.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:23.420 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Not so much.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.140 align:middle line:84%
The second-- both
books, I always

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
said I didn't write
these, because I remember

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:84%
when I was typing them, it
happened in a span of a week,

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:90%
and it was done.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.027 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: That's amazing.

00:21:34.027 --> 00:21:36.708 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: And I kept saying
to my family, I didn't write

00:21:36.708 --> 00:21:38.000 align:middle line:90%
this book, because I'm typing--

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.340 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Most take two years.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It was within a few
days, and it was over.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:90%
The interesting part is that--

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.300 align:middle line:84%
so in "The Pyramid
Code" there's a book

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:90%
referred to as "Rays of Light."

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.070 align:middle line:84%
"Rays of Light" is
an 864-page book

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
written by the same man who
wrote "The Pyramid Code," only

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:84%
"Rays of Light" is not going to
be released for many reasons.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: I only had the honor of
reading about 50-some odd pages

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.060 align:middle line:90%
of the 864 pages.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, I read that after
I wrote my second book,

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:10%
and here's the amazing part.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.460 align:middle line:10%
When I wrote my second book,
it was back in February.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Language of Energy."

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was writing,
writing, writing quickly.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And only after when I
finished, they told me, hey.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to read you a
portion of "Rays of Light."

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, nobody saw my
book at this point.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.280 align:middle line:90%
They opened the book.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Start reading it to me,
because it's also in Hebrew.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for me to
read Hebrew, but I'm learning.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.308 align:middle line:84%
And there are portions in
the 50-some-odd pages that's

00:22:40.308 --> 00:22:42.350 align:middle line:84%
exactly what I wrote in
"The Language of Energy,"

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.373 align:middle line:90%
almost word for word.

00:22:43.373 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: How does that happen?

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: It's some
sort of download.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.360 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Something.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Automatic
writing through you.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: And it was weird.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:90%
But it was an experience that--

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:90%
this is new to me.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't channel.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not something that I know.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:90%
It's things that I'm learning.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I come from a very common
or average sort of place

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:90%
in terms of awareness, you know?

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Where I don't live in
a place like Boulder

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:84%
that I found to be very
aware for the most part.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: It is.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Where I'm
from, people are just

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:84%
like everybody
else in the world.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just, eh, aliens?

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, the purpose
of TLS, their mission

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
is to bring us to this
new level of awareness

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
with as little
damage as possible.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Can we handle the truth?

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: I guess we're
seeing that right now.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.800 align:middle line:90%
The truth is coming out.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: I mean, look
what happens with just

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:84%
you with people
that deal with you.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.020 align:middle line:90%
They question you.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:90%
They want to lock you up.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: A few.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Put you away.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:45.860 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: A few.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.470 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: So what happens if
we do this with the masses?

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.740 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: That's why
I don't think--

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:84%
when TLS said people
are ready, I'm

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:84%
a very big advocate
of disclosure.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of people see
secrecy as something negative,

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:90%
and it's not.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.118 align:middle line:84%
It could be something negative
if used by the wrong people.

00:24:05.118 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: And how it's used.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But on the other side of the
equation, if too much is given,

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:16.280 align:middle line:84%
too much good also and
knowledge is given too quickly,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:90%
it can do damage also.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.880 align:middle line:90%
It can cause chaos.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And my individual
example and experience

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
of how I was disclosed
to the information

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:90%
is a perfect example of that.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
If somebody came
to me and told me

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.087 align:middle line:84%
what they told me a year
later on the same day

00:24:31.087 --> 00:24:33.253 align:middle line:84%
that they approached me, I
would have looked at them

00:24:33.253 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:90%
and say, no way, you know?

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:90%
This is-- get out of here.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:90%
But disclosure happens.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it happens when
people are ready to receive

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.190 align:middle line:90%
the information.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And my biggest motivation
for coming out,

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:48.430 align:middle line:84%
even though people may look
at me like there's something

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
wrong with me or I need
to go to a mental asylum

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:84%
or maybe I'm on some drugs
or whatever it may be,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:84%
no matter what,
my main motivation

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
is because I understand that we
can bring a better age for all

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:90%
of life a whole lot quicker.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But steps need to
be taken to do that,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.570 align:middle line:90%
and sacrifices have to be made.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And if it means that we
can even bring ourselves

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:18.420 align:middle line:84%
one minute closer to
a collective higher

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:84%
level of awareness for
our life in the universe

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and I have to sacrifice my name
and my reputation for that,

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:84%
you better believe
I'm going to do it,

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.380 align:middle line:84%
because that's more
important than I am.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Jason, in this document
that you have released,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
it talks about items hidden
under the Dome of the Rock.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:90%
What are those items?

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:41.280 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Those items were
hidden around the year 410 BC,

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.530 align:middle line:84%
according to the
orders of King Josiah

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:84%
at the time by the
person who wrote

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.150 align:middle line:84%
the document in his past
life, in that incarnation.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the story
that's being told.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose for
hiding these items, which

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll explain what they are--

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Please.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: --was to-- so these
items, which are very powerful

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and sacred items, don't get into
the hands of the wrong people.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if it does, it could
lead to a lot of problems.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Such as war?

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Such as
very high technology

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.143 align:middle line:84%
being in hands
that can be very--

00:26:10.143 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: With a lot of people.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Exactly.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So hidden under the Dome of
the Rock-- and by the way,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:84%
it's called the Dome of the Rock
because right under the dome,

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:84%
which today is an
Islamic shrine, mosque--

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.720 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: In Jerusalem.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.595 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: In Jerusalem.

00:26:25.595 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:84%
It's right next to
the Western Wall.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Right under the dome, there
is actually a massive boulder.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And that boulder they
call the foundation stone.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:84%
They call it the foundation
stone because that--

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:84%
it's not only the
energetic center of Earth,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
it's also the energetic
center of the universe.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So Earth plays a very
important role in the universe

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on here.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Hidden directly under it,
100 and some odd feet--

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the
exact measurements

00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:84%
of where it is-- is a room where
there's the Holy of Holies,

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:84%
There are two staffs,
very much like what you

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:90%
see in Egyptian hieroglyphics.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: From Moses, maybe?

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Moses, by
the way, was born--

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:84%
raised by the pharaohs
in the royal palace.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:84%
He got a lot of his
powers from what

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.240 align:middle line:84%
is called the barakah process,
which is an initiation

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.615 align:middle line:84%
process that pretty
much only the pharaohs

00:27:20.615 --> 00:27:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and their offspring go through,
but there were some exceptions,

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Moses being one of them because
he was a Jew that was adopted

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:90%
by the pharaoh's daughter.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So that stick-- there's
two sticks-- staffs,

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.800 align:middle line:90%
we'll call them.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:84%
One is-- it has the
head of a snake on it.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
called the ankh,

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
which is the cross
with the loop on top.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:84%
That's I think known
as the stick of life.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: These are all biblical
things that we've heard about.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.990 align:middle line:90%
The Bible is the history book.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: And it's all there.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Mm-hmm.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.445 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Now, we're going to go by
Skype to talk to remote viewer

00:27:52.445 --> 00:27:54.632 align:middle line:90%
Patricia Monna.

00:27:54.632 --> 00:27:59.330 align:middle line:10%
And one of her clients
asked her to remote view

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:10%
the Dome of the Rock as
we've been talking about it.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.310 align:middle line:10%
Patricia, you're live in Canada.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.130 align:middle line:10%
Welcome.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:10%
MONNA: Hi.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much
for having me again.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Tell us
about this episode.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:90%
How did this client come to you?

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:15.980 align:middle line:84%
What did they want you
to try to remote view?

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:10%
MONNA: Well, I was
asked to remote view

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:10%
some ancient technologies, some
artifacts, and some targets.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:10%
And so the type of
remote viewing that I do,

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:33.660 align:middle line:10%
I track energy, whether it's a
missing person or even a place

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.177 align:middle line:10%
or thing in the entire universe.

00:28:35.177 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:10%
That's what the gift
of remote viewing does.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:10%
It gives you the ability to
be able to perceive outside

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:10%
of this reality and
across the world.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:10%
So when I was looking
under the Dome of the Rock,

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:10%
the first thing that I noticed
was the conflicting energy.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:10%
The energy that is on
top of that specific site

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:10%
is not the same
resonance as what's

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.980 align:middle line:10%
coming up from the bottom.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:04.320 align:middle line:10%
So without knowing any
sort of history on the Dome

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:10%
of the Rock--

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:10%
I didn't even know
where it was--

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:12.350 align:middle line:10%
I was able to see that there
would be fights in the area,

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.500 align:middle line:10%
that there should be,
due to the conflicting

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.370 align:middle line:10%
energy on a personal
level as human beings,

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:10%
we're going to feel that fight.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Did you see the
Ark of the Covenant?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.500 align:middle line:10%
MONNA: I saw quite a
few things down there.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.790 align:middle line:10%
The first thing that I saw
was a spiral staircase that

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.610 align:middle line:10%
went all the way to the bottom.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:10%
I also saw an alcove
that looked like a room.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:10%
One of them had an altar in it.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:10%
I remember seeing the staffs
that Jason spoke about.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.820 align:middle line:10%
I saw two staffs down there.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:10%
And I do confirm that one did
look like it had a snake's had.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:10%
It was the snake-- the
shape of a snake's head.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:10%
I did see that.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one
did look like the ankh.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.070 align:middle line:10%
And what I noticed
was with these staffs

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.060 align:middle line:10%
comes a very specific resonance.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:10%
So I know that the
person who put them there

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:10%
had to vibrate a certain level
in order to touch these things.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:18.170 align:middle line:10%
It was all about resonance, even
down to what these people ate.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:84%
The reason why they
could live longer

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
was because of what
they would eat.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:10%
I saw this manna bread
that was down there.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.750 align:middle line:10%
And when I looked
a little closer,

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:10%
I saw the residence of
monoatomic gold, which

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:36.980 align:middle line:10%
is something that the ancients
used to ingest to bring up

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:10%
their personal vibration,
because the higher you vibrate,

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:10%
there's no disease
that you will catch.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:10%
There's no open doors
for negative things

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:10%
to come in, right?

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.770 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, the
body is more pure.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.980 align:middle line:10%
Everything about the energetic
field and what it projects

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.240 align:middle line:10%
is more pure.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:10%
And with that comes a higher
degree of intelligence,

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.922 align:middle line:10%
or I guess cosmic intelligence.

00:31:02.922 --> 00:31:04.130 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Jason, any questions--

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.450 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.800 align:middle line:10%
It's very interesting
that you say that,

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:10%
because you just
connected something

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.240 align:middle line:10%
that isn't spoken about
anywhere that I happen

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.390 align:middle line:10%
to know of from Rabbi
AA and certain things

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.310 align:middle line:10%
that he said in the past.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:10%
So that manna bread, in the
Bible they call it [HEBREW]

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.960 align:middle line:10%
in Hebrew.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason-- in the story
of the Bible, the Hebrews,

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:29.570 align:middle line:84%
before they became the Jewish
people to when they received

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.678 align:middle line:90%
the Torah on Mount Sinai--

00:31:31.678 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:90%
which, by the way, is Mt.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.790 align:middle line:10%
Karkom today in Israel--

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:10%


00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.990 align:middle line:10%
they had to eat that bread for
a period of time and nothing

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.790 align:middle line:10%
else.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:47.900 align:middle line:10%
And Rabbi AA said that
the purpose for that

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.270 align:middle line:10%
is exactly what you just
said, which is interesting.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:10%
And I know that we've
never shared that before,

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.420 align:middle line:10%
which is awesome.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:10%
The purpose of the bread is to
purify the body, mind, and soul

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.813 align:middle line:10%
on all levels, to be able
to bring the individual

00:32:01.813 --> 00:32:03.230 align:middle line:10%
to get to the point
where they can

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.600 align:middle line:10%
receive something of such high
vibration in the first place.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.010 align:middle line:10%
So I mean, you hit
it right on the nail.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.880 align:middle line:10%
I had a question for you.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:10%
Did you see any
sculptures of any sort?

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Because there are certain
references that are brought up.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:10%
MONNA: Yes, I did.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:10%
I saw two of them,
one that looked

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:10%
like it was a combination
of an animal and a person.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:10%
So one looked like an eagle
and then the head of a man.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:10%
And then the other
one, again, it didn't--

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:10%
the second one, though, didn't
look like an eagle to me.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.520 align:middle line:10%
The second energy felt almost
like it had a feminine--

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:10%
it felt like it was the
divine feminine coming

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.500 align:middle line:10%
through that one and
the masculine coming

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.370 align:middle line:10%
through the other.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:57.820 align:middle line:10%
It felt like it had equal
but different energy.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:10%
They were not the same--

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:02.978 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: Yeah, which is exactly
in the document, it said--

00:33:02.978 --> 00:33:04.520 align:middle line:10%
they're called
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.633 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's
an English name for that.

00:33:06.633 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,
as it says in the document,

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:13.593 align:middle line:84%
are two sculptures,
two sort of statues.

00:33:13.593 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:10%
Both of them have the
heads of an eagle,

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:10%
but one has a feminine
body and the other one

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.225 align:middle line:10%
has a masculine body.

00:33:20.225 --> 00:33:23.660 align:middle line:10%
So [LAUGHS] it's interesting.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.890 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Patricia, Thank you.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a remarkable
work that you've done.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.520 align:middle line:10%
MONNA: Thank you.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.780 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: Thank you so much.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.025 align:middle line:10%
MONNA: You're so welcome.

00:33:31.025 --> 00:33:32.400 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: You take
care of yourself.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.250 align:middle line:10%
What do you think,
Jason, the significance

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.460 align:middle line:10%
of the Dome of the Rock is?

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.647 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Again, I
think its importance--

00:33:38.647 --> 00:33:40.480 align:middle line:84%
first of all, there are
some things about it

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:90%
that I don't know.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know is that
it is the energetic center

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.810 align:middle line:90%
of Earth and the universe.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, before the Dome of the
Rock was the Dome of the Rock,

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.040 align:middle line:84%
just like the Egyptians
knew to build pyramids

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.200 align:middle line:90%
on certain lay lines--

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.800 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Right.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a purpose
that the Hebrews

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:84%
at the time who built the
holy temple, the Jews,

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:84%
built it around that
foundation stone.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's because somehow they
were in some sort of resonance

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and in tune to the extent
where they could understand

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:84%
that that part of Earth is
very significant energetically.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So they built the
temple around it.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.485 align:middle line:84%
Now Patricia, by
the way, brought

00:34:19.485 --> 00:34:20.610 align:middle line:90%
something very interesting.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:84%
She said that there's
conflicting energies of what's

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.850 align:middle line:90%
underground and what's on top.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: As you said.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.300 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Which is--
I mean, it used

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.909 align:middle line:84%
to be a different temple
doing different things.

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the things that
were stored from that temple

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.710 align:middle line:84%
are no longer in alignment
with what's above it.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What do you think
of the spiral staircase

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:90%
she talked about?

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:45.139 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: I asked, actually,
because it was something

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:47.239 align:middle line:90%
that I was curious about.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know of
any spiral staircase.

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of the access of
how to get to that portion.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.200 align:middle line:90%
But I do know that it--

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.832 align:middle line:84%
we're not too far from those
things perhaps being revealed.

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:02.290 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Now many
believe, of course,

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:07.080 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids were constructed by
extraterrestrials or assisted.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think they've come
to good old planet Earth?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.760 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: OK.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So again, number
one, the ones that I

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:19.140 align:middle line:84%
know of in 2750 BC, that
doesn't mean that ETs

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.160 align:middle line:84%
didn't coming here way
before then as well.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.350 align:middle line:84%
This is just a certain part
of history, a specific part.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:27.690 align:middle line:84%
But they came because their
planets were destroyed

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and to help raise
the awareness of man

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:84%
at the time, of humankind over
here, which is very much what

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.490 align:middle line:90%
they're doing today.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:39.010 align:middle line:84%
They're not here for fun because
they like how on Earth looks.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Are we in any kind
of danger in your opinion?

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.870 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: There are
threats in the universe,

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and nuclear weapons
are a big threat.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you know there is a
very big connection to suddenly

00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.420 align:middle line:84%
when there are UFO sightings,
nuclear weapon bases

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:90%
just go down.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.440 align:middle line:90%
By the way--

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.398 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: That's happened?

00:36:03.398 --> 00:36:05.730 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Yeah, that's
happened many times.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Part of what they do is
neutralize nuclear weaponry,

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:14.370 align:middle line:84%
because that has
the ability to-- it

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:84%
plays a very big threat to us
on the universal level, not just

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Modern-day humanity
does not know what you know.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.622 align:middle line:90%
Are you afraid?

00:36:25.622 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Absolutely not.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:84%
If anything, it gives
me a lot of hope.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:29.550 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: For us.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.120 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: For us.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going into a
very good direction.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.720 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: So there's light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.637 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: There's love at
the end of the tunnel,

00:36:35.637 --> 00:36:37.050 align:middle line:90%
and it's called the age of love.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What kind of
races are with us today?

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.090 align:middle line:90%
ET types?

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.510 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: I know of three.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:43.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you the names.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:47.460 align:middle line:90%
There's Konom, Nashia, and Tzia.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Tzia are the equivalent of
what people would call--

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if it's
the same exact race,

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.970 align:middle line:84%
but for me
cross-referencing what

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I know in the
community today, Tzia

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.620 align:middle line:90%
look very much like Pleiadians.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Konom, people from Konom,
look very much like the Grays.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they're the same ones.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I do know that there's an
idea that the Grays are evil.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.315 align:middle line:84%
The people from
Konom are absolutely

00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:14.190 align:middle line:90%
the opposite of that.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And Konom are the only ones that
really don't look like humans.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.660 align:middle line:84%
They're short, lengthy,
dolphin-like skin.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: All friendly?

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.300 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: All absolutely friendly.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: So we lucked out there,
because there are some races

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:30.870 align:middle line:90%
that aren't friendly.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So people say that, but
from the knowledge that I have,

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of any races
that are not friendly.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.160 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: You haven't
come across that.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: No.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.762 align:middle line:84%
And according to TLS, Earth
is the only planet with war.

00:37:42.762 --> 00:37:44.720 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: How do you think
the pyramids were made?

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:90%
What kind of technology?

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.050 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: It was a
technology that was

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.240 align:middle line:84%
brought with the
extraterrestrials at the time.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:84%
There were four races that
landed in the north, south,

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:53.870 align:middle line:90%
east, and west.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:57.650 align:middle line:84%
The race that we know is the
pharaohs were called Fatasol.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Fatasol is the sons of god, the
people that came from the sky.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.680 align:middle line:84%
They brought with
them EMP, which

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:84%
is known as
Electromagnetic Pulsation,

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and EMLP, which is
Electromagnetic Laser

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Pulsation.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:84%
These technologies--
the pyramids

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.740 align:middle line:84%
were built with two
types of technologies,

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:84%
physical technology
like what I just said

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.630 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual technology.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I mean by
spiritual technology

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:27.110 align:middle line:90%
is, for example, a UFO.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't just operate
through physical means.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not just physical
technology that, by the way,

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:37.390 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the sun
and lasers and all of that.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:42.250 align:middle line:84%
The crafts actually work
through the consciousness

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.118 align:middle line:90%
of the operator.

00:38:43.118 --> 00:38:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So the craft is an extension
of the consciousness

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.760 align:middle line:84%
of the operator, and that's
why you can see things going--

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:84%
you can see movements that
don't make sense physically.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramids were
built with very much

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.870 align:middle line:84%
of the same technology, and they
were built for the purpose--

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.320 align:middle line:90%
many purposes.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.490 align:middle line:84%
It was an eternal clock,
an eternal calendar.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:08.350 align:middle line:84%
They were mainly built
for protection of what

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:10.390 align:middle line:90%
was being stored inside it.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:84%
There were many-- there
were some crafts that

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.320 align:middle line:90%
were stored inside it.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And there were also certain
instruments and tools

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to preserve
for generations to come.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So the protection-- number
one, the shape of the pyramid

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is, by the way, the best way to
preserve something naturally,

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.170 align:middle line:90%
structurally.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the
physical protection,

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:37.630 align:middle line:84%
EMP and EMLP in the
Fatasol Pharaonic language

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:43.420 align:middle line:84%
was referred to as magia
or magen In Hebrew, magen

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.320 align:middle line:90%
means shield.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.770 align:middle line:90%
It's protection.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So this EMP and
electromagnetic laser pulsation

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:84%
act as protection for what's
stored under the pyramids.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So there are vast hidden
basements that we have not

00:39:58.690 --> 00:39:59.665 align:middle line:90%
found yet today.

00:39:59.665 --> 00:40:01.790 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Let's look at a
picture of a pyramid, Jason.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:02.200 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Sure.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.440 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And you tell us
about the structure of it

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and what you think is
behind the geometry.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:07.750 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Sure.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:08.650 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.900 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What can
you say about this?

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.330 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: The pyramid
is a structure

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:18.010 align:middle line:84%
that was created to link
man in the physical world

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual world.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was done
through the geometry

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking at.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.252 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: That shape is important.

00:40:24.252 --> 00:40:26.410 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: That shape did
not come because somebody

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.340 align:middle line:90%
liked the shape.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It came because of the
numbers and the way energy

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.290 align:middle line:90%
flows through that shape.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:37.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you look at the
vertices, there's one on top

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and there's four on the bottom
that make up the square.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Five vertices represents
the letter also in Hebrew--

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.050 align:middle line:84%
once again, not
Jewish, the pharaohs

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.480 align:middle line:84%
used the Hebrew
language-- the letter hei,

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.670 align:middle line:84%
which is the fifth
letter of the alphabet.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Hei represents god.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:57.100 align:middle line:84%
By the way, in every
tradition, pay attention, now.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Anything to represent
God is breath.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It takes a breath.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALE] Hei is god to show that
spirit is actually air, breath.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.290 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: That's great
geometry, though.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:10.540 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Now, the
lines there, lines

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that make up the
actual shape, there's

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:90%
four that make up the actual--

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
that make up the
walls, and there are

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.360 align:middle line:90%
four that make up the square.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Eight lines represent
infinity, and that represents

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:24.897 align:middle line:84%
the infinite flow of energy that
moved through that structure,

00:41:24.897 --> 00:41:26.605 align:middle line:84%
to connect the physical
to the spiritual.

00:41:26.605 --> 00:41:29.360 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Now, how did
they physically make it.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.530 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Great.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.900 align:middle line:90%
There was levitation of rocks.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.862 align:middle line:90%
They cut down--

00:41:33.862 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Sound resonance?

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:35.390 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Say it again.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Sound resonance?

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.500 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: I've heard that.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that they've used
electromagnetic pulsation,

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:45.520 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic laser
pulsation to cut the stones

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:90%
and to move the stones.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that advanced technology
has some sort of resonance--

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it does, because
that's how everything works.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they
actually moved the stones.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:59.900 align:middle line:84%
The pharaohs were
the architects.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.410 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrews at the time were
the builders with the technology

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.210 align:middle line:90%
of the pharaohs.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What is next for
all of us in your opinion?

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:09.960 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: OK.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we are
in the age of light.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.960 align:middle line:10%
The age of light started on the
famous date that we all know,

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.330 align:middle line:10%
December 21, 2012.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the world
didn't end, but we

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.070 align:middle line:84%
did have a very
big energetic shift

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.220 align:middle line:84%
that did cause a very big
shift in consciousness.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.760 align:middle line:84%
You see people
eating differently,

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.220 align:middle line:84%
taking care of their
health, being more aware

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.030 align:middle line:90%
of certain things.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of information is coming
to light and being exposed.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the age of
light right now.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.940 align:middle line:84%
According to TLS,
from the year 2020,

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.630 align:middle line:84%
we're exactly 170
years away, which

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:46.990 align:middle line:84%
is the deadline, of what's
called the age of love which

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:50.060 align:middle line:90%
is, again, a time of no borders.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a time of unity,
intergalactic communication.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Levitation with the body
is something that's normal.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:55.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.980 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Sounds good to me.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.060 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: --supernatural, right?

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason why
I'm doing all of this

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.110 align:middle line:84%
is because of what
I'm about to say.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to say the age of
love deadline is in 170 years,

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.350 align:middle line:90%
but here's the beautiful part.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to wait till then
in order to reach that point.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.240 align:middle line:84%
The age of love
corresponds to a time

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.080 align:middle line:84%
where we're all collectively
in fifth dimensional awareness

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.990 align:middle line:90%
or higher.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:30.470 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm OK
with coming especially

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.050 align:middle line:84%
from the place that I
come from and being OK

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.150 align:middle line:84%
with the ridicule
and all of that

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.610 align:middle line:84%
is because we can
bring the age of love

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:90%
upon us in our lifetime.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:44.660 align:middle line:84%
It will come in 170 years,
which is in the year 2000--

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.483 align:middle line:90%
2192, I believe.

00:43:47.483 --> 00:43:48.400 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: 2190-something.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.100 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: 2192, I
think, from 2012.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.085 align:middle line:90%
That's the deadline.

00:43:53.085 --> 00:43:55.210 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what's
going to happen on the way?

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what happens, we're
going to get there by then.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:01.210 align:middle line:84%
We could get there
in our lifetime.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:03.490 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that this
document, "The Pyramid

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:07.270 align:middle line:10%
Code," whether it brings us a
minute closer, an hour closer,

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:10.120 align:middle line:10%
or a year closer,
or 100 years closer,

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.957 align:middle line:10%
it's one step in
the right direction,

00:44:11.957 --> 00:44:13.540 align:middle line:10%
and that's why I'm
standing behind it.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.610 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And how can people
download the document?

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:17.872 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: It's on my
website, jasonshurka.com.

00:44:17.872 --> 00:44:19.330 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Spell your
last name for us.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:24.160 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: S-H-U-R-K-A. There's a
tab that says The Pyramid Code.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.840 align:middle line:10%
You can download it
in your language.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.460 align:middle line:90%
It's in many languages now.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are audio
versions if you

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.900 align:middle line:84%
don't want to read it
in English and Hebrew

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.920 align:middle line:90%
on my YouTube channel.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.510 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Jason, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:35.270 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Thank you so much.

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.680 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.880 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: You've got
guts, my friend.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.720 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: [LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.470 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Stay safe.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:39.270 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Thank you.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.790 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Fascinating discussion
about "The Pyramid Code,"

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:45.700 align:middle line:10%
about this
organization called TLS

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:48.340 align:middle line:10%
that wants to better mankind.

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.720 align:middle line:10%
I hope they do.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
