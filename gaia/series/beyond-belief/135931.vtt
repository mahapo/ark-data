00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:22.325 align:middle line:84%
[THEME MUSIC] >>GEORGE NOORY:
Welcome to this edition

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:23.148 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.943 align:middle line:84%
What a program we
have in store for you.

00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
intuitiveness and predictions.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Time is neither
linear nor unchangeable.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.163 align:middle line:84%
That's according to intuitive
consultant and energy healer

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.331 align:middle line:90%
Cyndi Dale.

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:41.291 align:middle line:84%
Drawing on her
understanding of physics

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.919 align:middle line:84%
and mystical
traditions, she teaches

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
people to look into the
past, to heal wounds,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.509 align:middle line:84%
and to examine parallel
futures to weigh choices.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.929 align:middle line:84%
Cyndi has assisted more
than 65,000 individuals

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.266 align:middle line:84%
and organizations over
the past 25 years.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.519 align:middle line:84%
She explains how to tap into
our clairvoyant abilities.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Today on "Beyond Belief."
>>NOORY: As you just heard,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.441 align:middle line:90%
Cyndi Dale is with us.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.361 align:middle line:84%
She is an intuitive
consultant and a healer.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.488 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
she has her finger

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:14.032 align:middle line:90%
on the pulse of the future.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.284 align:middle line:90%
Cyndi, welcome to the program.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:15.617 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI DALE: Thank you.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.035 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to be here.

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are so
delightful these days.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.831 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Well, thank you.

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:23.041 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looking at
things in the future.

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.418 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, and
everybody wants

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.128 align:middle line:84%
to know about their
future, don't they?

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:29.923 align:middle line:84%
That is in my practice the
single most important question

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.967 align:middle line:84%
or set of questions
that people ask.

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.294 align:middle line:90%
What do I see in their future?

00:01:33.294 --> 00:01:34.094 align:middle line:90%
What's to come?

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.388 align:middle line:84%
What might happen,
what shouldn't happen?

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:37.973 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people
really want to know

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen to
themselves in the future?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.727 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Unfortunately, yes.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good or bad?

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.856 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They don't really
want to know what's bad.

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:49.362 align:middle line:84%
And so I have to be very
cautious if I do get insight.

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:51.862 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the thing is
when you're working intuitively,

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:54.823 align:middle line:84%
you never know what you're
going to be shown or told.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:58.535 align:middle line:84%
And so even if somebody wants
to know what's going to occur

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.412 align:middle line:84%
or what might occur,
it doesn't mean

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:01.788 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get the answer.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.374 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it's necessarily
going to be shared with me.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:08.044 align:middle line:84%
But more often than not, I
do get inklings, maybe senses

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.172 align:middle line:90%
or pictures or feelings.

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's become something
I'm very interested in

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:90%
and I actually like researching.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:90%
You know, what is the future?

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.472 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: How does it work?

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.349 align:middle line:84%
How do we know
what might happen?

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.477 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to decide
if something, you know,

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.103 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen or not?

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:27.189 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if you
pick up stuff on people

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.901 align:middle line:84%
and it's not good, you're going
to hold back and not tell them?

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.986 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You know what I
do is I go with guidance.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.364 align:middle line:84%
I really work with
guidance, you know,

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:38.658 align:middle line:84%
my own sense of spirit, my
sense of the other person

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.327 align:middle line:90%
and who they really are.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:43.914 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I do pick up things
George, and it's uncomfortable.

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:47.542 align:middle line:84%
But I'll get kind of like a
funny feeling in my stomach

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.003 align:middle line:90%
that says it's not yours to say.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.672 align:middle line:84%
Once in a while it just
comes out of my mouth though.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.925 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago I was
working with the woman,

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
probably seven or
eight years ago.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.054 align:middle line:90%
Nice woman, three children.

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.722 align:middle line:90%
Her husband ran a company.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:02.182 align:middle line:90%
He was the sole provider.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.727 align:middle line:84%
And out of my mouth
flew the question,

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.221 align:middle line:90%
do you have life insurance?

00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:08.021 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.232 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Who wants to
be asked that question?

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:11.233 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
horrible question.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.609 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's a
horrible question.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.405 align:middle line:84%
I felt immediately traumatized
and that I was just

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.115 align:middle line:90%
traumatizing her.

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:21.118 align:middle line:84%
She came back to see me
about three years later

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.286 align:middle line:84%
and she said I
took your question.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.204 align:middle line:90%
I got life insurance.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.998 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good thing
I did, my husband

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.042 align:middle line:90%
was just diagnosed with ALS.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.252 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And in those days,
any precondition

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.422 align:middle line:90%
would not have been insurable.

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.966 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No, exactly, exactly.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.593 align:middle line:84%
You know, so I really
trust my sense of things

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.761 align:middle line:90%
if something comes to me.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.973 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's a
warning or a red flag,

00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:46.476 align:middle line:84%
if I feel like I'm supposed
to put it out there, I will.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.228 align:middle line:84%
If I don't get a sense
that I should, I don't.

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:52.232 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't want
to be a psychic spy.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.817 align:middle line:84%
It's not my business
always what's

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
going to happen in
somebody's future.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And can you tell
that from just about anybody

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.573 align:middle line:90%
you meet?

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:03.535 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I am a very normal
person in my everyday life.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.453 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure you are.

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:07.873 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: When I go to Target,
I am shopping at Target.

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:10.876 align:middle line:84%
I close down better, I
think, than most people

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:12.002 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.547 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to know
who is beating up,

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.841 align:middle line:90%
who's going to die the next day.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.135 align:middle line:90%
But you know, we're all open.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.094 align:middle line:90%
We're energetic.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.262 align:middle line:90%
We're energetic beings.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.848 align:middle line:84%
So we pick up on the
energy of other people.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.433 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, do
you feel this though

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.225 align:middle line:90%
when you're out shopping?

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.025 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:30.687 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've got all
these people walking past you.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.273 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like, oh
my god, that person.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.608 align:middle line:90%
This is going to happen to them.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:90%
And this is going happen.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.401 align:middle line:90%
Do you get that feeling?

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.819 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Once in a while.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.407 align:middle line:84%
If they're really emanating
a message or if something's

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:46.578 align:middle line:84%
impeding in their life
or if something's just

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:50.373 align:middle line:84%
about to happen, I almost
can't help but pick up on it.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.167 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's-- it
sounds kind of creepy.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.544 align:middle line:84%
But there's a certain
feeling that people have

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.588 align:middle line:90%
before they're going to die.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.423 align:middle line:84%
There's almost this
sort of white energy

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:84%
that they give off, this sort
of spiritualization process

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.886 align:middle line:90%
that occurs.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:06.598 align:middle line:84%
And that happens when somebody
is two years old or 27 years

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.725 align:middle line:90%
old or 89 years old.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:12.979 align:middle line:84%
There's just a way that
they feel or appear.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.273 align:middle line:90%
And I can pick up on that.

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.192 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
don't say anything.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.362 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go up to
somebody in a line and say,

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.322 align:middle line:90%
do you have your will done?

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.532 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you're next.

00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:25.492 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I'm not
going to do that.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.828 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the future
isn't always set in stone.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.331 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there
are possibilities.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.166 align:middle line:90%
There are probabilities.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:36.044 align:middle line:84%
And to some extent,
there are certainties.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.673 align:middle line:84%
I think there are some
things that we kind of pre

00:05:38.673 --> 00:05:40.632 align:middle line:90%
plan before we're born.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.592 align:middle line:84%
We're going to meet this
person and marry them.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.178 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I met
my oldest son's father

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.888 align:middle line:90%
we were in a seminar together.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:49.133 align:middle line:84%
I saw him and I thought,
I'm going to marry him.

00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:49.933 align:middle line:90%
I just knew it.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.726 align:middle line:84%
And I also knew I was
going to divorce him.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:52.936 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he know it?

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.396 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No.

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.147 align:middle line:90%
It took a little longer.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:57.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you also--
what do you mean you also

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.775 align:middle line:84%
knew you were going
to divorce him.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:02.487 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I also knew when I
met him I had this feeling.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:03.989 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm going to marry him.

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:05.865 align:middle line:84%
I know we'll have a
child, but I don't think

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.741 align:middle line:90%
we're going to end up together.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.532 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why did
you go through with it?

00:06:08.532 --> 00:06:10.412 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Isn't that the question?

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:12.615 align:middle line:84%
I have a great son
out of that marriage.

00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:13.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:16.751 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And I have had a
couple experiences in my life

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:21.089 align:middle line:84%
where I have this very strong
sense I needed to do something.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:24.884 align:middle line:84%
And it would be hard or parts
of it might be quite lovely,

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.596 align:middle line:84%
but it wouldn't end up
looking the way that people

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.347 align:middle line:90%
would say was successful.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.266 align:middle line:84%
Because doesn't that
beg the question,

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.808 align:middle line:84%
you know, why do we
do things anyway?

00:06:32.808 --> 00:06:34.769 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's for
a higher lesson.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.439 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's because
we pre agreed to do it.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.608 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's because
we're going to have a child.

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:42.694 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes because the
flaming of a business

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.738 align:middle line:84%
is what births
the next business.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So I try to be really careful
about the judgment about what

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.452 align:middle line:90%
is a pre-cognition.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.038 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's really a good
ending versus a bad ending.

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:53.079 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.789 align:middle line:84%
So you're glad you went
through it, obviously.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:55.081 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Obviously.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You go the
son out of the deal.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.787 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I have the most
amazing son, absolutely.

00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:00.587 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.797 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you stay
in touch with the ex?

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.132 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I have two exes.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.508 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.302 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that one coming too?

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.928 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not going to
pick somebody though

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.516 align:middle line:84%
until I know it's going
to work all the way.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.977 align:middle line:84%
So I have two boys from
two different marriages.

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:20.023 align:middle line:84%
And I am in touch constantly
with my 17 year old's father.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.274 align:middle line:90%
And we get along really great.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:21.566 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.568 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: We've been
divorced for 13 years.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.153 align:middle line:90%
We talk constantly.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.781 align:middle line:84%
We're the perfect
parents for this child.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.574 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, speaking
of the future,

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:32.869 align:middle line:84%
when I was five months
pregnant with my son who is

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.204 align:middle line:90%
named Gabriel, he visited me.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:35.538 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was my dad's name.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:36.915 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's a great
name, isn't it?

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:37.248 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a super name.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.332 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's a great name.

00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:39.959 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a holy name.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.253 align:middle line:90%
And Gabe appeared to me.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:46.216 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my middle name
needs to be Lucas, which it is.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:90%
He gave me three predictions.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Two were going to happen
in the next month.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.138 align:middle line:90%
His dad was a jeweler.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.849 align:middle line:84%
He told me the exact
amount of money

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.143 align:middle line:84%
his dad was going to
make on two sales.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.813 align:middle line:84%
The third prediction,
he said, I could

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.816 align:middle line:84%
be killed when I'm a
year and a half years old

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:03.983 align:middle line:90%
and the same with my father.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:04.783 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, gees.

00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Talk about wild.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.278 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird, yeah.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.739 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well what's even
weirder is those jewelry sales

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.117 align:middle line:90%
came through to the penny.

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:15.203 align:middle line:90%
So Gabe's a year and a half old.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.872 align:middle line:84%
And the prediction had showed
me a storm, that it was

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.916 align:middle line:90%
going to happen during a storm.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, the day was lovely.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.338 align:middle line:84%
And I just had this
kind of weird feeling.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:28.466 align:middle line:84%
So I called Gabe's father
and I said, where are you?

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.301 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I just picked
Gabe up from day care

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.594 align:middle line:90%
and I'm coming home.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.806 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what to say,
but I wasn't really connecting

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.224 align:middle line:90%
it to the prediction.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.476 align:middle line:84%
And I said, would
you just drive slow?

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:42.063 align:middle line:90%
The miracle is he did it.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.483 align:middle line:84%
About two seconds later
this enormous tree

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.193 align:middle line:90%
fell in their path.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:84%
It must have been five
foot in circumference.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.107 align:middle line:90%
They would have been killed.

00:08:52.107 --> 00:08:52.907 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:55.785 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Instantly, if
he hadn't slowed down.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.746 align:middle line:84%
I went to look at
the tree later.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:00.957 align:middle line:84%
And it had been struck by
lightning in recent storms.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.335 align:middle line:84%
And that was the event
that had been predicted.

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:10.216 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't-- during the
actual event, you know,

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see angels.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.472 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't kind of hearing
voices that said call him.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.432 align:middle line:90%
It was a feeling.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.392 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
important for people

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:23.521 align:middle line:84%
to really understand that
what determines the future may

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.273 align:middle line:90%
or may not be set in stone.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:26.983 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes all
we can do is just

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to our
sense of something,

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.655 align:middle line:84%
what feels right to do or not
and go with that gut feeling.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:36.534 align:middle line:84%
Because yes, sometimes for me
I get a vision, an appearance,

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.495 align:middle line:90%
a visitation, a dream.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.948 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it's just this
like weird little feeling

00:09:40.948 --> 00:09:41.748 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.249 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
great researcher,

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:46.745 align:middle line:84%
Larry Dossey, of course,
is an expert on futurism.

00:09:46.745 --> 00:09:47.545 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, he is.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.089 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he has
talked about what

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:53.593 align:middle line:84%
it's like for that mother child
relationship for predictions.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.054 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look, Cyndi.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.764 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: It's a
compelling story.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:01.476 align:middle line:84%
But is it really possible that
Lynn was experiencing something

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:04.521 align:middle line:84%
beyond everyday
motherly instinct?

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Larry Dossey thinks so.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.276 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY DOSSEY: If you look at
premonitions in the literature,

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:13.363 align:middle line:84%
the most common is that
of a mother for something

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:15.406 align:middle line:90%
happening to her baby.

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:17.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Dossey,
who wrote a book called

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:20.328 align:middle line:84%
"The Power of Premonitions,"
says they often

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.413 align:middle line:90%
come to us in our dreams.

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:25.542 align:middle line:84%
But they're by no
means ordinary dreams.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSEY: One woman
said the premonition

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.756 align:middle line:84%
dreams that turn out to be true
are lit up from the inside.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.425 align:middle line:90%
So the vividness is one clue.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:37.303 align:middle line:84%
Another clue is whether
or not they are recurrent.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:41.474 align:middle line:84%
Many of them turn out to be true
come back night after night, as

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.893 align:middle line:84%
if they're clamoring
for attention.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.854 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: He says that
along with forebodings

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:49.065 align:middle line:84%
about our children,
premonitions of disasters

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.568 align:middle line:90%
are the most common.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Larry has been on
"Coast to Coast" with me

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:54.195 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:90%
He's been a great guest, Cyndi.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.234 align:middle line:84%
And he has just illustrated
what you've gone through.

00:10:59.234 --> 00:11:00.034 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:01.369 align:middle line:90%
And he speaks about that.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And especially how
we can get dreams

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.625 align:middle line:84%
and how we connect as a
parent to our child, which

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.253 align:middle line:84%
was the story that
I was talking about.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.672 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had a
similar experience

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:13.965 align:middle line:90%
about a year and a half ago.

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:18.011 align:middle line:84%
That I had a dream, it was a one
time dream, but it was strong.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.715 align:middle line:84%
And I was shown my then 16 year
old as a Major League Baseball

00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:22.515 align:middle line:90%
player.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.393 align:middle line:84%
He is not yet a major
league baseball player,

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:28.605 align:middle line:84%
but a week after he came to
me and he said you know mom,

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.982 align:middle line:84%
I really want to become a
Major League Baseball player.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:31.774 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out of the blue.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:32.775 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Out of the blue.

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:32.942 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.111 align:middle line:84%
And he was good,
but he wasn't great.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:39.908 align:middle line:84%
And that was my stirring
to then work even harder

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.785 align:middle line:84%
to make the money
to give him what

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.622 align:middle line:84%
he needed in terms of coaching
to become an amazing baseball

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:46.456 align:middle line:90%
player.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:47.081 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he getting there?

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: He is getting there.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.542 align:middle line:84%
He has a college
scholarship for baseball.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's cool.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.003 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Nobody knew who he was.

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:54.839 align:middle line:84%
This summer he appeared
at a prospect camp.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:58.426 align:middle line:84%
Threw 88 miles an hour,
he's now at 90, 91.

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.929 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, if I
hadn't had the dream,

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.765 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have put
the energy into it

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:07.416 align:middle line:84%
to really back him the way
he needed to be backed.

00:12:07.416 --> 00:12:09.457 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cyndi, you wrote
a book called-- >>DALE:

00:12:09.457 --> 00:12:10.396 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a big book.

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "The Book of
Chakras." >>DALE: Yes.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.942 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "The Complete
Book of Chakras."

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.527 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced it was a
block from the pyramid,

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:18.529 align:middle line:90%
it was that big.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.865 align:middle line:90%
How did you get this on a plane?

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:23.326 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I checked it.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.327 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Listen to this.

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:25.955 align:middle line:84%
[BANG] >>DALE:
That is some book.

00:12:25.955 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a big book.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Isn't it?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when you talk
about chakras, what are they?

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.211 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Chakras are
subtle energy centers.

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.379 align:middle line:90%
They're organs.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:37.924 align:middle line:84%
We know we have a liver,
a gall bladder, a spleen.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.842 align:middle line:84%
Chakras aren't
really any different

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:43.471 align:middle line:84%
than our physical organs,
except they're more invisible.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:47.558 align:middle line:84%
What's magical about a subtle
energy center like a chakra,

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:52.146 align:middle line:84%
however, is it's able to convert
subtle or invisible energy,

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:55.608 align:middle line:84%
which often moves faster
than the speed of light,

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.653 align:middle line:84%
into physical energy
and vice versa.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So they're almost like
magical stars within or around

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.202 align:middle line:84%
our body, that really
are out there deciding

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.538 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen
next or picking up

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:12.375 align:middle line:84%
on information from visible
and invisible people,

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.836 align:middle line:84%
so that we can make
effective decisions.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:15.962 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everyone has them?

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:16.754 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Everyone has them.

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:17.672 align:middle line:90%
You're born with them.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:18.798 align:middle line:90%
Animals have them.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.675 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced plants have them.

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:24.512 align:middle line:84%
Any living being has these
chakras or energy centers.

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.431 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are what,
points on the body?

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They're
points in the body,

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.308 align:middle line:90%
but they look like vortexes.

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.729 align:middle line:84%
So one of the more famous
chakras is the heart chakra.

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.772 align:middle line:90%
It's located in the chest.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:39.736 align:middle line:84%
And it emanates from the body
moving forward and backward

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:40.695 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.822 align:middle line:84%
And really if we
could really honestly

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.533 align:middle line:84%
see a chakra psychically
or on a screen,

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:84%
if an x ray could ever
kind of still them,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.582 align:middle line:84%
we would see vortexes moving
through time and space.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.418 align:middle line:90%
So I love talking about chakras.

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Because they explain why
we're bigger than our body.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.799 align:middle line:84%
Why we're able to pick
up on what might happen.

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.676 align:middle line:84%
Why we're able to
read other people's

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:06.137 align:middle line:90%
feelings and needs and emotions.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:11.267 align:middle line:84%
And how we're able to project
decisions into the future.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:14.729 align:middle line:84%
And those decisions can
then draw us to them.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:20.146 align:middle line:84%
So we're constantly creating our
own future or ex ing potential

00:14:20.146 --> 00:14:22.487 align:middle line:90%
futures, because we are chakras.

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.982 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are chakras
like your aura?

00:14:24.982 --> 00:14:25.782 align:middle line:90%
Are they similar?

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.492 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Chakras create the aura.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.453 align:middle line:84%
So the way I
structurally perceive it,

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:84%
is the chakras more or less
govern the inside of our body.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.168 align:middle line:84%
And they emanate
energetic fields that

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.962 align:middle line:90%
go around the body in layers.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:43.216 align:middle line:84%
And I think of the auric
field, the subtle field

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.761 align:middle line:84%
as really an extension
of the various chakras.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:49.222 align:middle line:84%
So they are what
govern the inside,

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.224 align:middle line:84%
and then they extend
outside of us.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:54.519 align:middle line:84%
So we can pick up on
different dimensions, what's

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:56.813 align:middle line:90%
occurring in different places.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:01.984 align:middle line:84%
And that information filters
into our decision maker inside,

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:04.153 align:middle line:84%
hopefully our wise
decision maker.

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:07.365 align:middle line:84%
You know, so that we're ready
for what life has to give us.

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:10.034 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So how does somebody
who's intuitive like you

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:14.163 align:middle line:84%
pinpoint people's chakras
and know what's going on?

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.332 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I'm very visual,
which really means

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.417 align:middle line:90%
that I'm intuitively visual.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.753 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm working
with a client,

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.297 align:middle line:84%
I will get pictures in
my head that show me

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.715 align:middle line:84%
what's happening
with their energy

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:25.675 align:middle line:90%
centers or their chakras.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:26.676 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you see
them on me right now?

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.761 align:middle line:90%
You have a huge heart chakra.

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.429 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually,
interestingly enough,

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:33.975 align:middle line:84%
like going into two different
sort of angles right now.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's like while you're really
present here, at some level,

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.691 align:middle line:84%
you're also kind of thinking
about the rest of the day,

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.234 align:middle line:90%
you know, and what's to come.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:44.861 align:middle line:90%
But you do that beautifully.

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.654 align:middle line:84%
Because it's almost
like you're a second

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.407 align:middle line:90%
ahead of your interviewee.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:52.952 align:middle line:84%
Kind of sensing where we should
go next, what we should do.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.663 align:middle line:84%
And I think you probably live
your life that way as well.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.957 align:middle line:84%
Very grounded, very
here, very present.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's bring it in.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.211 align:middle line:84%
So that's just an image that
I'm getting off of your energy

00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.713 align:middle line:90%
center or your heart.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:07.466 align:middle line:84%
I think you've also really
good at manifesting.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:10.178 align:middle line:84%
So I like to look at the
back side of somebody

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.929 align:middle line:90%
and those back chakras.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:15.634 align:middle line:84%
You have the most whitest of
energies, to be really honest,

00:16:15.634 --> 00:16:16.434 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:16.934 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a good thing?

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:18.311 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's a
really good thing.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.479 align:middle line:84%
In my world, that's
the best you can do.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:23.065 align:middle line:84%
So it's white with a
little bit of gold.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.817 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me
you're constantly

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:30.198 align:middle line:84%
bringing in spiritual guidance,
spiritual perceptions, higher

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:90%
views of what's occurring.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.037 align:middle line:84%
And that little tinge of gold
that I'm seeing is global.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:38.539 align:middle line:84%
It means that you're really
here to help harmonize or create

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:39.874 align:middle line:90%
global change.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:40.833 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:41.083 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.044 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Thank you for
being here for all of us.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.796 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Predictions, let's
talk about predictions

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:49.008 align:middle line:90%
and predictions for mankind.

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Humans will
expand to the planets.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.223 align:middle line:84%
You are all probably familiar
with projects such as the Mars

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.643 align:middle line:84%
One Mission, whose intent is
to populate Mars with humans

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.853 align:middle line:90%
by 2025.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.231 align:middle line:84%
And judging by other
people's increasing interest

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
in reaching other
planets, it's safe to say

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.484 align:middle line:84%
that in the next
few hundred years,

00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:10.445 align:middle line:84%
the probability of humans
colonizing another planet

00:17:10.445 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:90%
is high.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.367 align:middle line:84%
Whether that is the right thing
to do is a whole other debate.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.911 align:middle line:84%
But just how close are
we to populating Mars

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.412 align:middle line:90%
or any other planet?

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:22.708 align:middle line:84%
And what sort of time
scale can we expect?

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.542 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that was
an interesting glimpse

00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:25.962 align:middle line:90%
of the future.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
back when we were

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.717 align:middle line:84%
kids, and that's
probably too far for you,

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.969 align:middle line:90%
of "The Jetsons," for example.

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.844 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I watched "The
Jetsons." >>NOORY: OK.

00:17:34.844 --> 00:17:36.339 align:middle line:90%
A great glimpse of the future.

00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:37.139 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:40.309 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had a
television on the wall.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.937 align:middle line:84%
And people would look
at that and go, huh?

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:44.814 align:middle line:90%
That's never going to happen.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.525 align:middle line:84%
Or cars that would
do certain things.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.402 align:middle line:84%
We're doing those
things right now.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.444 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We're doing them.

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:54.615 align:middle line:84%
Jules Verne kind of
gave us inclinations

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:84%
of what was going to
happen, submarines,

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.035 align:middle line:84%
and this and that
and the other thing.

00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:00.579 align:middle line:90%
Isaac Asimov, the sci-fi author.

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:03.082 align:middle line:84%
I think we still have things
that are supposed to come true.

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:04.458 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So how
do they get that?

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:07.044 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that they
just understand science

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:10.339 align:middle line:84%
and technology and
they can predict what

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:12.174 align:middle line:90%
these things are going to do?

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:14.927 align:middle line:84%
Or is it some gift
that they have?

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.095 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I think it's a gift.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:17.054 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Leonardo da Vinci.

00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:18.347 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I think it's a gift.

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:20.224 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
that we are each

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:22.393 align:middle line:90%
attuned in a different way.

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:24.854 align:middle line:84%
We each have a different
signature that makes us

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:90%
who we are.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.733 align:middle line:84%
So some of us are going to be
really gifted at figuring out

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:31.902 align:middle line:84%
how to throw a football and get
somebody to catch it, right.

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.321 align:middle line:84%
Which is an amazing
gift and it's

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.741 align:middle line:84%
one that can be rather
splendid on the bottom line.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:37.992 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And quite profitable.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.493 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:41.245 align:middle line:84%
You know, and some
people have the gift

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.456 align:middle line:84%
of being able to sense
what's going to happen

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.999 align:middle line:90%
or what could happen.

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:47.585 align:middle line:84%
You know, whether
that be in industry,

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:84%
in science, in spirituality,
you know, socially.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.176 align:middle line:84%
You know, it just depends
on who we really are,

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:58.763 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to tune into
or be able to pick up on.

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:02.058 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
to know that we're constantly

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:06.145 align:middle line:84%
deciding the future as we go as
individuals and as a society.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We can
change that, can't we?

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.815 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: We can
change the future.

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:13.402 align:middle line:84%
I do believe though, that
there are destiny points.

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:14.862 align:middle line:90%
That's what I call them.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:20.117 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're for a person,
an animal, a society, a culture.

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:23.329 align:middle line:84%
There's sort of these
nodes, these junction

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.289 align:middle line:84%
points that we get
to where there's

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:26.999 align:middle line:90%
many ways that we could go.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:30.252 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of
popular vote is going

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:33.798 align:middle line:84%
to decide whether that's
internal or a number of people

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.801 align:middle line:84%
together, which road that
we're going to go down.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.719 align:middle line:84%
So I like thinking
of it that way

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:40.429 align:middle line:84%
because it means
there's always hope.

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, these days
people are very nervous.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.142 align:middle line:84%
We're wondering, are we in
the throes of Armageddon.

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:47.019 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People are
uptight about everything.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:47.853 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They're uptight.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:48.687 align:middle line:90%
We're scared.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle line:84%
We can't see a way through the
pollution, the challenges that

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.609 align:middle line:90%
are hitting us.

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:56.362 align:middle line:84%
But we're not
always aware either

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:59.865 align:middle line:84%
of how many destiny points
we're going to come up to.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.325 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend,
for instance, who

00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:05.037 align:middle line:90%
has invented a brand of oil.

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.665 align:middle line:84%
You know, that you could
put a drop into a car

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.993 align:middle line:84%
and that car could
go for a year.

00:20:09.993 --> 00:20:10.793 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:12.044 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:13.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oil companies
don't want to hear that.

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:14.296 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No, they don't.

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:17.091 align:middle line:84%
And he actually has
worked for an oil company.

00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:20.302 align:middle line:84%
This is an individual who
actually scientifically

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:24.723 align:middle line:84%
has been able to change a
red apple into a green apple

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:26.142 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.894 align:middle line:84%
So there's so much
that's malleable,

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:32.523 align:middle line:84%
because energy can be shifted
from subtle to physical

00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:33.858 align:middle line:90%
and back again.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:38.446 align:middle line:84%
That all I can hope for is that
we're willing, as a society,

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:41.407 align:middle line:84%
to create or come
into destiny points.

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:45.077 align:middle line:84%
Where we can say, you know
what, we can feed everybody now.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:49.582 align:middle line:84%
Or we can populate the
stars in a way that's safe.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I think, I think literally
anything is possible.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.421 align:middle line:84%
Because there's these junctions,
there's these crossroads.

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:58.124 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what we just
saw, that prediction of Mars,

00:20:58.124 --> 00:20:58.924 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:20:59.724 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:20:59.724 --> 00:21:01.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't take
a rocket scientist

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:06.015 align:middle line:84%
to predict that one day mankind
will inhabit that planet.

00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:10.436 align:middle line:84%
So is that a prediction or
is that more common sense?

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:12.062 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I
think it would have

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:15.065 align:middle line:84%
been at a prediction
for sure when

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:18.444 align:middle line:84%
said 200 or 300 hundred years
ago, because we had never been

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.154 align:middle line:90%
on the moon, right.

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:22.072 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
it's probably both.

00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:25.993 align:middle line:84%
And I don't necessarily
discredit predictions

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:28.162 align:middle line:84%
if they are common
sensible as well.

00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:30.122 align:middle line:84%
You know, in terms
of when I have

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:33.083 align:middle line:84%
a sense of do this
versus do that, I also

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.293 align:middle line:90%
use my common sense.

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:35.503 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be logical.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:38.923 align:middle line:84%
You know, if something just
seems stupid or dangerous,

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.257 align:middle line:90%
why am I going to do it?

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:42.092 align:middle line:84%
Why am I going to
aim for that future?

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.844 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go that direction.

00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:47.348 align:middle line:84%
We're very much actors
in our own lives.

00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:50.976 align:middle line:84%
And change in
society almost always

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:55.022 align:middle line:84%
occurs because a person
steps up and says

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:57.733 align:middle line:84%
we need to go this direction,
or I have invented this,

00:21:57.733 --> 00:22:00.528 align:middle line:90%
or I have created this art form.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:03.113 align:middle line:84%
And you know, so so much
the better if there's common

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.782 align:middle line:90%
sense involved with it as well.

00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll always
remember a scene, Cyndi,

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.953 align:middle line:84%
from "A Christmas
Carol" the movie,

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:13.999 align:middle line:84%
with Scrooge looking into the
window of the Cratchit family.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.411 align:middle line:84%
And the Christmas of
the Future was with him.

00:22:16.411 --> 00:22:17.211 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:18.712 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
looking into it

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:22.174 align:middle line:84%
and they realize there's no
Tiny Tim, because he had died.

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.302 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Scrooge
looks at him and he's sad

00:22:25.302 --> 00:22:26.512 align:middle line:90%
and he's upset.

00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:31.141 align:middle line:84%
And he said, are these things
that will be or can be?

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:36.146 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically asking,
can you alter the future?

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:38.274 align:middle line:90%
Can mankind change it?

00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:42.069 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit basically
told him, it can change.

00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:44.405 align:middle line:90%
And that's what changed Scrooge.

00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:47.992 align:middle line:84%
Because the next scene he
was jovial and helping people

00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:50.286 align:middle line:84%
and giving away money and
everything else, which

00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:52.197 align:middle line:90%
was totally against who he was.

00:22:52.197 --> 00:22:52.997 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying
we can change that.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.709 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I do believe we can.

00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:59.295 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I can
control everything,

00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:01.213 align:middle line:90%
nor can anyone else.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:04.174 align:middle line:84%
We're all going to have
our time when we die.

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I get people coming
to me and saying,

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.345 align:middle line:90%
can't you cure me of cancer?

00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:10.806 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I can make an
inroad, sometimes they can,

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:11.765 align:middle line:90%
sometimes not.

00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:12.558 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They ask you that?

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:13.809 align:middle line:90%
Can you cure me of cancer?

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, absolutely.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.521 align:middle line:90%
And there's no promises.

00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:18.939 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
an oncologist now?

00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:21.025 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: No, there's no
promises anyone can make,

00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:23.235 align:middle line:90%
including an oncologist.

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.821 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded in
terms of kind of what

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:28.657 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about of
a client who came in

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:30.034 align:middle line:90%
to see me a few years ago.

00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:33.037 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually going to
go to Cuba to meet with Castro.

00:23:33.037 --> 00:23:35.205 align:middle line:90%
He was a very high up person.

00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:36.832 align:middle line:84%
He was going to
start some businesses

00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:84%
or talk to Castro about
starting some businesses.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.254 align:middle line:84%
And I was filled with
this sense of foreboding.

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.632 align:middle line:90%
And I said, just be careful.

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:46.342 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't know why.

00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:49.546 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling that
the meetings may go well.

00:23:49.546 --> 00:23:50.346 align:middle line:90%
They may not.

00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:84%
If they don't go
well, you know, just

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.017 align:middle line:90%
be very, very, very cautious.

00:23:55.017 --> 00:23:57.519 align:middle line:84%
And the only image I could see--
and he wanted me to give it

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:01.857 align:middle line:84%
to him, so I did-- was of him on
the return flight and the plane

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:03.067 align:middle line:90%
getting into some trouble.

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:05.103 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I actually saw
the plane going down.

00:24:05.103 --> 00:24:05.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, gees.

00:24:05.903 --> 00:24:08.322 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: No, I mean, I don't
like getting those pictures.

00:24:08.322 --> 00:24:12.451 align:middle line:84%
But this is a trusted client
and friend, so I shared it.

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:15.412 align:middle line:84%
Because I asked if
I share this story,

00:24:15.412 --> 00:24:18.457 align:middle line:84%
might there possibly
be a different outcome

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:21.752 align:middle line:84%
than what this picture is
showing, and I heard yes.

00:24:21.752 --> 00:24:23.462 align:middle line:90%
So he met with Castro.

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:25.172 align:middle line:90%
The event didn't go that well.

00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:28.842 align:middle line:84%
He's returning, and the
planes starts shuddering.

00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:29.677 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In air?

00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:30.552 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: In air.

00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:32.012 align:middle line:90%
Like not good.

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:34.306 align:middle line:84%
Like he could hear at
least one engine dying.

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.519 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get me to Miami fast.

00:24:36.519 --> 00:24:38.102 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, because
I'm not thinking

00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:41.647 align:middle line:84%
he's going to get like a Captain
Sully sort of touchdown here.

00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:42.775 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not in the ocean.

00:24:42.775 --> 00:24:44.233 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, you
know what he did.

00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:46.026 align:middle line:90%
He remembered us talking.

00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:47.528 align:middle line:90%
And he just started praying.

00:24:47.528 --> 00:24:49.196 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if
he believes in God.

00:24:49.196 --> 00:24:49.988 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who cares.

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the old-- >>NOORY:
He probably does now.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.533 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Now he does it.

00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:53.742 align:middle line:90%
It's the old in the trenches.

00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:54.993 align:middle line:90%
He just started praying.

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:58.914 align:middle line:84%
And he felt like some being
he would describe as an angel,

00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:01.875 align:middle line:90%
came underneath the plane.

00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:05.254 align:middle line:84%
And the engine that he
heard going out was restored

00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:07.381 align:middle line:90%
and they were fine.

00:25:07.381 --> 00:25:09.883 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe the plane
would have gone down

00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:13.554 align:middle line:84%
if he hadn't had that
sense of a forewarning.

00:25:13.554 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And if he hadn't thought of
in the moment, what can I do?

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.934 align:middle line:84%
Which is nothing
except ask for help.

00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:20.686 align:middle line:90%
So we don't ever know.

00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:23.313 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what's really
going to happen and what's not.

00:25:23.313 --> 00:25:27.276 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that we can
let ourselves be in the moment

00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:29.778 align:middle line:90%
and ask, what are my choices?

00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:31.363 align:middle line:90%
What am I called to do?

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:34.366 align:middle line:84%
What am I supposed to
do with this situation?

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.161 align:middle line:84%
I was doing my son's
paper route with him,

00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:40.748 align:middle line:84%
which means I usually did his
paper route a few years ago.

00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:43.667 align:middle line:90%
Hot, sweaty, we each had a dog.

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:45.544 align:middle line:90%
We're going across this street.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we made $12
each time we did this.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.843 align:middle line:84%
I probably spent $20 hiring
help each time we did this.

00:25:52.843 --> 00:25:55.095 align:middle line:84%
I just heard this
voice screaming

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:58.015 align:middle line:90%
in my head that said stop him.

00:25:58.015 --> 00:25:59.933 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't question it.

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:03.228 align:middle line:84%
I just yelled at Gabe who was
maybe fifth grade, that time.

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:90%
I said stop.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.232 align:middle line:84%
And he stopped before
he crossed the street.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.151 align:middle line:84%
And a car just came
barreling by him.

00:26:09.151 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.695 align:middle line:90%
We've all had that happen to us.

00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:13.113 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: We've all
had that happen.

00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:14.867 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
trust those moments.

00:26:14.867 --> 00:26:16.241 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
to react to it.

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:17.326 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You have to react.

00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:22.623 align:middle line:84%
And you can't take the
time to ask for well, you

00:26:22.623 --> 00:26:24.166 align:middle line:90%
know, what do you mean by that?

00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:26.502 align:middle line:90%
You just do what's there.

00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:28.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend
Clif High, who heads up

00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:30.255 align:middle line:84%
what is called the
Web Bots, has made

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:34.301 align:middle line:84%
a history of collecting
data off the internet,

00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:35.719 align:middle line:90%
off the internet chatter.

00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:38.881 align:middle line:84%
And he's able to put that
together and make predictions.

00:26:38.881 --> 00:26:39.681 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Wow.

00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:41.892 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:26:41.892 --> 00:26:44.603 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: In 1997,
Clif High discovered

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:47.397 align:middle line:84%
that his simple
invention, the Web Bot,

00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:50.359 align:middle line:84%
was picking up more than
the stock market trends.

00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:84%
It was compiling complicated
human emotional algorithms.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:84%
By monitoring news articles,
blogs, social media,

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.328 align:middle line:84%
and other forms of
chatter, Clif High

00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%
believes that he was able to
predict 9/11 and the stock

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.835 align:middle line:90%
market crash of 2008.

00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:11.797 align:middle line:84%
Experts suggest his system
is similar to how the NSA

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:15.926 align:middle line:84%
or CIA have been monitoring
the emotional tensions created

00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:19.179 align:middle line:84%
by each individual
user on the internet.

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:22.182 align:middle line:84%
Could it be possible
that the Web Bot is proof

00:27:22.182 --> 00:27:25.394 align:middle line:84%
that we are driving
the disclosure?

00:27:25.394 --> 00:27:30.065 align:middle line:84%
If we are driving disclosure,
how are we connected?

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:31.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that was amazing.

00:27:31.275 --> 00:27:34.903 align:middle line:84%
How he collects this internet
chatter, puts it together,

00:27:34.903 --> 00:27:37.823 align:middle line:84%
computerizes it,
calls it the Web Bots,

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:40.951 align:middle line:84%
and they make predictions based
on things that people feel.

00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It makes sense.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.996 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That makes sense.

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.123 align:middle line:84%
You know, there
are sociologists,

00:27:46.123 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there's 36
studies over 40 years that

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.505 align:middle line:84%
show that the human body is
a little bit like a computer

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:55.757 align:middle line:84%
or an internet
system, and actually

00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:59.636 align:middle line:84%
registers within it what's
going to happen in the future.

00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:01.346 align:middle line:84%
So if something scary
is going to happen,

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.682 align:middle line:84%
the body gets scared
before it even happens.

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:04.558 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:06.393 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So we seem to
be designed for that.

00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So it makes perfect
sense to me that somebody

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:12.274 align:middle line:84%
can listen to what's going on,
pull the themes out, and say

00:28:12.274 --> 00:28:14.026 align:middle line:84%
look, this is where
people are at,

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:15.611 align:middle line:84%
so this is what's
going to happen.

00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:15.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:17.487 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Makes
perfect sense to me.

00:28:17.487 --> 00:28:19.156 align:middle line:84%
I think it's how the
body functions too.

00:28:19.156 --> 00:28:22.242 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have called it
the wireless internet, where

00:28:22.242 --> 00:28:26.455 align:middle line:84%
everyone and everything
is connected.

00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:30.167 align:middle line:84%
And that allows us to
communicate with other people

00:28:30.167 --> 00:28:34.087 align:middle line:84%
psychically, to pick up on
things that could happen.

00:28:34.087 --> 00:28:37.549 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's a grand
design of the universe.

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:41.879 align:middle line:84%
We were wired this way, or
wirelessly wired this way.

00:28:41.879 --> 00:28:42.679 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I love it.

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:43.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we're hooked in.

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:46.433 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And we're-- well,
physicists use the word

00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:47.476 align:middle line:90%
untangled.

00:28:47.476 --> 00:28:49.186 align:middle line:90%
We're all interconnected.

00:28:49.186 --> 00:28:52.856 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in some of the
neurons in the brain,

00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:59.279 align:middle line:84%
there's these sort of little
kind of vibrating proteins.

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:84%
They're polymers and this,
that, and the other thing.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.201 align:middle line:84%
But what scientists
are starting to show

00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:06.954 align:middle line:84%
is that they attune
to the universe.

00:29:06.954 --> 00:29:09.456 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually
reading and responding

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:11.792 align:middle line:84%
to what's happening
around us, not only

00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:13.919 align:middle line:90%
with people, but the cosmos.

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:17.123 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to wonder what
the grand design really is,

00:29:17.123 --> 00:29:17.923 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:18.757 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you have to.

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:19.591 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yep, yep.

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:21.051 align:middle line:90%
And can we respond to it?

00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:24.888 align:middle line:84%
Can we even more than
that be actors within it

00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:26.431 align:middle line:90%
and keep creating good?

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:29.476 align:middle line:84%
Can each of us
individually just decide,

00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:31.228 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a
force for the good?

00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually helping to
create the future that way.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some time
ago, Jimmy Kimmel

00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:37.776 align:middle line:90%
had Theresa Caputo on his show.

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.361 align:middle line:90%
She's a medium.

00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Watch what she had to say.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.824 align:middle line:84%
>>THERESA CAPUTO: I don't
see the way we see here

00:29:43.824 --> 00:29:44.825 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:47.327 align:middle line:84%
So like if I say to someone oh,
there's a mother energy here

00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:49.705 align:middle line:84%
for you, and you tell me that
your mother isn't departed,

00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.915 align:middle line:84%
it could be a grandmother,
could be a mother in law,

00:29:51.915 --> 00:29:53.792 align:middle line:84%
could be an aunt or
someone like a mother.

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:54.908 align:middle line:84%
OK, it doesn't have--
>>JIMMY KIMMEL:

00:29:54.908 --> 00:29:56.461 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't like his mother in
law, can we not let her in?

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.502 align:middle line:84%
>>GUILLERMO RODRIGUEZ:
Unfortunately, she's still

00:29:58.502 --> 00:30:01.425 align:middle line:90%
will us.

00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:03.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so
what do you say about that?

00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:08.098 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So that just begs the
question, who's in charge?

00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, are we making
our own decisions?

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.687 align:middle line:84%
How many invisible beings are
around us that are helping us?

00:30:13.687 --> 00:30:16.898 align:middle line:84%
I know my dad shows
up every so often.

00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:19.026 align:middle line:84%
He's been dead for
about 20 years.

00:30:19.026 --> 00:30:21.945 align:middle line:84%
And he was never a
man of many words.

00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:24.948 align:middle line:84%
But when he does show up,
he's very clear about telling

00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:27.075 align:middle line:90%
me do this and don't do that.

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:30.495 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one time I was
bemoaning you know, dad,

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:33.999 align:middle line:84%
can you line me up with
a good man to date?

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, I'll get on it.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.294 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Especially
with your track record.

00:30:37.294 --> 00:30:38.837 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:42.424 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up within
about a month with a date

00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:46.261 align:middle line:84%
with a gentleman who could
have been my dad's twin.

00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:50.849 align:middle line:84%
Flew airplanes, owns a
store called Wally's.

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:53.101 align:middle line:90%
My dad's name was Wally.

00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:55.263 align:middle line:90%
Now he wasn't the man for me.

00:30:55.263 --> 00:30:56.063 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:56.063 --> 00:30:57.981 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: But I thought,
OK dad, thank you

00:30:57.981 --> 00:30:59.483 align:middle line:90%
for helping to create my future.

00:30:59.483 --> 00:31:01.276 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was your
dad's choice, right.

00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:03.403 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: That was
my dad's choice.

00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:06.406 align:middle line:84%
So it did kind of
remind me, I still

00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:09.659 align:middle line:84%
want to be in charge of
my own choices in the end.

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:13.538 align:middle line:84%
What have we learned
about the predictions

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:19.211 align:middle line:84%
of the future and the ability
to react or not react to them?

00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:21.713 align:middle line:84%
Because we talked about
how your family escaped

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.799 align:middle line:90%
a falling tree, for example.

00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:24.633 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:25.592 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They listened.

00:31:25.592 --> 00:31:28.303 align:middle line:84%
There was something, there
was an event that occurred.

00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:30.263 align:middle line:90%
How many people listen, Cyndi?

00:31:30.263 --> 00:31:32.557 align:middle line:90%
How many people don't?

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.476 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I think most
people don't listen.

00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:37.104 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably
the biggest challenge.

00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:39.439 align:middle line:84%
I think people,
in general, aren't

00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:41.608 align:middle line:90%
in touch with their intuition.

00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:45.403 align:middle line:84%
Whether their intuition is
the small voice or a feeling

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:47.614 align:middle line:84%
or they get visions
or however it

00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:50.867 align:middle line:84%
is that the world makes
itself known to them,

00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:53.912 align:middle line:84%
or their inner self
communicates with them.

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:59.459 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in such a fast
paced superficial society,

00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:02.546 align:middle line:84%
that we don't emphasize
the deeper ways of being.

00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:04.339 align:middle line:84%
And that we don't
get it affirmed.

00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:06.466 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when people
go to work, you know,

00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:08.093 align:middle line:84%
they don't start
the day by going,

00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:10.011 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream about
this proposal.

00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:10.971 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:10.971 --> 00:32:13.807 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So I think we should put
this in there instead of this.

00:32:13.807 --> 00:32:16.685 align:middle line:84%
You can't talk like
that in your every day.

00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:19.229 align:middle line:84%
I can, because of what
I do for a living.

00:32:19.229 --> 00:32:21.398 align:middle line:84%
People can come and
talk to me about it.

00:32:21.398 --> 00:32:24.442 align:middle line:84%
But there aren't very many
places where it's affirmed.

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:27.571 align:middle line:84%
You know, and even many
religions are sort of scared,

00:32:27.571 --> 00:32:29.781 align:middle line:84%
you know, that people
may walk outside

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:32.242 align:middle line:90%
of the frame of the dogma.

00:32:32.242 --> 00:32:34.286 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if
it doesn't sound,

00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:36.872 align:middle line:84%
like if you're Christian, like
Christ said it, oh my gosh, you

00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:38.957 align:middle line:90%
better not pay attention to it.

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.751 align:middle line:84%
So I think in general,
people don't pay attention.

00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really unfortunate.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.589 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's really sad.

00:32:45.589 --> 00:32:49.926 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to cultivate
our own inner ways of knowing.

00:32:49.926 --> 00:32:51.928 align:middle line:84%
And not just so that
we create the future,

00:32:51.928 --> 00:32:55.056 align:middle line:84%
so that we can show up in
life and be who we really are.

00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:56.892 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going to
get any sense of what

00:32:56.892 --> 00:32:59.186 align:middle line:84%
we should do or
shouldn't do, you know,

00:32:59.186 --> 00:33:00.687 align:middle line:90%
unless we're really in touch.

00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a
biological thing within us?

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.024 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:04.774 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:04.774 --> 00:33:05.192 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:05.442 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That allows
this to happen?

00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:06.242 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:33:06.242 --> 00:33:09.321 align:middle line:84%
And even the studies
of empathy suggest

00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:13.116 align:middle line:84%
that there are at least
90 neural peptides that

00:33:13.116 --> 00:33:16.995 align:middle line:84%
enable us to have this sort of
social circuitry inside of us

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:20.373 align:middle line:84%
that not only picks up on what
other people are going through,

00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:25.128 align:middle line:84%
but what they could do, and
how we should then respond.

00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:27.756 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, my
studies of empathy

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:30.383 align:middle line:84%
always emphasize the
intuitive component.

00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:33.345 align:middle line:84%
And there's a step
within the five or six

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:36.056 align:middle line:84%
that are usually involved
in recognizing what

00:33:36.056 --> 00:33:38.183 align:middle line:90%
we're emphatically picking up.

00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:40.518 align:middle line:84%
That we're predicting
what's going to happen

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.729 align:middle line:84%
or what somebody is going
to do in the future.

00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:42.854 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:43.897 align:middle line:90%
We get e-mails.

00:33:43.897 --> 00:33:45.774 align:middle line:84%
You've gotten e mails
on your website.

00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:48.151 align:middle line:84%
People are constantly
contacting you.

00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:51.863 align:middle line:84%
Joanne from Carson City,
Nevada wants to know, only some

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:54.532 align:middle line:84%
of the predictions that
you made come true.

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:56.034 align:middle line:90%
Why doesn't everything happen?

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:56.868 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:57.994 align:middle line:90%
I get that question a lot.

00:33:57.994 --> 00:33:59.329 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sorry to be that tough.

00:33:59.329 --> 00:34:00.413 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No, but it's true.

00:34:00.413 --> 00:34:01.873 align:middle line:84%
I have one client
who came to me,

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.792 align:middle line:84%
she goes, seven out
of the eight things

00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:05.168 align:middle line:90%
that you predicted came true.

00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:06.211 align:middle line:90%
How about this one thing?

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:07.128 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty good.

00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:07.671 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I think it's great.

00:34:07.671 --> 00:34:09.122 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 70% is
pretty darn good.

00:34:09.122 --> 00:34:09.922 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:34:09.922 --> 00:34:11.424 align:middle line:90%
I was a little bit like, hello.

00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:13.134 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking for?

00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:14.294 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody is 100%.

00:34:14.294 --> 00:34:15.094 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No.

00:34:15.094 --> 00:34:16.388 align:middle line:90%
Because we have free will.

00:34:16.388 --> 00:34:18.556 align:middle line:84%
Because people can
change their minds.

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.976 align:middle line:84%
Because even if there's
like a destiny point,

00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:23.353 align:middle line:84%
even if there's a
certainty that's planned,

00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:26.731 align:middle line:84%
all a client or their friend
or somebody else in their life

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.692 align:middle line:84%
has to do is make a
different decision,

00:34:28.692 --> 00:34:30.193 align:middle line:90%
and it's not going to convene.

00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:31.610 align:middle line:90%
It's just not going to happen.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.072 align:middle line:84%
The other reason is people
have to do their own work.

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:35.407 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me, but you know.

00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:37.033 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
come easy, does it.

00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:39.786 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: That book, I actually
spent two years on that book.

00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:41.204 align:middle line:84%
If somebody had
said to me, you're

00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:43.415 align:middle line:84%
going to write a 1,200
page book and I never

00:34:43.415 --> 00:34:45.375 align:middle line:84%
did anything about
it, I would never

00:34:45.375 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:90%
have written a 1,200 page book.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.879 align:middle line:84%
You actually have to
do the doing in order

00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:51.214 align:middle line:90%
to make something happen.

00:34:51.214 --> 00:34:52.966 align:middle line:84%
I had one client come
to me, and she said,

00:34:52.966 --> 00:34:54.551 align:middle line:90%
when am I going to buy a house?

00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:57.087 align:middle line:90%
And I said, do you have a job?

00:34:57.087 --> 00:34:57.887 align:middle line:90%
She goes, no.

00:34:57.887 --> 00:34:59.306 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why
don't we work on how

00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get a job.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.225 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a down payment?

00:35:02.225 --> 00:35:03.601 align:middle line:90%
Do you have everything?

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:04.602 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:07.689 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's free will
that people don't always

00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:09.232 align:middle line:90%
go with the program.

00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:11.735 align:middle line:84%
And you have to do the
work to create something.

00:35:11.735 --> 00:35:13.737 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But again,
70% is pretty good.

00:35:13.737 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I thought
that was fantastic.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.031 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do too.

00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:16.323 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:17.198 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;>NOORY: I do too.

00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:21.119 align:middle line:84%
Jerry from Buzzards
Bay, Massachusetts.

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.454 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: OK.

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:26.458 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to choose what's
going to happen to my future.

00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:28.251 align:middle line:90%
How can I do that?

00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:29.252 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Well, good luck.

00:35:29.252 --> 00:35:31.254 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:31.254 --> 00:35:36.176 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that to some
extent we can monitor or manage

00:35:36.176 --> 00:35:37.302 align:middle line:90%
some of our future.

00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:39.012 align:middle line:90%
Again, there's free will.

00:35:39.012 --> 00:35:42.758 align:middle line:84%
People usually want to know how
they can manage somebody else's

00:35:42.758 --> 00:35:43.558 align:middle line:90%
future.

00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:45.727 align:middle line:84%
How they can force that
person to marry them.

00:35:45.727 --> 00:35:47.812 align:middle line:84%
How can they force that
person to give them a job.

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:48.772 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you can't.

00:35:48.772 --> 00:35:49.939 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You cannot do that.

00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:51.274 align:middle line:90%
That's breaking their free will.

00:35:51.274 --> 00:35:52.859 align:middle line:90%
And it'll backfire anyway.

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:54.611 align:middle line:84%
It's just absolutely
not going the work.

00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:56.363 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe
that if somebody

00:35:56.363 --> 00:35:59.199 align:middle line:84%
is very dedicated and
goal oriented, you know,

00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:02.202 align:middle line:84%
and they sit down
and they summon up

00:36:02.202 --> 00:36:05.872 align:middle line:84%
what they're willing to do
to create a certain future,

00:36:05.872 --> 00:36:08.166 align:middle line:84%
I'm a spiritual person,
you know, they tune in.

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:11.628 align:middle line:84%
Is this even an appropriate
future for me to work toward?

00:36:11.628 --> 00:36:14.172 align:middle line:84%
Is this within the
line of reason?

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.424 align:middle line:90%
Does this fit my signature self?

00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that they
can come up with a plan

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.388 align:middle line:84%
and stay on the
plan to get there.

00:36:21.388 --> 00:36:24.099 align:middle line:84%
The key with plan
making, however,

00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:27.227 align:middle line:84%
is it's the old,
the best laid plans.

00:36:27.227 --> 00:36:29.187 align:middle line:84%
You have to stay in
the moment and keep

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:32.857 align:middle line:84%
picking up on what's working,
what's not, guidance,

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:37.362 align:middle line:84%
you know, rearranging your
day as a crisis comes up.

00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:40.407 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that we
can develop our energy

00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:42.776 align:middle line:84%
to work toward a future
and create it into being.

00:36:42.776 --> 00:36:43.576 align:middle line:90%
I've done it.

00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:43.827 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:36:43.827 --> 00:36:45.495 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I think most
of us have done it.

00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:46.996 align:middle line:90%
Carridy, Ogden, Utah.

00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:49.165 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to
make someone choose me

00:36:49.165 --> 00:36:50.834 align:middle line:84%
as their future
romantic partner?

00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:52.168 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: See, that's what I mean.

00:36:52.168 --> 00:36:54.462 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
something you do.

00:36:54.462 --> 00:36:55.588 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's what I mean.

00:36:55.588 --> 00:36:57.132 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to give two answers.

00:36:57.132 --> 00:36:59.509 align:middle line:84%
The first is unfortunately
to some extent

00:36:59.509 --> 00:37:02.679 align:middle line:84%
yes, if you're willing to
be really manipulative,

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:07.851 align:middle line:84%
and if you're a very
apt spellcaster.

00:37:07.851 --> 00:37:09.394 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using that
word on purpose.

00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:09.894 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.271 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I do believe--
>>NOORY: Like a witch?

00:37:11.271 --> 00:37:12.897 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well yeah,
but a lot of people

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:16.234 align:middle line:84%
are manipulating others
energetically or psychically,

00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even know
that they're doing it.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:19.654 align:middle line:90%
So I've seen this.

00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:90%
We've probably experienced.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.534 align:middle line:84%
This somebody is setting their
hat for a romantic partner.

00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:29.122 align:middle line:84%
And basically sending them the
psychic or energetic messages

00:37:29.122 --> 00:37:30.999 align:middle line:84%
like if you choose
me I'll do this.

00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:32.792 align:middle line:90%
If you choose me I'll do that.

00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:34.794 align:middle line:84%
You know, so you can
manipulate somebody

00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:37.589 align:middle line:84%
either psychically or
obviously physically,

00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:38.965 align:middle line:90%
to make them choose you.

00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean the relationship
is going to work.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.552 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean it's
going to be happy.

00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:45.305 align:middle line:84%
But to some extent, I do
think we can manipulate.

00:37:45.305 --> 00:37:50.268 align:middle line:84%
Can you, given the law of free
will, make somebody pick you?

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:51.394 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:52.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't do that.

00:37:52.145 --> 00:37:52.729 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No.

00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:53.605 align:middle line:90%
Nor should you.

00:37:53.605 --> 00:37:54.856 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just put is
out into the universe.

00:37:54.856 --> 00:37:57.692 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You put it out in the
universe and you open it up

00:37:57.692 --> 00:38:01.112 align:middle line:84%
and you say if this is the
right place, the right person,

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:02.489 align:middle line:90%
you know, here we go.

00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:03.948 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can offer.

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your last e
mail comes from David

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.577 align:middle line:84%
in Tampa Bay,
Florida, of course.

00:38:07.577 --> 00:38:10.705 align:middle line:84%
If I think something bad is
going to happen to someone,

00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:11.539 align:middle line:90%
should I tell them?

00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:13.917 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's something we
started talking about with you.

00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:15.084 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah, we did, we do.

00:38:15.084 --> 00:38:17.629 align:middle line:84%
And you know for me, I always
check in with guidance.

00:38:17.629 --> 00:38:20.924 align:middle line:84%
Like is this mine to
share with them or not?

00:38:20.924 --> 00:38:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Because sometimes it's not.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.218 align:middle line:90%
They're on their path.

00:38:23.218 --> 00:38:25.261 align:middle line:90%
We're not supposed to interfere.

00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:27.180 align:middle line:90%
And we could be wrong, right?

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.014 align:middle line:90%
We could be wrong.

00:38:28.014 --> 00:38:30.475 align:middle line:84%
It's not like
somebody, even if they

00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:32.644 align:middle line:84%
know what could happen
in the future is always

00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:33.895 align:middle line:90%
going to be accurate.

00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So I always go with
guidance on that.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.857 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have, let me tell
you what I've done sometimes

00:38:37.857 --> 00:38:39.067 align:middle line:90%
like with my granddaughter.

00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:40.310 align:middle line:90%
She's 22 years old.

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.946 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
have been times

00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:46.199 align:middle line:84%
I have said, I need
you to be careful today

00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:47.033 align:middle line:90%
when you're driving.

00:38:47.033 --> 00:38:48.576 align:middle line:90%
I just get this weird feeling.

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yep.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:54.082 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there was a day
when she was about 18 years old

00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:56.876 align:middle line:90%
and it was snowy in St. Louis.

00:38:56.876 --> 00:38:57.911 align:middle line:90%
I had that feeling.

00:38:57.911 --> 00:38:58.711 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:03.341 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I said to
her, be careful today.

00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:06.386 align:middle line:84%
Two hours later, she's calling
me crying because she's

00:39:06.386 --> 00:39:08.471 align:middle line:90%
gotten into a car accident.

00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:11.391 align:middle line:84%
She slid on the snow
and somebody swiped her

00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:12.684 align:middle line:90%
and cut her off.

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:14.727 align:middle line:90%
She went spinning into a ditch.

00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:15.562 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:39:15.562 --> 00:39:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Got her towed
out and everything else.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.690 align:middle line:90%
And thank god she's OK.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:19.566 align:middle line:90%
But I felt something.

00:39:19.566 --> 00:39:20.366 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:39:20.366 --> 00:39:21.568 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I felt something.

00:39:21.568 --> 00:39:26.823 align:middle line:84%
So she looked at me and
instead of saying Papa,

00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:29.826 align:middle line:84%
you knew this or this
was going to happen.

00:39:29.826 --> 00:39:32.537 align:middle line:90%
She went, you jinxed me.

00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:33.997 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh.

00:39:33.997 --> 00:39:36.666 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So she actually
felt-- >>DALE: Wow.

00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:38.334 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --I put that
into the universe.

00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:39.752 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: What a reaction.

00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:41.129 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that conceivable?

00:39:41.129 --> 00:39:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Did I create that?

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.881 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No, no, no.

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.508 align:middle line:90%
I do not believe that.

00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Because you were coming
from a good place.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.513 align:middle line:84%
And you weren't looking
for the information, right.

00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:52.348 align:middle line:84%
You weren't looking
for it, and you weren't

00:39:52.348 --> 00:39:53.766 align:middle line:90%
looking for a bad outcome.

00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:55.268 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was, no, it
was something that I felt.

00:39:55.268 --> 00:39:56.227 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It came to you.

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:58.021 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago I
had three clients

00:39:58.021 --> 00:39:59.814 align:middle line:84%
who came in the same
week, and they had all

00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:01.733 align:middle line:90%
lost their 21-year-old sons.

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:02.643 align:middle line:90%
It was traumatic.

00:40:02.643 --> 00:40:03.443 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Horrible.

00:40:03.443 --> 00:40:04.444 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: And tragic.

00:40:04.444 --> 00:40:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered, why is this
happening in my practice

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.699 align:middle line:90%
this week?

00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:11.784 align:middle line:84%
Well, my then 21
year old son was

00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:14.495 align:middle line:84%
going to drive to Florida
with a number of his friends.

00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:15.455 align:middle line:90%
So you know what I did?

00:40:15.455 --> 00:40:17.749 align:middle line:84%
I bought him a ticket
to fly instead.

00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:18.833 align:middle line:90%
I thought, you know what?

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:21.753 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea if there's
a message in this for me.

00:40:21.753 --> 00:40:24.714 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to be safe
and smart and I'm his mom.

00:40:24.714 --> 00:40:25.840 align:middle line:90%
He was fine.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.550 align:middle line:90%
He never asked me why I did it.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.595 align:middle line:84%
Because he's learned not to
ask mom like weird questions,

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:31.763 align:middle line:90%
because mom is weird.

00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:33.556 align:middle line:84%
But he took the ticket,
he went down there.

00:40:33.556 --> 00:40:34.766 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, nothing happened.

00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:36.267 align:middle line:90%
But who's to say?

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:37.769 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say it was
a message for me

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:39.687 align:middle line:84%
or I was just supposed
to help them that week?

00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:43.066 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the greatest
advice you can give people

00:40:43.066 --> 00:40:45.401 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to predictions?

00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:49.322 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Cultivate your
ability to sense, to feel,

00:40:49.322 --> 00:40:50.573 align:middle line:90%
to see your intuition.

00:40:50.573 --> 00:40:54.285 align:middle line:84%
Stay in touch with your wise
self and your form of guidance.

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Because it will
always show you right.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:56.371 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:40:56.371 --> 00:40:58.247 align:middle line:84%
Cyndi, thanks for being on
"Beyond Belief." >>DALE:

00:40:58.247 --> 00:40:58.498 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:40:58.498 --> 00:40:59.791 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a delight.

00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:04.253 align:middle line:84%
So the next time you have that
intuitive feeling, react to it.

00:41:04.253 --> 00:41:07.966 align:middle line:84%
Because the chances are
it's really happening.

00:41:07.966 --> 00:41:11.219 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:12.469 align:middle line:90%
