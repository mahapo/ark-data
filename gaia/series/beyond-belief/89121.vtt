00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT FELIX: Hi.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing here--
or sitting here,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I guess-- in Kerry Park
overlooking the Puget Sound.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Way in the distance,
about 60 miles away,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.045 align:middle line:84%
if it weren't quite
so cloudy, you'd

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:90%
be seeing the Olympic Range.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the opposite
direction, about 60 miles

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.920 align:middle line:84%
in that direction, you'd be
seeing the Cascade Range.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
This entire area,
16,000 years ago,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:84%
all the way from the Olympic
Range to the Cascade Range,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
was buried beneath 3,000
to 4,000 feet of ice.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm talking
about more than a half

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:84%
a mile of ice straight up,
more than one kilometer of ice

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.308 align:middle line:84%
straight up from where
I'm sitting right now.

00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:50.808 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:50.808 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm Robert Felix, author of
"Not by Fire but by Ice."

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.955 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to warn
you that the next ice

00:00:57.955 --> 00:00:59.325 align:middle line:90%
age could begin any day.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Now I'd like to explain why.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.965 align:middle line:84%
So please stay tuned and
prepare for an amazing episode

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:10.972 align:middle line:84%
of "Beyond Belief"
with George Noory.

00:01:10.972 --> 00:01:12.325 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe any more.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.495 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.405 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.365 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And of
course, through the magic

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:10%
of television, here I
am on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.675 align:middle line:10%
And can you imagine
ice a half a mile high?

00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:43.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine that.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Go outside and just visualize
a half a mile in the sky,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:90%
all the way up.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Robert Felix with
us, and his book

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:84%
is "Not by Fire
but by Ice," which

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
he believes is an ice
age that has begun.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.065 align:middle line:84%
Robert, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Thank you, George.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure glad to be here.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You know, I look
at the cover of this book,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:10%
and there's a city there, which
you don't like to talk about,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:10%
to scare the living
daylights out of people,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:10%
but it looks like Chicago to
me, or something like that.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.720 align:middle line:90%
A half a mile high of ice?

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.069 align:middle line:90%
How is that conceivable?

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: You know, when
you talk about that city,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I had a geologist from just
north of New York City who

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.750 align:middle line:84%
emailed me and complained,
because he said,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
you know, the ice was a lot
deeper than what it shows there

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:90%
on that cover.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not New York City.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a make-believe city.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:10%
But a lot of northern cities
will be covered again.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Former architect--
how did you get interested

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
in the possibility
of an ice age?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:90%
What did you see?

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: It's hard
to explain, really.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:10%
I began this in 1991.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:10%
I was just going to
write a short article

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:10%
about what happened
to the dinosaurs.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.345 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I believed,
like other people did,

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
that the dinosaurs were
killed by a huge meteor that

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:90%
probably landed, hit the Earth.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
But as I researched that, and
researched it more and more,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I kept hearing about
magnetic reversals.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I kept hearing about
this layer of iridium.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to notice other
little allusions to ice ages,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.275 align:middle line:84%
and I just changed my mind about
that as I did the research.

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And as you
changed your mind,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
what did you see that has
come to the conclusion

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:84%
now, that we are
in a mini ice age?

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: What I saw,
really, is cycles.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
There are just so many
cycles that point this way.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
The first little cycle,
I guess you'd call it,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:90%
is a solar retrograde cycle.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- happens
about every 180 years.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is when
Saturn and Jupiter

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
are both in the same
quadrant of the solar system.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And somehow-- well, there was
a couple scientists, Rhodes

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Fairbridge and John Sanders,
that wrote about this first.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
But they say it tugs on
the sun and actually makes

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.885 align:middle line:84%
the sun's orbit change a
little bit, just during--

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't take much.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.135 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Doesn't take much.

00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is every 180 years.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Well then, double that cycle,
and every 360 years, the Earth

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
goes into what we
call a little ice sge.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Then you multiply that
cycle by another four,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and every 1440 years, the Earth
goes into a period of cooling.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Then you multiply that
cycle by another eight,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and about every
11,500 years ago, we

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
go into what is
known as an ice age.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So that cycle has returned
just time and time

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and time-- all of those
cycles, time and time

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:90%
again for millions of years.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And I wish the scientists
who do all this computer

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.824 align:middle line:84%
modeling would put those
cycles into their models.

00:05:04.824 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
the definition

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:90%
of an ice age, Robert?

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Because people have
the misconception

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
that it's constant, that
you have no summers.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.445 align:middle line:90%
That's not true, is it?

00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, no.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.365 align:middle line:84%
And plus, the whole world
is not covered by ice.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:84%
All it is during an ice
age, it's not a cold age.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that much
colder than it is right now.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.889 align:middle line:84%
All it is is a time when
we get more and more snow--

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's longer.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: The snow stays longer.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
these big glaciers

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:84%
are going to come grinding
out of the North, or something

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we get
more and more snow.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, we get
a summer when it

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
doesn't melt, like
right now in Scotland.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:84%
There are areas in
Scotland right now,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:84%
this year, where last winter's
snow has not yet melted.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists who
have looked at that,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:90%
they call it firn.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've had early snow
falls this year in some areas.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Yes, in many
areas, definitely this year.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
an indicator that we

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
are headed into an
ice age right now.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the ice then starts
to accumulate during an ice

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Roughly how many feet per
season does it continue to grow?

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, during
the last ice age,

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.905 align:middle line:84%
it took about 5,000 years
for it to fully build up.

00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:27.127 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it builds up.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.918 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: You're talking
a lot, because it

00:06:29.918 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
takes 100 feet of snow
in order to compress down

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:90%
into one foot of ice.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So what we're looking at, and
what I'm expecting to see,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.107 align:middle line:84%
is giant snowstorms, just giant
snow storms, more and more

00:06:41.107 --> 00:06:41.607 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:06:41.607 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what happens to us?

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Roofs collapse.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:90%
You can't travel.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: I was doing a
radio interview in Canada,

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.102 align:middle line:84%
and one caller called in, and
said, I live in a trailer.

00:06:55.102 --> 00:06:57.435 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm just going
to get some great big jacks.

00:06:57.435 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to keep
jacking that thing up.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go higher and higher.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: But I think two miles
high might be a little bit more

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:90%
than any jack could handle.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And he'd better pray
for a gradual thawing,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:84%
so he comes down
slowly, which is also

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:90%
an interesting question.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.555 align:middle line:90%
How fast does it go away?

00:07:16.555 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, you know, the
last ice age ended in a hurry.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
There's one chapter in my
book I called "Noah's Deluge."

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:84%
But it melted so
fast that there were

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:90%
giant floods around the world.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And actually the Gulf of
Mexico filled so quickly

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:84%
that there were some areas
there where-- one scientist, I

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
don't remember his name, but he
said that the trees were buried

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
almost overnight
in this briny deep.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And so that filled that quickly.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.919 align:middle line:84%
There was a glacial
Lake Missoula flood.

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've heard of that.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
But what happened with
that is a ton of ice

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
came marching down out of
the North, in that case.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was called
the Purcell Lobe.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But it came down out of
Canada, in Idaho and Montana,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:90%
right about the border.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up coming down
and damming up the Clark Fork

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:90%
River.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've been lucky
enough I've been

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.407 align:middle line:84%
able to drive that
Ice Age flood route.

00:08:21.407 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:90%
So I have a picture.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:84%
This Clark Fork
River is a big river.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:90%
And it damned that up.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And the water kept
building up, building up,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:84%
until the city of what is
now the city of Missoula

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:90%
was 1,100 feet below the water.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:90%
So when I drove through this--

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Covered, totally.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: It was covered.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.885 align:middle line:84%
And when I drove
through Missoula,

00:08:41.885 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky enough to
talk to some people there.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And they pointed out
to me, up on the hill

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:90%
where the ancient shoreline was.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to get
a picture of that.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually see
the ancient shoreline

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:90%
from 11,500 years ago.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, when the
water got that deep,

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:90%
it built up the pressure.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It blew out the bottom
of that ice dam.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And a giant flood just raced
down the Columbia River.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a place
along there called

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Dry Falls, which I was
lucky enough to visit.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:90%
But it came down through there.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
It went through an area
called the Wallula Gap,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:84%
which is a narrowing--
still a half a mile wide.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.284 align:middle line:84%
But it let the water
go through there.

00:09:29.284 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:90%
It damned it up.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So it was 800 feet deep
when it went through.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:84%
When it went through
Portland, Oregon,

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:84%
it left much of the gravel
bar that Portland is now

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:90%
situated on.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Giant floods--
and the same thing

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
happened, giant floods
at the same time

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
went down the Saint
Lawrence seaway.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.335 align:middle line:84%
Connecticut River--
150 feet deep.

00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:84%
All of that stuff,
essentially, so yeah,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
to answer your question,
it ends in a hurry.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people have talked
about global warming, Robert.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are saying
global warming.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's man-made, or not,
that's a different argument

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
How could we be
in a mini-ice age

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and still have global warming?

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.201 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: It doesn't have to do
with being cold, just the more

00:10:12.201 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:90%
snow.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Because during the last ice
age, a lot of the United States

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.560 align:middle line:84%
was essentially still
about as warm as it is now.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I think Florida was maybe
three or four degrees colder.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I had mentioned, in the opening,
about the Seattle area being

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
covered with 3,000
to 4,000 feet of ice.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet that ice only
extended as far south

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:90%
as Olympia, Washington.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.542 align:middle line:84%
If you went 150 miles
south of Olympia--

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, I guess
they figured temperatures--

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
they look at the kind of
plants that grew in the area,

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and they figured it was about
seven degrees colder than it

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:90%
is right now.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But Florida, maybe three
or four degrees colder,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
down near the equator,
temperatures generally the same

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:90%
as they as they are now.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So we are not talking
about the whole world

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:90%
being covered with ice.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:10%
Essentially the ice
extended down out

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:14.190 align:middle line:10%
of Canada, covered
Seattle, then it moved up.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:10%
So it did not cover
Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:10%
Then it essentially
followed the Missouri River,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:10%
so that on the north side
of the Missouri River,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:10%
there was a 15-- they figure
about a 15-story high cliff

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:10%
of ice.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But on the south side
of the Missouri River,

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:84%
people could have lived
quite successfully.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.774 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would there have
been a migration today,

00:11:35.774 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
if this were to happen,
where people would literally

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:90%
have to move out?

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh, I think so--

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To survive?

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.501 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: --if we get the
warning, unless we get buried.

00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Because more snow-- I was
doing an interview in Winnipeg,

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and somebody said, you
know, it's not that cold.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
But again, this doesn't
have to be colder.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:84%
All we need is, let's
say, that Winnipeg

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.992 align:middle line:84%
gets two feet of snow
a day for 30 days.

00:11:59.992 --> 00:12:01.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's conceivable.

00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: All of a sudden,
you've got five stories of snow.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, roofs collapse.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:90%
You can't--

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: You can't land an
airplane to rescue people.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:90%
You can't bring in trucks.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.195 align:middle line:90%
The trains can't get through.

00:12:12.195 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't get out.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.235 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: You can't get out.

00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:15.400 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:90%
So we need to be warned.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that I
can warn people of this.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you warn
us, what do we do?

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Well, I think--

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.847 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The sky is falling.

00:12:28.847 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: One of the things
that I've been warning people

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
about, at least, is
I'm afraid that we're

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:84%
going to be fighting
in the streets for food

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:84%
long before we get
covered by ice.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:90%
So I am not selling food.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
But I am warning
people that they

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:84%
should be having
some food available.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Because, well, like
right now, we're

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
looking at the grain fields
in Canada, and the prairies.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:84%
They just had early
rainstorms and early freezes,

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and so all of a sudden the wheat
is laying flat on the ground.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.906 align:middle line:84%
And things like that I think
we have to worry about first.

00:13:06.906 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is kind
of scary, isn't it?

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: It's really scary.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.491 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet people don't see it
right under their eyes, Robert.

00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: No.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've heard so much
about global warming.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And again I go back, and I
think the global warming,

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.887 align:middle line:84%
let's say from '75 until the
year 2000 is probably true.

00:13:25.887 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was
caused by humans.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:90%
And now it's cooling again.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
But so many of us have
been indoctrinated

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
with this idea of global
warming that we're not

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.464 align:middle line:84%
seeing what's happening
in front of us right now.

00:13:39.464 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
some scientists

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:84%
will agree with you that, hey,
maybe we're in an ice age.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Yes, there are.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:84%
One of them, Piers Corbyn-- he's
an astrophysicist in London.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I were in
London a few years ago.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.124 align:middle line:84%
We were lucky enough
to meet Pierce,

00:13:56.124 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and actually he had us over
at his house for dinner.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he read
"Not by Fire but by Ice?"

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.002 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: He hadn't before then,
but I'm sure he has by now.

00:14:03.002 --> 00:14:04.377 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
give him a copy?

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:05.835 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Oh, yes
I gave him a copy.

00:14:05.835 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
But he says that we are entering
a little ice age right now.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
astrophysicist saying that.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Another one that would say that
is Dr. Khabibullo Abdusamatov.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a mouthful.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great name.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: But anyway, he is an
astrophysicist out of Russia.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And he says that we
are entering, well,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
he has been saying
for years that we

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:84%
were going to be entering a
little ice age by the year

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:90%
2014.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're there.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:10%
Now Dr. Abdusamatov in addition
to being an astrophysicist,

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:10%
he's also-- I mean, we're
talking about credibility here.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:10%
He's also the head of
the Russian portion

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:10%
of the International
Space Station.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So he thinks that we're
headed into a little ice age.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Don Easterbrook, he's a
climate scientist, a geologist.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
He says we're headed
into-- I don't

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
know if he calls it a little ice
age, but 30 years of cooling,

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:03.655 align:middle line:90%
at least.

00:15:03.655 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Climatologist
Cliff Harris-- so I

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
credible scientists

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
who are beginning to
look at this this way.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.737 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Tim Ball, he's a--

00:15:18.737 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know Tim.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Yeah, I think
you've had Tim on your show.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But Dr. Tim Ball
was gracious enough,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
he came on a radio
program with me.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't
know that he's

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
saying it's a little ice
age, but he's definitely

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:84%
agreeing that we're
headed into cooler times.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Quite a few scientists.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, they say that
the glaciers are melting away.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.185 align:middle line:90%
One, is that true?

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Two, if it's not
true, then where's

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:84%
the evidence that
they're coming back up?

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, some glaciers
definitely are melting away.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I've been to see some of them,
seen some of the ones in Canada

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that are melting away, and
some of the ones on Mount

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Rainier that are melting away.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's others
that are growing

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:90%
that we are not hearing about.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
A big area is in
the United States.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything
you read makes it sound

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:84%
as if all of the glaciers
in the United States

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:90%
are melting or gone away.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:84%
But in California,
on Mount Shasta,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Mount Shasta has seven glaciers.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:84%
All seven of those
glaciers have been

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
growing for at least
the last 50 years.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.699 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you say
growing, at what clip?

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: You know,
I don't know that.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.406 align:middle line:90%
I just know they're growing.

00:16:33.406 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:84%
There's Whitney Glacier
on Mount Rainier--

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
on Mount Shasta that's
actually growing the fastest.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the largest glacier there.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
In Washington state, I
imagine everybody remembers

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
the eruption of
Mount St. Helens.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, when Mount St. Helens
erupted, there was a lot of ice

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:90%
on top of Mount St. Helens.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:90%
There were glaciers there.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that eruption
melted those glaciers,

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.859 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, this
huge slurry of mud and ice

00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:02.525 align:middle line:90%
and bulldozers--

00:17:02.525 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keeps sliding down

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.816 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: --trees and
everything was going down

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:90%
the Toutle River.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't hear
about this much anymore,

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
but the glacier in
Mount St. Helens

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.690 align:middle line:90%
has been growing ever since.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The glacier in Mount St.
Helens in the caldera

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.330 align:middle line:90%
is called Crater Glacier.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:28.007 align:middle line:84%
It is now a bigger than it
was before the eruption.

00:17:28.007 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:90%
But again we don't--

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody
talks about that.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: We don't
hear about that.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.700 align:middle line:84%
But I've talked with geologists
there that are studying it,

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.779 align:middle line:90%
and yeah, it's growing.

00:17:35.779 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that an indicator
that there are certain regions,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.299 align:middle line:84%
then, that could be
in this mini ice age?

00:17:41.299 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: I don't
know about that one.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been there
myself to see it.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much of
it's in shadow or not.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But other glaciers are
growing, like on Mount Rainier,

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.420 align:middle line:90%
there's the Nisqually Glacier.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the most major glacier
probably in the United States,

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.250 align:middle line:84%
because the city of Tacoma
gets some of its water supply

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:90%
from Nisqually.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:90%
So they've been measuring it.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Now the bottom of the glacier,
the foot of the glacier,

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:90%
is receding.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But on top, it's
growing thicker.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
just a matter of time

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
until it starts
going down again.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And in northern
Washington state,

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:84%
the glaciers on Mount
Shuksan are growing.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Glacier Peak-- they're growing.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Canada-- on Canada's largest
mountain, Mount Logan,

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it is, the
glaciers are growing there.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Glaciers are growing-- so
not just the United States,

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:90%
but around the world.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You believe that sea
levels will sink, not rise.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Absolutely.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.158 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:18:42.158 --> 00:18:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, we hear all of
this talk about the rising sea

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
levels, and they have
risen a little bit.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But in 2010, again you
don't hear about this,

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:84%
but satellite measurements
show that sea levels in 2010

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.590 align:middle line:90%
lowered by just a little bit.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.699 align:middle line:90%
And in 2011, they lowered--

00:19:00.699 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How can this be?

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, doesn't
surprise me at all.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
During the last
ice age, sea levels

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.016 align:middle line:84%
were actually 350 feet lower
than they are right now.

00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a big drop.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.765 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: It is.

00:19:11.765 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, I mean Canada was
covered with two miles of ice.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Where do you get the moisture
to build up those ice

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:90%
sheets except from the ocean?

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, during the
last ice age, the Bering Strait,

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.930 align:middle line:84%
which is only 270 feet
deep, the Bering Strait

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:90%
was actually above water.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And it created a
giant land bridge.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Alaska at that
time was twice as big

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
as it is now, twice
as much land now.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Siberia and Alaska
were connected.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So our ancestors could
have walked across.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:84%
They could've walked
across, absolutely.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:90%
So I see as we're--

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or at
least skated across.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Skated, there you go.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:90%
But no, it was dry land.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is, it's interesting,

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
is that even though
Canada was covered

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
by one to two miles of
ice, a lot of Alaska

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:84%
had very-- not much more
ice than they do right now.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I think probably
the Pacific Ocean

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:90%
kept that a little bit better.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, our ancestors
could have walked here.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But that's why I think sea
levels are going to go down.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.450 align:middle line:90%
They have to go down.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Because as the ice
builds up on land,

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.310 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
water comes from.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I think you've had
people on your show that

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.520 align:middle line:84%
talk about areas in
Japan where they found

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:84%
ancient cities like 100
feet below the water.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely agree
that that's possible.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Because, yeah, sea levels
were that much lower.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Incredible mysteries.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit
about magnetic reversals.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:90%
What do they mean?

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: OK, magnetic reversal.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:84%
That's a time in the
past when, actually,

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:51.132 align:middle line:84%
when compasses would have
pointed toward the Antarctic

00:20:51.132 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:90%
instead of toward the Arctic.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
is happening again.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.324 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: This is
happening again.

00:20:55.324 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's happened over and
over throughout history.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:90%
This is not something new.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And scientists figure
that probably half

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.826 align:middle line:84%
of our history, the magnetic
field has been reversed.

00:21:05.826 --> 00:21:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's the
significance of that?

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, I think
that, as near as I can tell,

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I see that magnetic reversals--
and this one I'm more alone.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm more hanging
out there this time.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But I see magnetic reversals as
correlating with extinctions.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And I also see
magnetic reversals

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:90%
as correlating with ice ages.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll give the example.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 11,500
years ago, we went

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:84%
into a short period
of glaciation.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And that matches
almost perfectly

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.710 align:middle line:84%
with what is known as the
Gothenburg magnetic reversal.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, when they
drilled and look at their cores,

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:84%
they see that there was a
magnetic reversal at about

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:90%
that time.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of the paperwork
that I read, still today, says

00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:84%
the last magnetic reversal
was like 250,000 years ago.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll see another one that says
it was a million years ago.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm including what's known
as magnetic excursions, where

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.290 align:middle line:84%
the North Pole actually
moves south, and then

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.567 align:middle line:90%
went back up sometimes.

00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:15.150 align:middle line:90%
It fluctuates.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.733 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:90%
And does it go all the way down?

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.993 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Sometimes it
goes all the way down.

00:22:18.993 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that it does, as we

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:84%
head into a magnetic reversal,
is that the magnetic field

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:84%
strength declines,
declines, declines.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.107 align:middle line:84%
Now in my book-- and this is
what was known in the 1990s,

00:22:32.107 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:90%
but things have come a long way.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But back then scientists
said that our magnetic field

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
was declining at about the
rate of 5% per century.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.997 align:middle line:84%
So at that rate, they figured
we're headed for another--

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a little
faster now, isn't it?

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.621 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Now, yeah.

00:22:48.621 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a-- and this just
came out in July of 2014.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The European Space
Agency created

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:84%
a program called Swarm, where
they put three satellites up

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:90%
that could triangulate.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And they have
discovered that, instead

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:11.610 align:middle line:84%
of declining 5% per century,
our magnetic field strength

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.495 align:middle line:84%
is actually declining
5% every decade.

00:23:14.495 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's 10 times faster.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: 10 times faster
than anybody thought.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And they just discovered
that now-- well, in July.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So that gives us an indication--
the Swarm manager believes

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that is an indication
that we are now

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:90%
headed for a magnetic reversal.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, once
we do, what does that mean?

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, birds use
magnetism for traveling.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is everything
going to be upside down?

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.104 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to
be all screwed up?

00:23:46.104 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: I don't know.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.959 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the Earth
flips upside down.

00:23:49.959 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
not a physical flip.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: No, I don't think
there's a physical flip.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:84%
But the magnetic
north does move south.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are some airports
that have made adjustments

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.572 align:middle line:84%
to that already because
of GPS tracking, right?

00:24:05.572 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Yeah, they've
had to make adjustments.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
They have signs up
there for the pilots

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.780 align:middle line:84%
when they're landing to know
what heading they should have.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And they've had to
change the signs just

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:90%
in the last five years.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:90%
So it is changing.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And I guess ship
captains have to adjust

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.597 align:middle line:90%
what they're piloting.

00:24:21.597 --> 00:24:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something is happening.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.263 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Something is happening.

00:24:24.263 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And I see all of
these extinctions that

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.660 align:middle line:84%
correlate with
magnetic reversals.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
I had mentioned the
Gothenburg magnetic reversion,

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:90%
or excursion.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was another
magnetic reversal

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.850 align:middle line:84%
called Mono Lake
magnetic reversal.

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:90%
That was 23,000 years ago.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:84%
We had a huge glaciation at
that time, a big extinction.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.430 align:middle line:84%
33,500 years ago there was
one called the Lake Mungo

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:90%
magnetic reversal.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And that correlates
with-- some scientists

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:84%
say that correlates with the
extension of the neanderthal,

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.070 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:84%
There was Laschamp
magnetic reversal.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:90%
There was the Blake.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.779 align:middle line:90%
That was 115,000 years ago.

00:25:08.779 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think
it's all tied to ice ages.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.778 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Oh absolutely.

00:25:11.778 --> 00:25:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Because every single one
of these does correlate.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a
scientist that used

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
to be with NASA,
Michael Rampino.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And he made studies,
and he said that each

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
of those catastrophic
glaciations

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
could have been triggered
by the magnetic reversal.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
core within the planet that

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:36.110 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the magnetic
field slows and then reverses?

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Is that what's
causing this reversal?

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: No, I don't
know that part.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.814 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something is.

00:25:42.814 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Something is.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I go for
is something that's

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:84%
called precession
of the equinoxes.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:50.805 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:25:50.805 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
celestial, right?

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:52.971 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Celestial.

00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not--
this is not mine.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.550 align:middle line:84%
This was discovered
many years ago.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Milankovitch cycle.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.060 align:middle line:84%
It's also known as
pacemaker of the ice ages.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if I can
explain this a little bit.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.700 align:middle line:84%
With precession of the
equinoxes, right now

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.459 align:middle line:84%
our axis of rotation,
if you could

00:26:12.459 --> 00:26:14.250 align:middle line:84%
put a stick all the
way through the earth--

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:15.666 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're
tilted it a little.

00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Yeah, we're tilted
about 23 and a half degrees.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, right now,
is that our axis of rotation

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:84%
points toward the star
Polaris, toward the North Star.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
don't realize

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.160 align:middle line:84%
is that slowly rotates so
that our axis of rotation,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:84%
it takes about 26,000
years for axis of--

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For that cycle.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: --rotation.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:90%
It goes a way around.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
other part, though,

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:84%
is that because our solar
system is also revolving, then

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:84%
in relation to the solar system,
that takes about 23,000 years.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So 11,500 years
from now, that will

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
be pointing toward
the star Vega.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:84%
11,500 years from then, it'll
be back toward Polaris again.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, somehow we
have these ice ages

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.870 align:middle line:84%
that correlate with
each end of that orbit.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.970 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's your barometer.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.621 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: I don't
know how it happens.

00:27:12.621 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:84%
But somehow it
correlates with that.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.836 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking that
there's some flip that

00:27:18.836 --> 00:27:21.085 align:middle line:84%
goes on when we're in a
certain alignment with the sun

00:27:21.085 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
that all of a sudden
makes it go the other way.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it has
something to do with it.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
The big thing is
what's causing it.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Is it the sun that changes
the magnetic poles for us?

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it has to
do with the core.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Something's going
within the planet.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.630 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:90%
And it does rotate.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Yes, it does.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.291 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it slows down
and then goes the other way.

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: It could.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.765 align:middle line:84%
What I look at is we're living
in an electromagnetic universe.

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, we are.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: And the Earth
is electromagnetic.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:90%
The sun is electromagnetic.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just think it
all ties together.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.245 align:middle line:84%
There's another thing, though,
that's ties in with the sun

00:27:57.245 --> 00:27:57.745 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:27:57.745 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:90%
It's called orbital stretch.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And our-- we have ice ages
that correlate with this thing

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:90%
called orbital stretch.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.200 align:middle line:84%
About every 105,000
years, we have

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
what's known as a
really major ice age.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, what this
orbital stretch is

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:84%
is that our orbit, the
earth's orbit around the sun,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.520 align:middle line:90%
is not a perfect circle.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.505 align:middle line:90%
It's elliptical.

00:28:22.505 --> 00:28:23.300 align:middle line:90%
It stretches.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's
almost a perfect circle.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it stretches out to
be more of an elliptical shape.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And that process
of orbital stretch

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:90%
takes about 105,000 years.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, we
have a major ice age

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.992 align:middle line:90%
every 105,000 years.

00:28:39.992 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then here we go.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: And the thing is, I've
mentioned the 180-year cycle,

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:50.470 align:middle line:84%
the 360 year, the
1440, the 11,500.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:54.680 align:middle line:84%
All of these cycles
are due right now.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.442 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying there's
really no choice.

00:28:57.442 --> 00:28:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we doomed?

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, we've
lived through other ones.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So no, I don't
think we're doomed.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we never had
the kind of technology

00:29:05.639 --> 00:29:08.983 align:middle line:84%
that we have today that was
so dependent on environment.

00:29:08.983 --> 00:29:10.640 align:middle line:90%


00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Things could get shut down.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FELIX: Well, for instance,
during the little ice age,

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.320 align:middle line:84%
literally millions of
people died of starvation,

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.260 align:middle line:90%
literally millions.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.509 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Multiply
that times 10 or 100.

00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: Yes.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:10%
But the thing is is
that back then, they

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:30.440 align:middle line:10%
didn't have the kind of
transportation we have now.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:10%
So back then they had to
depend on local sources

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:10%
for their food.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.890 align:middle line:10%
Today we can bring in food
from all over the world,

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:10%
or the various places can.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.024 align:middle line:84%
Back then, they had no
way of being warned.

00:29:44.024 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if
you can't travel--

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.065 align:middle line:90%
>>FELIX: If you can't travel--

00:29:46.065 --> 00:29:47.106 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't do it.

00:29:47.106 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Robert, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:10%
It's called "Not by
Fire but by Ice,"

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:10%
the ice age that Robert
believes we are in right now.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:58.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:90%
