>>GEORGE NOORY: You are
an expert on the occult.

00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:13.730 align:middle line:84%
That gives you the impression
there's something bad there.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ: It all
depends on how you use it.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:10%
And there's a scale of ethics.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Where you fall on that scale
determines who you are.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have this ability
to concentrate on things,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.320 align:middle line:90%
prayer, manifestation.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I take a
radical approach to prayer.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Thought itself is
a tool of creation.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that
in our generation,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:84%
we may not need ritual
and ceremony anymore

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:90%
to externalize thought.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
The very understanding
that thought

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
is a creative force
may be enough for us

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:90%
to help navigate and use it.

>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:10%
Mitch Horowitz is our special
guest, one of today's most

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:10%
literate voices of
the esoteric mysticism

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:10%
and the occult. Mitch is
an award-winning historian

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:10%
and a writer in residence at
the New York Public Library,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:10%
whose books include "A Cult
America," "One Simple Idea,"

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:10%
and "The Miracle Club."

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:10%
Mitch, welcome to the program.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ:
Thank you, George.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:10%
Great to be here.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, what's it like to
be a resident at the New York

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:10%
Public Library?

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, right
now my residency is remote.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:10%
It's a beautiful building where
I had a wonderful workspace

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:10%
and all kinds of
research privileges,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:10%
and that ended in February.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:10%
So today I am a remote
writer in residence.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You are an
expert on the occult.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, sir.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did
that start for you?

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.012 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It really started
when I was a little kid, thanks

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:36.970 align:middle line:10%
to public libraries.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:10%
When I was a kid
growing up in Queens,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:10%
I was fascinated with
folklore and superstition

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:10%
and all kinds of esoterica.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:10%
I would take out
books on astrology

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:10%
and Native American folklore
and all kinds of subjects

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.367 align:middle line:10%
like that from the library,
and I never looked back once.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You were like me.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I was hooked on
astral projection,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:90%
ghosts, all those things.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I'll never forget.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:10%
One day, my sister brought home
from school a Carlos Castaneda

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.917 align:middle line:10%
paperback, and I was hooked.

00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I never looked back.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was it.

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
hear the word the occult,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and they think it's
dark and bad and evil.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:90%
It's really not, is it?

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.262 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: No, it isn't.

00:02:13.262 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:10%
It comes from the
Latin word occultus.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:10%
It means secret or hidden.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.450 align:middle line:10%
It's a word that came into
usage during the Renaissance,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:10%
when Renaissance writers and
thinkers were rediscovering

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:10%
the spiritual
traditions of antiquity,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:10%
from Egypt, Greece, Rome, and
they referred to these things

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:10%
as the occult.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a song by
Frank Sinatra that deals

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:90%
with that old black magic.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.172 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is black magic?

00:02:35.172 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
traditionally speaking,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:10%
people see black magic as
being something selfish,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.820 align:middle line:10%
something done exclusively for
the self rather than something

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.362 align:middle line:10%
beneficent or for others.

00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:10%
But in this day and age, I
don't make any distinction

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.827 align:middle line:10%
between white and black magic.

00:02:47.827 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a spell
or curse for somebody.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: A spell or a curse.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:84%
I do require in my own practice
ethics and reciprocity.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
we're all connected.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:10%
But as far as reaching for
something for yourself,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:10%
as far as reaching
for attainment,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:10%
I don't see that as bad.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:10%
I don't see that as black magic.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:10%
As long as you're not
doing any kind of violence

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:10%
to another person.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the Indiana
Jones movies pop out,

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
it surrounds the occult.
That gives you the impression

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:90%
there's something bad there.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.773 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It does
give you the impression,

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
but the truth is the occult is
like any other human vehicle,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
whether it's debt spending,
or whether it's drugs,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:84%
or what have you, it all
depends on how you use it.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:10%
I often say that in terms of the
human psyche, there's empathy,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:10%
and there's spite.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:10%
And where a person
falls on that scale

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:10%
is going to determine how they
use the tools in their lives.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they call
it black magic, Mitch?

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I think that black
magic is a designation that's

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:10%
probably outdated
in our own times,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:10%
but it was a
designation that was

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.610 align:middle line:10%
used to talk about
magicians who were

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:10%
casting spells or
manipulating people or curses

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:10%
or things like that.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:10%
To me, there's just magic.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:10%
And there's a scale of ethics.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.758 align:middle line:10%
Where you fall on that scale
determines who you are.

00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Didn't you
just go to Egypt?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.258 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, I did.

00:04:05.258 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:10%
I was in Egypt last year.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm working on a documentary
about an occult book called

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:10%
"The Kybalion," which
was published in 1908.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a collection of
Greek, Egyptian wisdom

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
or an interpretation
of that wisdom.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a mysterious, wonderful,
very powerful book.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And this documentary
that we're working on

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
gets to the roots of
where the book comes from,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and that entailed
going to Egypt.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So we did some of our shooting
in Egypt early last year.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.443 align:middle line:10%
The movie will be out
probably in early 2021.

00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It was a
worthwhile trip?

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.030 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Enormously so.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.230 align:middle line:10%
Enormously so.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.765 align:middle line:10%
Tough to film and
to shoot in Egypt.

00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:10%
Tough to get around in Egypt and
get the things done that you--

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Because of permission?

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.067 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Because
of permission.

00:04:46.067 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very expensive, and truth
be told, we did some of it

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.107 align:middle line:90%
in a sort of pirated fashion.

00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't afford--

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of hid
the camera a little bit.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Exactly.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stuff like that.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And
that's not something

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:90%
you want to get caught doing.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But we went there with
a purpose in mind.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:10%
We couldn't always
afford the licensure.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:10%
And we did everything
that we were able to do.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:10%
It was a wonderful trip.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:10%
We met wonderful people.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And some really mysterious
things happened.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:10%
And the whole story
appears in the documentary.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My late father
was born in Cairo,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:90%
so he used to talk about Egypt.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.863 align:middle line:84%
He left when he was six to
come to the United States.

00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I
wondered about that.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he
felt it was magical.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, it's
a magnificent city.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:10%
It's a chaotic city.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:10%
It's a magnificent city.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:10%
I mean, in many respects,
Egypt is the birthplace

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:10%
of primordial civilization.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:10%
It's the most magical
place on Earth.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
it's much older than what

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:90%
science is telling us?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I really,
truly believe that it is.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:10%
And this is something that
I've explored recently.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:10%
There are two Egyptologists who
you've probably interviewed,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:10%
John Anthony West
and Robert Shoch.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And they theorized
going back to the 1980s

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that the oldest portions
of the Great Sphinx

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:90%
showed water damage.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:10%
And they estimated that
timeline of ancient Egypt

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:10%
went back older than, say, 3,500
BC, maybe as old as 10,000 BC.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:10%
And I think we've seen
enough corroboration

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:10%
to take that thesis
very, very seriously.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:10%
But it hasn't been studied
in the last generation.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:10%
This is what I was
referencing earlier.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:10%
It's very difficult to
get the proper licensure

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:10%
and other things in Egypt.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:10%
So that scent trail
has gone cold,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:10%
and I hope it gets
picked up again.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on that.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Egypt is kind of
surprising and puzzling.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:90%
They have many gods.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they
have so many for?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, you could
look at it in different ways.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:10%
We live under many
laws and forces,

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle line:10%
and our ancient
ancestors were, I think,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:10%
more intimately connected
to nature in certain ways

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:10%
than we are.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:10%
And they personified or
defied certain energies,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:10%
and they worshiped them.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They sought
relationships with them,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Horus or
Seth or Osiris or Isis.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:10%
And they felt that there was a
natural and invisible correlate

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:10%
to everything that we
experience in life,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:10%
and that you can
seek a relationship

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:10%
with that invisible correlate,
which you could even personify.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have a favorite god?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I do.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which one?

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And
that is the god Set,

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:84%
who is the god of
storms and the desert.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spell it.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: S-E-T. Set.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Set.

00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: S-E-T.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: And that
is a god with whom

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:10%
I feel a very deep
personal relationship.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And what is that god?

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: He is the god
of storms, of the desert.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes he's seen as the
god of the dark side, which

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:10%
is the rap that I
will get occasionally.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But again, I don't make a
distinction between dark side

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and light side.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:10%
I make a distinction
between empathy and spite.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:10%
I make a distinction based on
reciprocity, based on ethics.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:10%
He's a god of great power.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:10%
He's a god of great usurpation.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:10%
And I love him, and I seek
a relationship with him.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:90%
That's my personal path.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I've
always known you to be

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.153 align:middle line:90%
a very outstanding person.

00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And even though you
may dabble on the dark side,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't see you as being bad
or evil or anything like that.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I really
believe that there

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:10%
are gods that represent
rebelliousness, upending,

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:10%
revolution, anti-heroism,
and I really

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:10%
identify with those gods.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:10%
But that doesn't mean
that I take some sort

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.330 align:middle line:10%
of a go-it-alone approach.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:10%
I care very deeply about
honor, nobility, ethics,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:10%
protecting other people, valor.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:10%
I would never do something
to hurt another person that

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:10%
wasn't in self-defense.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you dabble
in astrology, Mitch?

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, quite a bit.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Quite a bit.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how has that
led you down your path?

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I take
astrology very seriously.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:10%
I believe in the astrology
that was practiced

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:10%
by figures like Carl Jung and
Henry Miller and D.H. Lawrence.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:10%
All these figures believed
that as the stars are aligned

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:10%
at your time of birth, your
basic natal chart provides

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:10%
a thumbprint of character.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:10%
I have personally found
that to be the case.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:10%
I can't speak exactly to how
that works, what the delivery

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:10%
system is, but there
are so many correlations

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:10%
between physical life
on Earth and the cosmos

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:10%
that it would be
foolish to write off

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:10%
that there's a correlation
between the human mood,

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:10%
the human psyche,
and the positioning

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:10%
of the celestial objects
at our time of birth.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.598 align:middle line:10%
It affects so much in
other areas of life.

00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Years ago, I had
a guest on our program,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Art Rosengarten, who's
an expert in Tarot cards.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And he swears by these things.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I take Tarot
cards very seriously.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:10%
I believe that it is
entirely possible that when

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:10%
you are using a pictogramatic
device like Tarot,

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:10%
you may be taking a
snapshot of the present,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.758 align:middle line:10%
and a kind of
interdimensional snapshot,

00:09:42.758 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:10%
where you're getting a
sense of everything that's

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.490 align:middle line:10%
going on at once.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And Tarot may, in fact,
give you a picture

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
of past, present, future,
frozen for that moment in time.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
a kind of Polaroid

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
shot of what's happening
at that moment.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.272 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch, on the newest
season of Gaia's "Mystery

00:10:00.272 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Teachings," Dr. Theresa Bullard
explains how the Tarot cards

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.818 align:middle line:90%
can lead to self-discovery.

00:10:05.818 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:10%
>>THERESA BULLARD: In this
season of Mystery Teachings,

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:10%
we embark on a journey
of self-discovery

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:10%
and transformation
through the 22 archetypes

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.880 align:middle line:10%
of our multidimensional self.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So a big part of this journey
is about helping us to,

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:84%
one, recognize our
multidimensionality.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
To recognize how these
22 archetypes play

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
in our own life,
but also how they

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.523 align:middle line:84%
play in the life of our
higher self that has these 22

00:10:32.523 --> 00:10:33.565 align:middle line:90%
different parallel lives.

00:10:33.565 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.530 align:middle line:10%
Well, what do we mean
by parallel lives?

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, the idea goes
back to our true self

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:10%
as being something that
is beyond this hologram

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.240 align:middle line:10%
of this physical universe.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:10%
So if we were to
think of our true self

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:10%
as being beyond the hologram,
beyond the quantum sea,

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:10%
in a place metaphysically that
we call the great central sun.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:10%
From that place
of our true self,

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:10%
there are 22 archetypal rays or
aspects of that true self that

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:10%
are sent out through
the universe,

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:10%
and they go to
different planets,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:10%
so each one becomes like a
being on a different planet.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:10%
And then from those
different places

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:10%
where our true self
emanates out to,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:10%
it then reflects those
rays and those energies

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:10%
back to all the other
22 planets again.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:10%
So we have one of those
planets is here on Earth,

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:10%
but we could also be out
in the Sirius system.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.550 align:middle line:10%
We could be out in the Pleiades.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:10%
You know, we could be having
various aspects of ourself

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.390 align:middle line:10%
in 22 different planets.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:10%
And then from those
places, those 22 archetypes

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:10%
get reflected back
here to Earth.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.010 align:middle line:10%
And our higher self that has
its emanations here on Earth

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.810 align:middle line:10%
then has 22 archetypes also
being emanated down to Earth

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:10%
and incarnating.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:10%
So when we say
parallel lives, it's

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:10%
like we have 22 different
aspects of our higher

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:10%
self living out these lives
here on Earth in parallel

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.970 align:middle line:10%
with each other, but they're
either on slightly different

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:10%
frequencies, or they're
just different people

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:10%
who are having a life under a
different archetypal influence.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Dr. Bullard
makes a lot of sense there,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:90%
doesn't she?

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.423 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, she does.

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:10%
I like the points
that she's making,

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:10%
because I agree that the
major trumps of the Tarot deck

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:10%
are an archetypal language.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:10%
They're recognizable
to everybody,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:10%
from every different
culture, walk of life,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:10%
and I would even
say time period.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:10%
If you set the clock back
300 years, for example,

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:10%
and you had a Tarot deck,
and you showed these images

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:10%
to somebody in the
Polynesian Islands

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.667 align:middle line:10%
or somebody in Central Russia
or someone in the South Pacific,

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:10%
every person to whom
you showed these things

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:10%
would recognize those images.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
The devil, the king, the
lovers, the magician.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
These are true
archetypal images.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.657 align:middle line:84%
It is a real language
of the psyche.

00:13:04.657 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty dramatic.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You've got a new book
out on Manly P. Hall.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was he?

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Manly P. Hall
was a great occult scholar.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:10%
He was sort of the dean
of American esoterica.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:10%
He was born in Canada, but
grew up in the American West.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:10%
Spent most of his life
living and working

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:10%
in the city of Los Angeles,
until his death in 1990.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:10%
And he is famous for writing
probably the greatest

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:10%
underground book
in human history,

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.400 align:middle line:10%
and that is "The Secret
Teachings of All Ages."

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It is a massive encyclopedia
of the occult, esoterica,

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:40.940 align:middle line:90%
symbolism.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.665 align:middle line:90%
It came out in 1928.

00:13:42.665 --> 00:13:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And I have a new book
out called "The Seekers

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.332 align:middle line:84%
Guide to the Secret
Teachings of All Ages,"

00:13:46.332 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
where I explore some
of Manly's themes.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But it is a book that you
will lose yourself in,

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:90%
and you will find yourself in.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:84%
People open that book, and
they find a path in life.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just endless in
its possibilities.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it an instructional
manual, basically?

00:14:00.613 --> 00:14:02.780 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's not really
an instructional manual,

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:10%
but it's a catalog.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:10%
It's a beautifully
curated catalog

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:10%
of esoteric and
occult traditions

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:10%
from all throughout the ages.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.970 align:middle line:10%
And you open this book, and
you find chapters on Tarot,

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:10%
on Pythagorean
mathematics, on Atlantis,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:10%
on Egyptian mystery traditions,
and you find yourself in it.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:10%
You find something
you gravitate towards.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.237 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had an effect
on some well-known people.

00:14:28.237 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
through some of these names,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to explain
what kind of indelible effect

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:90%
he had on their lives.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.038 align:middle line:84%
The first, of course, the
late President Ronald Reagan.

00:14:38.038 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:10%
I've been writing about
this for 10 years.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:10%
I found evidence that Reagan and
Hall were not only acquainted,

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:50.060 align:middle line:10%
but Reagan was using
certain of Hall's phrases

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:10%
and ideas and terminology
in his speeches.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the
1950s, the very dawn

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.740 align:middle line:84%
of Reagan's political career,
up through his presidency.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well?

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: [LAUGHS]
Right, exactly.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And I did a text analysis.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:10%
I've written about this
in "The Washington Post"

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of other places.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:10%
There's no question about it.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:10%
Reagan was borrowing
ideas from Manly P. Hall.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody who
I would never thought

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
would have had some of Manly
P. Hall's ideas, the late Osama

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:90%
bin Laden.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.652 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Can you believe it?

00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:10%
There--

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How was
that discovered?

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.365 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Military
intelligence

00:15:22.365 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:10%
after bin Laden was
killed found a copy

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:10%
of "The Secret Teachings of All
Ages" on bin Laden's bookshelf.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.375 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: And you
would ask yourself,

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:10%
what is this book doing there
on bin Laden's bookshelf?

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:10%
Bin Laden and his
movement harbor a lot

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:10%
of conspiracy theories
about Freemasonry

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:10%
and different secret societies.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And they think there are
these hidden hands that

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:84%
are kind of pulling the
strings in the world.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And Manly wrote
about some of that

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
in "The Secret
Teachings of All Ages,"

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
but not in a negative
way, not in the way

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:84%
that Osama bin Laden
might have understood it.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:10%
He saw Freemasonry, for
example, as an organization that

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.520 align:middle line:10%
believed in principles
of individual liberty,

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:10%
ecumenism, religious
freedom, and did believe--

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:10%
I think correctly-- that
masonry played a core role

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.267 align:middle line:10%
in the founding of our nation,
but not in a negative way,

00:16:10.267 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:10%
not in the way that bin Laden
would have interpreted it.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, exactly.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
What did he say about
secret societies?

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: You know,
his secret society thesis

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:10%
is really, really fascinating.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:10%
Manly took a basically positive
view of secret societies,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.565 align:middle line:10%
like the Freemasons--

00:16:25.565 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Unlike now, where
everybody thinks there's

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:10%
something negative going on.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Everybody thinks
there's something negative.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
take a second look.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Take a second look.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:10%
Groups like Freemasonry, the
Rosicrucians, the Historic

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:10%
Illuminati, all these groups
revolved around the idea

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:10%
that the individual
spiritual search was

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:10%
the birthright of all people.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to separate
power from the aristocracy.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.180 align:middle line:10%
They wanted a separation
of church and state.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:10%
They believed that
the individual

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:10%
had a birthright
to search according

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:10%
to his or her own lights.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:10%
Manly believed that
these secret societies

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:10%
vouchsafed ancient ideas
and eventually helped

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:10%
bring them to light in the
founding of the United States.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
It is a fact that an inordinate
number of our founders,

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.567 align:middle line:84%
including Washington and Ben
Franklin, were Freemasons.

00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.470 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: And this runs
throughout our history.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:10%
Historians,
mainstream historians,

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:10%
are only just now coming
to recognize this.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:10%
But Manly was writing about this
in the early 20th century, when

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:10%
it was not widely acknowledged.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did
Manly get so tuned in?

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: That is a real
question for the ages.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:10%
Because he published "The
Secret Teachings of All Ages"

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:10%
when he was only 27 years old.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, how
could a 27-year-old

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:90%
get that kind of experience?

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Isn't it something?

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:84%
You can't get most 27-year-olds
to leave their room now,

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:90%
to turn off Xbox.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And Manly created--

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It's also that dangerous
age with all those rock

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:90%
stars that died.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.372 align:middle line:90%
27, 27, 27.

00:17:50.372 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: 27.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:90%
And he peaked.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:10%
He peaked very, very young.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:10%
He created one of the
really extraordinary works

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:10%
of esoteric wisdom of all
time at a very young age.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:10%
And it can justly
be called a mystery.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:10%
He didn't have a
traditional education.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:10%
He was raised by his grandmother
in the American West.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:10%
He never had any
formal schooling

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.500 align:middle line:10%
but for he was in a military
academy in New York City,

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:10%
just for maybe 18
months or so, otherwise

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:10%
had no formal schooling.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:10%
The question of how Manly
accomplished what he did

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:10%
is not an ordinary question.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a mystery there.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.203 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:18:26.203 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some
images, Mitch,

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and have you explain
what we're looking at.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
The first would be
"Gnostic Pathos One."

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Ah.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Is the Gnostic God
Abraxas, who was worshipped

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle line:84%
by different sects in
the Mediterranean Basin

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
in the decades following
the death of Christ.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of man
and beast, a combination

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:90%
of higher and lower.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the serpents for
feet, of course the cock's head

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:90%
in the place of the human head.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the idea like the centaur.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea of combining
the energies of both

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
the animalistic and the
intellectual together into one

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.922 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at the next image

00:19:04.922 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:90%
and see what we have here.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Ah.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:84%
The Nordic Tree of
Life, Yggdrasil.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a wonderful
image that runs

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
throughout Nordic mythology
in which there is thought

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
to be a great cosmic
tree that holds up

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
the underworld, our world,
Middle Earth, and the heavens.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And this cosmic tree-- and this
will sound familiar to many

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:90%
of your viewers--

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
has a serpent wrapped
around it, a serpent

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of wisdom, a serpent that
can ensnare you and hurt you,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
or a serpent that
can enlighten you.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.068 align:middle line:84%
So you find the
idea of the serpent

00:19:39.068 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:84%
runs through all religious
traditions around the world.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who created
these graphics, Mitch?

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.025 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: These
graphics were created

00:19:45.025 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:10%
by an artist named J.
Augustus Knapp, whose

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:84%
work runs throughout "The
Secret Teachings of All Ages."

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:10%
He had been a commercial
artist, a man largely involved

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:10%
in the advertising
world, with the exception

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.280 align:middle line:10%
of a novel that he illustrated.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:10%
And he wanted to get
into the esoteric,

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.905 align:middle line:10%
and Manly said, come with me.

00:20:01.905 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:90%
The next one is?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Ah, this is one
of the iterations of Mithra.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
A lion, a man with
a lion's head.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.250 align:middle line:84%
This god, Mithra, was one
of the major, major gods

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:90%
of the Persian world.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
bowing down to him.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.725 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: They're
bowing down to him.

00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
He is a god who
controls creation.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:84%
He is holding up eight
stars which are considered

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:90%
the eight energies of life.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, he too, you see,
is wrapped by a serpent.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:84%
We think of a serpent as evil
today in the modern West,

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:84%
but many religious traditions,
including early Judaism,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
saw a serpent as a
bestower of wisdom.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And Mithra was one of the major
religions of the Persian world.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.160 align:middle line:10%
The Roman Empire
encountered it and

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:10%
incorporated Mithraic practices
into many of its own beliefs.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And isn't the serpent
being used for medical symbols,

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:90%
too?

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.535 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The
serpent started getting

00:20:53.535 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
used as a medical symbol,
believe it or not,

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:90%
in the First World War.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:10%
Because the serpent,
at that time,

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.080 align:middle line:10%
was considered a symbol
of the god Mercury.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.480 align:middle line:10%
And it was considered a
symbol of safe passage.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:10%
And ambulances, American
ambulances, in the First World

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.425 align:middle line:10%
War, would use a serpent as
a symbol of safe passage,

00:21:14.425 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:10%
and it later became
associated with medicine.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And this image.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.340 align:middle line:90%
What is this, Mitch?

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.173 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Ah, this
is Hermes Trismegistus,

00:21:20.173 --> 00:21:21.640 align:middle line:90%
the thrice greatest Hermes.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
This was the name
that the Greeks

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:84%
gave to the Egyptian
God of Intellect, Thoth.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
They called him three times
as great as our Hermes,

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:90%
thrice greatest.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And they saw him as the giver of
wisdom, the giver of intellect,

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.652 align:middle line:90%
the giver of writing.

00:21:35.652 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:10%
And of course you'll see the
caduceus, the one with the two

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:10%
serpents wrapped around
it, a wand of safe passage,

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:10%
and a wand of wisdom.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's that
thing under his chin?

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh,
well, he has a beard,

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and he also has an ankh
hanging from his neck, which

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:90%
is the Egyptian symbol of life.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
You have a positive
and a negative and then

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:84%
a reconciling, indicated by
the circle atop the ankh.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would there be
a little picture of a dog?

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.480 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, that is
a wonderful question.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:07.150 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks saw dogs as
creatures of great loyalty.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Hebrew word
for dog is Caleb,

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%
which is the name that
I gave to my older

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:90%
son, which also means loyalty.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
fire dragon seems

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:84%
to be trying to blow
him up or something.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:84%
That is supposed
to be Typhon, which

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.390 align:middle line:84%
is considered the
Egyptian symbol of evil,

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:90%
and he's mastering evil.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.410 align:middle line:84%
But seen in another
way, he's also

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.622 align:middle line:84%
incorporating both positive
and negative forces.

00:22:31.622 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the fact
that he's standing on top

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.942 align:middle line:90%
of the creature tells you what?

00:22:34.942 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
it's interesting.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that that
same image later

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:84%
got adopted into
our own guardian

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:84%
image of Saint Michael, who
is often depicted as standing

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:90%
on top of a serpent.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Metaphysically
speaking,

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
what's the significance
of all these pictures?

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: These pictures
are really representations

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:10%
of the human psyche.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.320 align:middle line:10%
We are a polarity.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:10%
We have all these different
tendencies in ourselves

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:10%
that we're constantly
struggling in between.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:10%
And one of the great teachings
of ancient hermetic philosophy

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:10%
or Greek Egyptian philosophy is
that your emotions, your moods,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:10%
are on a kind of sliding scale.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:10%
And if you're in a certain mood
that you want to get beyond,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:10%
by focusing on its opposite-- if
you can identify its opposite,

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:10%
which is not always so easy--

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:10%
by focusing on its opposite,
you can psychically

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:10%
slide the scale.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:10%
We are creatures
of polarity, and we

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:10%
can move along that polarity.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch,
over the years, I've

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:84%
found you to be a
very upbeat person.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
We get a lot of great
response on the radio program

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.520 align:middle line:90%
when you're on.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we're going to get a
lot with "Beyond Belief," here.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
What is your 10-Day
Miracle Challenge?

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.930 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Ah, The
10-Day Miracle Challenge

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.480 align:middle line:10%
is a mental exercise.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:10%
It's an exercise in
mental metaphysics

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:10%
to get something that
you urgently need

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:10%
within a fixed period of time.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:10%
It's very simple.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:10%
You decide on the
thing that you need.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:10%
You make sure you're
absolutely passionate about it.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:10%
You write it down, and then you
make these 10 boxes, basically.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Affirmations?

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: The 10
boxes represent 10 days

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:10%
in which you focus on this.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:10%
You can use affirmations,
visualizations, prayers--

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Dreams.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Spells,
dreams, anything you want.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:10%
Your goal is to
focus on that thing

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.050 align:middle line:10%
that you need within the
space of these 10 days.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:10%
And the key thing is, the
pivot point of the exercise

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:10%
is this, watch
very, very carefully

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.560 align:middle line:10%
for the arrival of the
thing you're looking for.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.330 align:middle line:10%
Because very often, miraculous
things enter our lives,

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:10%
and we overlook them because
they come to us in ways that

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.890 align:middle line:10%
are unexpected, that
don't fit our mind's eye

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:10%
image, that seem too familiar,
and we close the door on them.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It's an exercise in being
very, very watchful,

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and don't neglect
any possibilities.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Because miracles come in one
door and go out the other,

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%
and we overlook them.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.525 align:middle line:84%
And this is a time, for these
10 days, to be very watchful.

00:25:01.525 --> 00:25:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think is one

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
of the most important things we
should do to improve ourselves?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: George, I believe
that the most important thing

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.910 align:middle line:10%
a person can do to improve
him or herself is to determine

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:10%
to get away from cruel people.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:10%
I don't think we talk about
this enough in our lives.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cruel being negative?

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Cruel
being negative.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:23.725 align:middle line:90%
People who bully you.

00:25:23.725 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:90%
People who run you down.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.025 align:middle line:84%
People who make diminishing
comments about you.

00:25:28.025 --> 00:25:30.440 align:middle line:10%
People who just make
you feel absolutely

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:10%
constricted and afraid.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.080 align:middle line:90%
We don't talk enough about it.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:90%
We don't talk enough about it.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always a problem.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: We're always
being told-- it's a problem.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Therapists and ministers and
other folk would say, well,

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:90%
you have to change yourself.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And yes, changing of
self is necessary.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:90%
But we wither.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.190 align:middle line:84%
We wither under the
influence of cruel people.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:10%
If you can't get away
from a cruel person,

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:10%
make the inner vow that you
will separate from them within,

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.380 align:middle line:10%
and you will get away from
them as a physical fact

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:10%
at the first
possible opportunity.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:10%
But I see people's
lives just wither

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:10%
under the influence of cruelty.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's vitally important to
get away from cruel people.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.340 align:middle line:10%
Your life will open up in ways
that you may never expect.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You shut down
your Facebook page.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I did.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How come?

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I found too
much negativity on Facebook.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:10%
And I also found there wasn't
enough room for experimentation

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:10%
on Facebook.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe that
our job as seekers

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:10%
is just to repeat
whatever we've heard,

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:10%
whatever has been passed down
to us through translations

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:10%
of translations of
spiritual literature.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I want people to verify
everything for themselves.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't find enough of a spirit
of experiment on Facebook.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm on Instagram and
Twitter, but I found

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Facebook counterproductive.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So far.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.890 align:middle line:90%
So far.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: So far.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm liking it, so I
think I'll stick around.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are you a
believer in prayer, Mitch,

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:10%
to get things done?

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.818 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:26:48.818 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.990 align:middle line:10%
Not only am I a
believer in prayer,

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:10%
but I take a radical
approach to prayer.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:10%
There is no wrong way to do it.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:10%
There is no wrong
way to approach it.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:10%
Some people say you
have to pray believing

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:10%
that you've already received.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:10%
If a person abides by scripture,
you can look in scripture

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.090 align:middle line:10%
and see that the matriarchs
and the patriarchs,

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:10%
they prayed in
all kinds of ways.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:10%
They demanded things of God.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:10%
They got into fights with God.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:10%
There are all kinds
of ways to pray.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
You can also pray to
a different deity,

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
as we were talking
about earlier.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:84%
You can forge a
relationship with any figure

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
from the pantheon
of ancient gods

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
that you feel some sympathy
with or affinity towards.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:90%
See what happens.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Experiment.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Be radical.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Be bold.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't there a biblical
saying, such it is written,

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.295 align:middle line:90%
so it shall be?

00:27:34.295 --> 00:27:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: So it is
written, so it shall be.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:10%
And I take very seriously
writing things down, actually.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:10%
I think that physically writing
down a prayer or an affirmation

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:10%
is very important.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.350 align:middle line:10%
Not doing it just on a
tablet or on a computer,

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.840 align:middle line:10%
but writing it down with an
old-fashioned pencil and paper.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And just looking at it.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Reading it.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.962 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It's looking at it.

00:27:53.962 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:10%
However small a step
that is, however

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:10%
nascent a step that is, you
have, in some small way,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:10%
altered reality.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:10%
You've created something
physical and tactile

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:10%
that wasn't there before.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia program,
"Rewired," Dr. Joe Dispenza

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
explains just how our
repetitive thoughts

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:84%
can lead to the same actions
and same outcomes of our life.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE DISPENZA: What is change?

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:10%
Let's assume that
your thoughts have

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.080 align:middle line:10%
something to do with your
destiny or your future.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.920 align:middle line:10%
That you believe that your
thoughts create your life.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
I mentioned that you

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.760 align:middle line:84%
think 60,000 to 70,000
thoughts in one day.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And 90% of those thoughts are
the same thoughts as the day

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:10%
So if you believe that your
thoughts have something

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:10%
to do with your future,
and 90% of those thoughts

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.570 align:middle line:10%
are exactly the same
as the day before,

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:10%
and it makes sense then
your life or your future

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:10%
isn't going to change very much.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:10%
Because the same thoughts
always lead to the same choices.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:03.380 align:middle line:10%
The same choices always
lead to the same behaviors.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:10%
The same behaviors create
the exact same experiences.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And the same experiences
produce the same emotions.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And those same emotions
begin to influence

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.000 align:middle line:90%
your very same thoughts.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And everything in your
biology stays the same.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Your neural circuitry, your
neurochemistry, your hormones,

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and even your gene expression
is equal to how you think,

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.770 align:middle line:90%
how you act, and how you feel.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And how you think, how
you act, and how you feel

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.410 align:middle line:90%
is called your personality.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And your personality
is intimately

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:84%
connected to your life
or your personal reality.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Reason this with me.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a principle in
neuroscience called Hebb's Law.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And Hebb's Law says that
nerve cells that fire together

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:90%
wire together.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep thinking
the same thoughts,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:84%
making the same
choices, demonstrating

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:84%
the same behaviors, creating
the same experiences,

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and producing the same feelings
and emotions for the last 10

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.130 align:middle line:84%
years, it makes
sense then you're

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.640 align:middle line:84%
going to begin to hardwire
your brain into a very

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.950 align:middle line:90%
finite signature.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And that box in your brain, by
the time you're 35 years old,

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.820 align:middle line:84%
becomes a very hardwired
set of programs that becomes

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:90%
your identity or personality.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And that 35-year-old mark
means that most people,

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.210 align:middle line:84%
by the time they
reach that age, become

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:90%
a set of memorized behaviors.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:10%
Unconscious emotional reactions.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.390 align:middle line:10%
Automatic habits.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:10%
Hardwired attitudes, beliefs,
and perceptions that function

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:10%
just like a computer program.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like Joe.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.383 align:middle line:90%
I like what he has to say.

00:30:56.383 --> 00:30:57.342 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:30:57.342 --> 00:30:58.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He's spot on.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: That
segment was magnificent.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:10%
That is our life.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:10%
And we know through brain scans
that repeat thoughts actually

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.978 align:middle line:10%
alter the cellular
matter of our brain.

00:31:10.978 --> 00:31:12.520 align:middle line:10%
They alter the
pathways through which

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:10%
electrical impulses, neural
impulses, travel in our brain.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:90%
This is absolute fact.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The challenge that
we face is how

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.540 align:middle line:84%
to disrupt these
thought patterns,

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.220 align:middle line:90%
these negative thought patterns.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I want people,
when they hear something,

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:84%
not just to accept it, but
to work to verify everything

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:90%
We have to experiment.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.820 align:middle line:84%
We have to do things that are
going to disrupt the familiar.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.430 align:middle line:10%
Everybody watches that
segment, and Joe just

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.500 align:middle line:10%
articulated it beautifully.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.920 align:middle line:10%
All your viewers, like me, are
agreeing and saying, right on.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.060 align:middle line:10%
That's correct.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:10%
But how?

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.420 align:middle line:10%
How do we disrupt these
habitual thoughts?

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.240 align:middle line:10%
We have to come up with
ways of experimenting,

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:10%
of challenging ourselves,
even of creating friction

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.090 align:middle line:10%
in our lives in
order to challenge

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.710 align:middle line:10%
these ordinary thought patterns.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by creating
this friction, what

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:90%
does that do to us?

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Does it tear us apart?

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Sometimes
we may feel torn apart.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:10.690 align:middle line:84%
The Persian poet, Rumi, wrote,
pray for a tough instructor.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.210 align:middle line:10%
I think sometimes we
need to be torn apart.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.080 align:middle line:10%
Before we sat down together, we
were talking about bicycling.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.520 align:middle line:10%
I bicycle everywhere
in New York.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.990 align:middle line:10%
I bicycle in terrible weather.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.420 align:middle line:10%
I bicycle in near hurricanes.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:10%
I bicycle in blizzards.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:10%
I wear a helmet too.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.940 align:middle line:10%
But I try to do things
that will get me out

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:10%
of the pattern of the familiar.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:32.200 align:middle line:10%
It can feel rough, but
we've got to disrupt

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.340 align:middle line:10%
these repetitive thoughts.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:10%
We can't just agree with Joe--

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.140 align:middle line:10%
which I do-- we have to
act on what Joe is saying.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And if you do that,
does it change your life?

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.588 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It has
changed my life.

00:32:43.588 --> 00:32:44.388 align:middle line:10%
I--

00:32:44.388 --> 00:32:46.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've always known
you to be upbeat, always.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.030 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: [LAUGHS] I
have my moments, George.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.590 align:middle line:10%
I can assure you,
I have my moments

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:10%
where I'm staring at the ceiling
at 4 o'clock in the morning.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do you pull
yourself out of that?

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
sometimes, first of all,

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.930 align:middle line:10%
you have to realize that
there are negative thoughts

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.090 align:middle line:10%
storms that you just
have to deal with.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.590 align:middle line:10%
Our psyches are
like the weather,

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.470 align:middle line:10%
and things come and go, and we
cannot always struggle against

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:06.270 align:middle line:10%
them.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.280 align:middle line:10%
But I would say you
have to throw yourself

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:10%
into the unexpected.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.560 align:middle line:10%
And it can be uncomfortable,
and it can be difficult,

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.050 align:middle line:10%
but if you take
the same actions,

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:15.633 align:middle line:10%
your thoughts are
not going to change.

00:33:15.633 --> 00:33:17.780 align:middle line:84%
We want things to go
easy for ourselves.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.640 align:middle line:90%
We want to be warm.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:90%
We want to be comfortable.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:90%
We like the familiar.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's only by
disrupting the familiar

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes putting
ourselves into a situation

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that either feels scary
or difficult or physically

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.380 align:middle line:84%
challenging or
that's just unusual.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:10%
Only through that can we push
back against repetitive thought

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:10%
patterns.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In spite of the fact
that you have this ability

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate on things,
prayer, manifestation,

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.175 align:middle line:84%
you still get involved in
things that can pull you down.

00:33:47.175 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh,
without question.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
because you're human?

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.650 align:middle line:90%
What causes that?

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's because we're
human, and we live in a world

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.270 align:middle line:10%
that this is a tough
life, and things

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:10%
are very difficult for people.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I understand why
people turn to the bottle.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.150 align:middle line:10%
I understand why
people turn to drugs.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:10%
I understand why people zone out
in front of the television set.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:10%
But it's just so
critically important

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:08.290 align:middle line:10%
not to get lost in that.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.239 align:middle line:10%
Permit yourself some of that.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there's always
an upside, isn't there,

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to be able to pull
yourself out of that.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.978 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: If you can
pull yourself out of it,

00:34:15.978 --> 00:34:17.840 align:middle line:10%
you never know what will happen.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:10%
I always say to people, we all
acknowledge that our behaviors

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.320 align:middle line:10%
can invite catastrophe.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.639 align:middle line:10%
Nobody questions that.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.890 align:middle line:10%
Those same behaviors can
also invite the miraculous

00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:28.900 align:middle line:10%
and invite the unexpected.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.000 align:middle line:10%
Take that dimension within
yourself very seriously.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch, what do
you think of meditation?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.219 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I
meditate twice a day.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I use transcendental
meditation, which

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.859 align:middle line:84%
is a mantra-based
form of meditation.

00:34:39.859 --> 00:34:40.659 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long?

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:41.617 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: 20 minutes.

00:34:41.617 --> 00:34:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Just two 20-minute sessions.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.870 align:middle line:90%
It's super easy.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quiet?

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Quiet.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:10%
It's relaxing.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.340 align:middle line:10%
It's a vital part of my life.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.830 align:middle line:10%
I've gone through phases
where I've stopped meditating.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.300 align:middle line:10%
I experiment with
different things.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.117 align:middle line:10%
I disrupt my practice.

00:34:54.117 --> 00:34:56.409 align:middle line:10%
I went through a period of
time where for about a year,

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:57.460 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't meditating.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:10%
But the stress was too
great, and I went back to it.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are UFOs
part of the occult?

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.630 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: UFOs,
strictly speaking,

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.330 align:middle line:10%
are not part of the
occult, but they open up

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.900 align:middle line:10%
so many wonderful questions
into extra physicality,

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.870 align:middle line:10%
interdimensionality, and
we are living in a time

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:10%
right now where UFOs
have gone mainstream.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.620 align:middle line:10%
No serious person thinks
that cockpit videos of UFOs

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.065 align:middle line:10%
are just some sort
of natural phenomena

00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:24.190 align:middle line:10%
that's being misunderstood.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:10%
It's engineered phenomena.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's going on.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ:
Something's going on.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Where it is, where it
comes from, we do not know.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But when you open the
door to those questions,

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.480 align:middle line:84%
if you take seriously the
interdimensional thesis,

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.760 align:middle line:84%
which I do, you open up
the door to all kinds

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.080 align:middle line:90%
of extra physical questions.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.175 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is "Kybalion"?

00:35:40.175 --> 00:35:41.800 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: "Kybalion,"
we don't really

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.090 align:middle line:10%
know what the word means.

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:10%
The author never defined it.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:10%
It's probably a Greek
inflection of the word [GREEK]..

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.530 align:middle line:10%
But "The Kybalion" is a work
that was published in 1908.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:10%
And it is basically
an interpretation

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:57.450 align:middle line:10%
of Greek, Egyptian,
psychological, and spiritual

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:10%
wisdom.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.290 align:middle line:10%
It's one of my favorite
books of all time.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:84%
One summer, I read it
five times in a row

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and determined to make
this documentary about it.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Neil Kramer, on Gaia's
"Open Minds," talked exactly

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.850 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NEIL KRAMER: The polarization
principle in hermetism is

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.730 align:middle line:10%
nicely and simply discussed in
this little book called "The

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:10%
Kybalion," which was--

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.830 align:middle line:10%
the origin of it is
mysterious, but we

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:10%
think it was William Walker
Atkinson and Paul Foster

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.980 align:middle line:10%
Case got together and
thought about this

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.530 align:middle line:10%
and put this little book
of principles together.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
principles is polarity,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:84%
which is to say the world uses
this great positive negative

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.610 align:middle line:84%
force of the solar
masculine creator

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:47.150 align:middle line:90%
and the lunar female destroyer.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And those two forces pull at
both ends of the spectrum,

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:52.580 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And everything falls
into polarization

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:59.390 align:middle line:84%
in that respect, love, hate,
courage, despair, whatever.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And the principle of it
is that polarization,

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.440 align:middle line:84%
you have to map the negative and
know it in your heart and will

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.490 align:middle line:90%
and mind.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:10.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to map the positive
in a similar fashion

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.130 align:middle line:84%
to find the center point,
to find equilibrium.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you discover
this great secret

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:84%
that there's no such
thing as hot or cold--

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.900 align:middle line:84%
classic example--
there is temperature.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as love and hate.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:90%
There is feeling.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot love
unless you hate it deeply.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.080 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
feel deeply, you've

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.850 align:middle line:90%
got to be prepared for venom.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:35.330 align:middle line:84%
If you want to love completely
and unconditionally, you

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:41.360 align:middle line:84%
need total separation, total
almost despondent isolation.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Total anarchy within oneself.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to feel, there
is no limit to those boundaries,

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.165 align:middle line:90%
the positive and the negative.

00:37:49.165 --> 00:37:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
path of the human.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
violent in a manner that

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.860 align:middle line:84%
is going to go against
somebody's informed consent.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be ugly.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.500 align:middle line:84%
It can be a path, a shadow
mapping of great beauty,

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:84%
like, say, HR Giger, the
artist, or Stockhausen,

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.960 align:middle line:84%
with his incredible, bizarre
music in the '50s and '60s

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:17.210 align:middle line:84%
or my favorite Swedish
death metal bands.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:19.730 align:middle line:84%
They're not just guys
playing the guitars

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of distortion.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.980 align:middle line:84%
They're mapping shadow,
just like Byron and Shelley,

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and Tennyson mapped
shadow in poetry.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So these musicians map
what is the shadow.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Why does it pull us?

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.770 align:middle line:90%
How can we talk about it?

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can't
always put words to it,

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.930 align:middle line:84%
so we use a
paintbrush or a guitar

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:47.090 align:middle line:84%
or food or sex, strange,
subversive, crazy sex,

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to go to the hillside
under the full moon

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and to give this ritual
emancipation, this ritual

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.170 align:middle line:84%
liberation of self
through the sexual energy,

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:00.330 align:middle line:84%
a sort of European
Kundalini type thing.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So there can be positive
shadow mappings.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there are
many light shadow mappings

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:84%
in finding serenity,
peace, wholeness,

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
fruitfulness in one's life
to become a good householder,

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:84%
to become a man of integrity,
to become a woman of substance,

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.150 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Those things show you that
this whole path is one thing.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:90%
There is no separate stuff.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It's all poles.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.732 align:middle line:90%
Everything is dual.

00:39:25.732 --> 00:39:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Neil seemed to
cover a lot of ground, Mitch,

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.930 align:middle line:84%
in that one little
segment, didn't he?

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.030 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's a
perfect encapsulation

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:33.080 align:middle line:10%
of "The Kybalion."

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.820 align:middle line:10%
I think he put it beautifully.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:10%
The core teaching
of "The Kybalion,"

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.290 align:middle line:10%
as he was referencing, is
that life is a polarity.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:42.320 align:middle line:10%
And there was a great spiritual
teacher, GI Gurdjieff,

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:10%
who had a very
simple expression,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.550 align:middle line:10%
"every stick has two ends."

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.180 align:middle line:10%
It's a simple expression,
but it opens up onto so much.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:10%
Those are our lives.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.260 align:middle line:10%
And a person can rest assured
that if something happens

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.320 align:middle line:10%
to you that you think
is a misfortune,

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:10%
is some kind of a
crisis, look very,

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.480 align:middle line:10%
very carefully,
because you may be

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.550 align:middle line:10%
delivered by that misfortune.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.800 align:middle line:84%
You may be delivered
by that crisis.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I have wished for things,
I have prayed for things,

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.163 align:middle line:84%
and I have not gotten them,
and I look back later--

00:40:12.163 --> 00:40:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
question yourself?

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I have
often found that when

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get something, it was
the greatest thing that could

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.430 align:middle line:90%
possibly have happened to me.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.950 align:middle line:10%
That if I had gotten
the very thing I wanted,

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.350 align:middle line:10%
it might have closed me off
to another relationship,

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.760 align:middle line:10%
to another opportunity.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:10%
Life is very mysterious, and we
move along this sliding scale.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.160 align:middle line:10%
And we can never be certain
what represents deliverance,

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.050 align:middle line:10%
what represents destruction.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:39.170 align:middle line:10%
Don't wish too hard
for things to be easy.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.540 align:middle line:10%
Because I think we get
refined by friction,

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.683 align:middle line:10%
and that's part of
this polarity of life.

00:40:43.683 --> 00:40:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, remember
that saying too,

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.827 align:middle line:90%
be careful what you wish for.

00:40:46.827 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, yes.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could come
back and haunt you.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.890 align:middle line:10%
And I think we get a
lot of what we wish for,

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:10%
and we're not aware of it.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:10%
And I think we're
very forgetful.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:10%
I think there are
these time intervals,

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.670 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes
things that we might

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:10%
have wanted when we were very
young come to us later in life,

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:04.190 align:middle line:10%
and we regard them
as misfortunes.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.290 align:middle line:10%
But if we peel back the
layers of the onion,

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:10.093 align:middle line:10%
we might find a correlation
between thought and event.

00:41:10.093 --> 00:41:11.260 align:middle line:10%
It's something to watch for.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Mitch, where
does karma fit into this?

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.110 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, I personally
think in terms of reciprocity

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.060 align:middle line:10%
rather than karma, per se.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:10%
Because karma is such a
large, immense process.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.460 align:middle line:10%
It's very difficult
to understand

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.270 align:middle line:10%
the cause and effect of life.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:10%
But I feel certain.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:10%
I feel certain more than
any other time in my life

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.280 align:middle line:10%
that we are all
intimately connected.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.690 align:middle line:90%
There is a human wholeness.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And it stands to reason that
violence I do to another,

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing to myself.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.670 align:middle line:84%
The law of reciprocity I think
is at the back of ethics.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.455 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the law by
which I attempt to live.

00:41:45.455 --> 00:41:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And you do this practically
every day, don't you?

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I make
every effort to.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.290 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't necessarily mean
taking a sweetheart approach

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:54.770 align:middle line:10%
to life all the time.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.400 align:middle line:10%
It just means understanding
there is an intimate connection

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.360 align:middle line:10%
among us, and the way I
treat another is ultimately

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.290 align:middle line:10%
the way I treat self.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've
said in the past

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:06.712 align:middle line:84%
that you might not need magic
or spellwork to live and exist.

00:42:06.712 --> 00:42:08.170 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
one of the things

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:11.920 align:middle line:10%
I wondered, maybe, maybe
in our age and generation,

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.690 align:middle line:10%
we're learning enough about the
causative qualities of thought

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:21.550 align:middle line:10%
to realize that thought
itself is a tool of creation,

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:10%
a tool of instigation,
a tool of out picturing

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:10%
whatever we're about
into the world, which

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.520 align:middle line:10%
is exactly what we're trying
to accomplish with ritual

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.450 align:middle line:10%
or ceremony or prayer.

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.750 align:middle line:10%
And if we really
believe, and if we really

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.520 align:middle line:10%
understand that
thought is a force,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.600 align:middle line:10%
it's possible that
in our generation,

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.960 align:middle line:10%
we may not need ritual
and ceremony anymore

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.310 align:middle line:10%
to externalize thought.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:47.470 align:middle line:84%
The very understanding
that thought

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.920 align:middle line:84%
is a creative force
may be enough for us

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.580 align:middle line:90%
to help navigate and use it.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back to
Manly P. Hall for a moment.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:00.190 align:middle line:84%
If he saw of things that we're
doing today as societies,

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.430 align:middle line:90%
what would he be saying?

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.805 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, I think
Manly's concern towards the end

00:43:03.805 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:10%
of his life was that
there was just a breakdown

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.100 align:middle line:10%
in human civility, basically.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:14.320 align:middle line:10%
And he foresaw this before the
internet really came of age.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.800 align:middle line:10%
I find the common
use of sarcasm,

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.280 align:middle line:10%
of rhetorical questions,
of diminishing comments

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.600 align:middle line:10%
about other people, to be
an absolute poisonous smog.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.480 align:middle line:10%
It's the most destructive
element of human nature.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.670 align:middle line:10%
Sarcasm has its purpose.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:33.070 align:middle line:10%
Rhetorical questions
have their purpose.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.950 align:middle line:10%
But we can't make these things
into the common language

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:39.250 align:middle line:10%
of everyday life, which
is what's happened online.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to
get away from gossip,

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.995 align:middle line:90%
hateful comments, sarcasm.

00:43:43.995 --> 00:43:45.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The haters
are everywhere.

00:43:45.453 --> 00:43:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Haters
are everywhere.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:47.680 align:middle line:90%
I challenge people.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.630 align:middle line:90%
I challenge people.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Avoid that stuff for
one hour-- one hour--

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and see if you don't
stand more fully tall.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.820 align:middle line:10%
Because the diminishment that
you bring to another person's

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.480 align:middle line:10%
life, you are internalizing in
ways that you don't suspect.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let
me ask you this.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:84%
When you are practicing
this on a regular basis,

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.720 align:middle line:90%
do you physically feel better?

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.230 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I physically
feel better when I absolutely

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.830 align:middle line:10%
desist from doing something
that humiliates or diminishes

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.030 align:middle line:10%
another person.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:24.500 align:middle line:10%
And I am not saying that I take
a milquetoast approach to life.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.610 align:middle line:10%
I can get very
tough with people,

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.900 align:middle line:10%
and I can criticize
people's careers and actions

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:35.400 align:middle line:10%
and policies and do so with
a great deal of vitality

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.200 align:middle line:10%
and energy.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:41.480 align:middle line:10%
But I will not attack, diminish,
demean, or humiliate the person

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.230 align:middle line:10%
as a person.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.980 align:middle line:10%
And if you can avoid
this withering sarcasm,

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.530 align:middle line:10%
if you can avoid making
insulting or diminishing

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.470 align:middle line:10%
comments about another
person, you will stand taller,

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.410 align:middle line:10%
and you will feel the
effects right away.

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.702 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're not talking
about joking and kidding

00:44:55.702 --> 00:44:56.502 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:44:56.502 --> 00:44:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Of
course, of course.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:04.130 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to walk around
eliminating sarcasm or irony

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:06.230 align:middle line:10%
from our lives,
just don't make it

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:09.380 align:middle line:10%
into the vocabulary
of hour-by-hour life.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch, how do
people get a hold of you,

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.160 align:middle line:90%
your website, your books.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.330 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.163 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: My website
is MitchHorowitz.com.

00:45:16.163 --> 00:45:18.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm on Twitter, @MitchHorowitz.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.110 align:middle line:10%
Instagram, @MitchHorowitz23.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.030 align:middle line:10%
And people can find
all my latest books

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:24.922 align:middle line:10%
on Amazon or any place
they buy their books.

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:26.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on the program.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Pleasure
as always, George.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:30.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always great
talking to Mitch Horowitz.

00:45:30.338 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:90%
He's so upbeat.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.690 align:middle line:10%
When you deal with
the occult, you

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.810 align:middle line:10%
don't know what you're going to
get, but with Mitch Horowitz,

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:37.730 align:middle line:10%
you know you're going to be OK.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
