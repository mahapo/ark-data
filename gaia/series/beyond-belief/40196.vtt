welcome to Beyond Belief.

I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:30.564 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wondered what
it's like to communicate

does all the time.

>> Mary Ann Winkowski:
[Background Music] I found

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.776 align:middle line:84%
out that I have special gift
when I was seven years old.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:46.379 align:middle line:84%
But it sort of backwards
because when I was seven,

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.382 align:middle line:84%
I found out nobody else
could do what I do.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.218 align:middle line:90%
I thought everybody could do it.

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:53.854 align:middle line:84%
When I was two years old,
my grandmother realized

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:57.057 align:middle line:84%
that I could see and talk
to earthbound spirits.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.594 align:middle line:84%
What she didn't realize is
that all children can talk

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:03.396 align:middle line:84%
to earthbound spirits
plus ones that crossed

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.899 align:middle line:90%
over and guardian angels.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.868 align:middle line:84%
So, she started taking
me around to funerals

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:10.103 align:middle line:90%
when I was four years old.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've just been
doing that ever since.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.177 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in town, I still go
to 10 or 12 funerals a month.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:20.113 align:middle line:84%
People invite me to
their funeral to talk

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:23.049 align:middle line:84%
to their loved one
for the last time.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.653 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel different
from anybody else only

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:30.223 align:middle line:90%
because this is normal for me.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:33.894 align:middle line:84%
When I go out, I do
see spirits everywhere.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
The really good thing is they
don't know I can see them unless

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.331 align:middle line:90%

Two years old you saw
spirits and ghosts?

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah.

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:90%
But, all the kids can do that.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.178 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the imaginary friends--

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I couldn't
do it when I was two.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.216 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Oh, I bet
you don't remember--

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I don't think.

00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:58.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I bet you had
a really great imagination,

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.187 align:middle line:84%
that's what your mom
would have called it.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Was it
genetic for you?

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:03.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Grammy
had the ability,

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
but not as good as
I could do it.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.329 align:middle line:84%
She realized I could
do it better than her

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.731 align:middle line:84%
and that's what she started
taking into the funerals.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And Mary Ann,
now you go to funerals--

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:15.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: A lot--

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- on a regular basis?

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, I do.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:21.241 align:middle line:84%
It's really strange
because I used

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.976 align:middle line:84%
to go anytime anybody
invited me.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.078 align:middle line:90%
But now, I had to make rules.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:29.015 align:middle line:84%
And the rule is you have to
be an immediate family member.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.985 align:middle line:84%
You can't believe how
nosy some neighbors are.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.955 align:middle line:84%
So, it has to be an immediate
family member and, you know,

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and if it's a quick
death, it's pretty good

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.393 align:middle line:84%
because where do you want to
be buried, and what do you want

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to wear and where's the
life insurance policies.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.733 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always where's the
key to the safety deposit box.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are they
aware that they're dead?

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:49.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes.

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:50.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They are.

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:52.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: How do you not
stand at the foot of your casket

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.241 align:middle line:84%
and looked in the casket
and see your body there.

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they
know it's them.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Of
course, they do.

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:57.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Are they upset?

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: You know what,

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:02.415 align:middle line:84%
I think it is everybody's
choice to die when they die.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:04.618 align:middle line:84%
I think you know that
before you come back.

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:07.887 align:middle line:84%
You can't remember how could you
live your whole life thinking,

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:10.223 align:middle line:84%
"Oh gosh, when I'm 42, I'm
going to get hit by a bus."

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.858 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't live.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.494 align:middle line:84%
I don't think all of them are
real happy with their choices

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:90%
if they're dead at that point.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.999 align:middle line:90%
But they do accept it.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Have you figured

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.504 align:middle line:84%
out what you believe
the other side might be?

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:28.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I know that when
they are standing at the foot

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:33.213 align:middle line:84%
of their casket, they can see
loved ones that have crossed

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:38.151 align:middle line:84%
on before them that are
going, "Come on, come on."

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.619 align:middle line:90%
They can't talk to them.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.788 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's an
incentive to make

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.758 align:middle line:90%
that person walk into the light.

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:46.226 align:middle line:90%
But, you have freewill.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.328 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to go,
you don't have to go.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You're a ghost buster.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.364 align:middle line:90%
That means you send them on.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I do.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:55.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are there times
you wish that they stayed?

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:56.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Oh no, never.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:57.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You're always
glad they moved on.

00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:59.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:01.941 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if I could find one
that did windows and iron but--

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:02.776 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Good luck.

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, right.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Good luck.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:05.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: No.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:08.181 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How do you get
them to go to the other side?

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:09.949 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Believe it or not,

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.252 align:middle line:84%
the older I've gotten,
the easier it is.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.622 align:middle line:84%
When I was 14 or 15 or
16 years old talking

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.891 align:middle line:84%
to a 45-year-old
male ghost and going,

00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:20.259 align:middle line:84%
"I'm going to make the
right white light for you

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.528 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to go into it."

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:22.696 align:middle line:90%
It's like, "Yeah right, girlie."

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:23.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They don't
listen to you?

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:25.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: To a 14-year-old?

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:26.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:29.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: You know,
but as I've gotten older,

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.938 align:middle line:84%
plus the fact is that
once I clear a house,

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.308 align:middle line:84%
I protect the house so that
it can never happen again.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:40.413 align:middle line:84%
And if they choose not to leave,
then the protection is going

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:44.751 align:middle line:84%
to go up and they can't
ever get out of the house.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:48.421 align:middle line:84%
So, their choice is go
to the light or leave.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is a ghost who hangs
around the house a poltergeist

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:53.526 align:middle line:90%
or is that something else?

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Poltergeist,
ghost, spirit,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.798 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a bunch
of different names

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.968 align:middle line:90%
for the same earthbound spirit.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Are they evil or not?

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: They have the
same personality they had

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:07.874 align:middle line:90%
when they were alive.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:10.009 align:middle line:84%
If they were a nice widow
lady when they're alive,

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.445 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be a nice widow
lady ghost in somebody's house.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:13.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: If they were a
pervert when they were alive,

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:16.616 align:middle line:84%
they were going to be a
pervert when they're dead.

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:20.587 align:middle line:84%
And oh gosh, and I'm invisible
and I could really... voyeur.

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:21.554 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Do what they do.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:22.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: That's
right, right.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.091 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What about
haunting, Mary Ann?

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I think that--
and it's odd, I think relatives

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.067 align:middle line:84%
that have issues when they die,
a mother that hasn't talked

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:37.837 align:middle line:84%
to her daughter for 15 years
or that kind of a thing,

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:42.308 align:middle line:84%
that's where I see more of
a family getting involved.

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:46.479 align:middle line:84%
You know, "Well, I'll fix her
now that I'm dead," and that's--

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.616 align:middle line:84%
and I would consider
that more a haunting.

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.885 align:middle line:84%
Ninety percent of
the house is I do,

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:53.953 align:middle line:90%
the ghost is a total stranger.

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:57.991 align:middle line:84%
Your own relative in most
instances wouldn't do

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:01.027 align:middle line:84%
that to you, where the
energy drink cause problems

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.395 align:middle line:84%
with your electric
and everything

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:03.596 align:middle line:90%
in the house, move things.

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:05.765 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do you sense
these ghosts or Feel them?

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:06.599 align:middle line:90%
How do you--

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: See them.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You see them?

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:09.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I see them
as clear as I see you.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.772 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a wiz
or a streak of lightning

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.509 align:middle line:84%
Hair color, eye color,
the clothes they have on,

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.211 align:middle line:90%
that's how I see them.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:21.114 align:middle line:84%
And unless I try to
get their attention,

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:23.583 align:middle line:84%
they don't really
know I can see them.

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:27.387 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of times I wink
at one of them and they go.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.988 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did they
ever wink back?

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: You
know, sometimes.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Hi there.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:34.227 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: How are you doing?

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are they
always the same age

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:38.331 align:middle line:90%
as they were when they died?

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:42.368 align:middle line:84%
They do not get older
when you are earthbound.

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Once you cross over, then you
go back to an age that you look

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.542 align:middle line:84%
and felt good, which
isn't necessarily 18.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:50.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They have
the right to pick.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:51.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They pick their age.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.179 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.248 align:middle line:84%
They usually go back
to 45 to 55 years old.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Really?

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:58.551 align:middle line:90%
How about clothes style?

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:02.555 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Usually, they have
on what they were buried in.

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:05.291 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen them change
clothes and they won't tell me.

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:08.561 align:middle line:84%
I've seen smoke, tobacco,
pipes, Dillard's in the sky.

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:09.362 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:10.797 align:middle line:90%
There's some place.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:14.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What do you think
the other side is now?

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Eternal rest,
peace it has to be that.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.573 align:middle line:84%
You know, with my upbringing
and my religious background,

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:23.977 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, heaven is what
your perception of that is.

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:25.144 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:26.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: The
interesting thing--

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And hell--

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Well,
never, I was going there.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:32.585 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing is no
matter how bad that person was

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:36.055 align:middle line:84%
and I was asked to attend a
funeral of a man that was put

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:39.325 align:middle line:84%
to death by the state, he did
heinous things, horrible things.

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:40.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why would
you want to go?

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:41.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: They
asked me to come.

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:42.996 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to find out--

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Their family did?

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, because
they wanted to know if he--

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.132 align:middle line:84%
now, that he was dead
if he would tell them

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:50.069 align:middle line:84%
where the mother's body
was because they never--

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You mean, the body
of the mother he killed?

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:54.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Correct.

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:55.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Did he tell them?

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:56.876 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: He did.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What?

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:00.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: The interesting
thing is the white light would

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.514 align:middle line:90%
surround him too.

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:06.953 align:middle line:84%
So, in Mary Ann's world,
everybody goes into that light

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:09.155 align:middle line:84%
but somebody standing there
with the clipboard deciding

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.356 align:middle line:90%
which way you're going.

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:12.725 align:middle line:84%
He certainly didn't go
where Mother Theresa went.

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:16.663 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do they show
remorse on the other side?

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I see a lot of
remorse here before they go in.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:23.236 align:middle line:84%
That's reasons sometimes where
some people don't go to light

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:25.772 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid
of retribution.

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:29.208 align:middle line:84%
And of the funerals that I go
to, the interesting thing is--

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:32.011 align:middle line:84%
and not funny ha-ha,
but funny interesting,

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:36.349 align:middle line:84%
is that if the person was
an agnostic or an atheist,

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:40.420 align:middle line:84%
there he is standing at the foot
of his casket a little shocked

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.923 align:middle line:84%
that he's just not
a pile of ashes.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:45.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When you
go to a funeral,

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.794 align:middle line:90%
is there always a spirit there?

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:49.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Always.

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.563 align:middle line:84%
Always, they're always
standing at the foot

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:54.267 align:middle line:84%
of their casket listening
to everything that's said.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:57.604 align:middle line:84%
They can't read minds, which in
some instance is a good thing.

00:08:57.604 --> 00:09:00.139 align:middle line:84%
But they can-- you know,
the ladies would walk

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.308 align:middle line:84%
down both sides and
check out their flowers,

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:90%
who sent flowers, who didn't.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:08.915 align:middle line:84%
And it's a guy thing-- I don't
know, counting how many cars

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:10.783 align:middle line:84%
in the funeral precession
to the cemetery.

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:12.118 align:middle line:90%
They like lots of cars.

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.486 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You had a
role in Ghost Whisperer.

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:15.989 align:middle line:90%
What did you do for them?

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:19.792 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Most of the
stories were cases that I had,

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:23.162 align:middle line:84%
you know, worked on that they
Hollywoodized [phonetic].

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, let's
take a look.

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: [Background Music]
'Cause I get a script every week

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and I sit here with the
red pen and I'd go, "No,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.571 align:middle line:90%
you don't walk through a ghost.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.139 align:middle line:90%
Ghost doesn't walk through you.

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.974 align:middle line:84%
They're not bloody,
they're not gory."

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:40.246 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Listen Mary
Ann, this is entertainment.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.616 align:middle line:84%
This is not a ghost
documentary every week."

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:47.186 align:middle line:90%
He says, "People love it."

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: People
do love that show.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.057 align:middle line:84%
Of course it's not running now
but you've had fun doing that--

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:51.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Five years--

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- with Jennifer Love.

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.729 align:middle line:84%
It was-- It's such
an experience to deal

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:58.698 align:middle line:84%
with even though I got
frustrated with them.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:01.034 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted it to be right.

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:04.137 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want it to
be Hollywoodized.

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:07.907 align:middle line:84%
But I think eventually, they--
everybody got the message.

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:08.841 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Did they listen?

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:09.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I think so.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But they still
wanted to do it their own way.

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:12.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Their own way.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.549 align:middle line:84%
And so, I gave a little
and they gave a little.

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:18.985 align:middle line:90%
And it did good.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You started
that two years old.

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:24.257 align:middle line:84%
You said every child has
this gift, this ability.

00:10:24.257 --> 00:10:25.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How good
do they get as a kid?

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Depends
on the parents.

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:32.298 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you kept
hearing when you're a child

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.533 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, you're a big boy now.

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:34.867 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is in your bedroom.

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:36.069 align:middle line:90%
Don't be ridiculous."

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:39.505 align:middle line:84%
"There's no such
thing as ghost."

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:42.508 align:middle line:84%
"You know, your foot
can dangle off the bed.

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:43.876 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is going to get it."

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:46.713 align:middle line:84%
And it's like when you were a
kid and your mother sent you

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:48.948 align:middle line:84%
down the basement to get
something, did you hum, whistle

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:52.752 align:middle line:84%
or skip all the way down,
so it wouldn't get you.

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.121 align:middle line:90%
That's-- we sense it.

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
We know there's something
going on.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:58.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And-- but if
the parent is the parent

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.195 align:middle line:90%
that will go, "Well, why?

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:03.096 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:90%
What do you think is going on?"

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.265 align:middle line:90%
At least the kid doesn't feel

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:10.536 align:middle line:84%
like they're being scolded
for talking about it.

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:12.071 align:middle line:90%
And they don't keep it inside.

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.573 align:middle line:84%
And I really think it's
one of these things

00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:15.007 align:middle line:84%
if you don't use
it, you'll lose it.

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, a lot of
parents do make that mistake.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yes,
yeah, they do.

00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:21.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Try to
criticize the kid--

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:22.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:23.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: -- and
things like that.

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And just
because you didn't see it

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.954 align:middle line:84%
or remember seeing it when you
were a child doesn't mean your

00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:29.288 align:middle line:90%
child can't do it.

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What are some of
the things that children see

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.128 align:middle line:84%
that are spirit related
because they do see some ghosts.

00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:37.096 align:middle line:84%
They see something
come out of a closet.

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: They do.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:40.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Things
like that are scary.

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: The ones
that specifically try

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:46.606 align:middle line:84%
to scare children will
come out of a closet.

00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:49.842 align:middle line:84%
Walk over to the bed
and bash against it--

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Push or
try to hurt the kid.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.746 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: -- so that it--
yeah, it shakes the kid up.

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:55.848 align:middle line:90%
And the kid starts screaming

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:59.919 align:middle line:84%
which in turns has the parents
running in, which is more energy

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:02.288 align:middle line:90%
which they need to keep going.

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:05.057 align:middle line:84%
So, if they can do anything
to stress out the kid--

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.859 align:middle line:90%
did a house here two weeks ago.

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:09.862 align:middle line:84%
Set of twin little
girls, six months old,

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:13.766 align:middle line:84%
the one twin was very aware of
stuff going on at six months,

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:16.435 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't sleep in her
crib, would sleep anywhere

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:90%
in the house except her crib.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:23.476 align:middle line:84%
She had claw marks on her
crib, on the foot of her crib.

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:25.011 align:middle line:90%
Didn't touch the other twin.

00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:26.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:27.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: But that
twin was oblivious to it.

00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:30.316 align:middle line:84%
So, kids some pick
it up, some don't.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:31.584 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Claw marks.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:90%
That sounds like something evil.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: It wasn't.

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:38.357 align:middle line:84%
But the man probably was very
close to being a pedophile

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:39.826 align:middle line:90%
when he had been alive.

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.929 align:middle line:84%
And you think about running
your hand on a chalkboard.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.097 align:middle line:84%
When you got a six-month-old
baby in a crib

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:49.735 align:middle line:84%
and you run your fingernails
down, the wooden headboard

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:53.306 align:middle line:84%
of a crib, that's going to be
a screechy noise to an infant.

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:55.708 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he was doing.

00:12:55.708 --> 00:13:01.013 align:middle line:84%
They were close enough where
if the cat had been 60 pounds,

00:13:01.013 --> 00:13:02.582 align:middle line:84%
maybe the cat could
have scratched it

00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:04.317 align:middle line:90%
but no cats can do that.

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:06.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, you know,
we've talked about children

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:08.087 align:middle line:90%
and let's look at this video.

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:10.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: There could
be signs in your house

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:11.524 align:middle line:90%
that you have something.

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:17.129 align:middle line:84%
If you have children,
listen to your kids.

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:20.967 align:middle line:84%
Kids are excellent,
excellent barometers

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.169 align:middle line:84%
if you've got a ghost
in the house.

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:26.572 align:middle line:84%
Kids can play and talk
to their guardian angel.

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:29.442 align:middle line:84%
They can play to earthbound--
with earthbound spirits,

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:31.744 align:middle line:90%
spirits that crossed over.

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:35.214 align:middle line:84%
But also, listen to your kids
if they're afraid to stay

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:37.049 align:middle line:84%
in their bedroom in the
middle of the night.

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:40.286 align:middle line:84%
Did they climb in bed with
you every time in the middle

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:41.854 align:middle line:84%
of the night at 2
o'clock in the morning?

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:44.357 align:middle line:84%
If your kids have
a lot of ear, nose,

00:13:44.357 --> 00:13:48.527 align:middle line:84%
throat and upper respiratory
problems, that could be a sign

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:51.831 align:middle line:84%
that you've got a ghost in the
house, an earthbound ghost.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:55.067 align:middle line:84%
If children jump in the bed with
you, what does that tell you?

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:56.669 align:middle line:90%
They're petrified of this ghost.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: They're
afraid of their bedroom.

00:13:58.437 --> 00:13:59.639 align:middle line:90%
They are afraid.

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:01.841 align:middle line:84%
And no kids should be
afraid in their own house.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.076 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does your six-year-old
had to take his sister

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:05.878 align:middle line:84%
with him every time he goes
to the bathroom or goes

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:09.982 align:middle line:84%
down the basement or they drag
the dog with them or the cat.

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:90%
What is he afraid of?

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.086 align:middle line:84%
He should not be
afraid in his own house.

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:16.355 align:middle line:90%
There's something going on.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:22.795 align:middle line:84%
And if your children have an
earthbound spirit that's a

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:26.032 align:middle line:90%
bully, another kid, all

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:29.435 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden your perfectly
normal seven-year-old starts

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:32.705 align:middle line:84%
taking a napkin and
throwing it on the gas stoves

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.441 align:middle line:84%
and setting fire to
it or start to play

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:36.876 align:middle line:90%
with scissors, you know--

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
not a good friend.

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:41.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: No, somebody-- you
know, kids listen to other kids.

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:45.251 align:middle line:84%
If the kids doesn't,
you know, 360 like that,

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.919 align:middle line:90%
some thing is going on.

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:50.756 align:middle line:84%
A lady had called in, I told her
better do something about it.

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:53.426 align:middle line:84%
She goes-- I said, you
know, "Get the priest in,

00:14:53.426 --> 00:14:56.762 align:middle line:84%
have the house blessed, use
a smudge stick, do something.

00:14:56.762 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Don't do nothing because the
kid is messing with your child."

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later she
calls, she says "Billy--

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.505 align:middle line:84%
" who was the ghost, that
was the name the little boy

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:90%
had given.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.008 align:middle line:84%
Her son had given
him the name Billy.

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:12.678 align:middle line:84%
"Billy made me do it," threw
5 pounds of sugar in the dryer

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:14.947 align:middle line:90%
and turned the dryer on.

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:16.983 align:middle line:84%
The dryer couldn't
even be saved.

00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:18.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No.

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:19.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: They're lucky
the house didn't burn out.

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: My little
granddaughter has a ghostly

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.223 align:middle line:84%
friend called Shabuzi
[assumed spelling].

00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:28.594 align:middle line:84%
We don't know who Shabuzi
ism but when she was a kid,

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:29.662 align:middle line:90%
they were close friends.

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:31.464 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't bring
her up anymore.

00:15:31.464 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:90%
The girl is 13 now.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.202 align:middle line:90%
But she would make my daughter,

00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:39.171 align:middle line:84%
her mother put an extra
plate at the able.

00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:39.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:41.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And then,

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.541 align:middle line:84%
when Christie [assumed
spelling] my daughter sat down,

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:46.479 align:middle line:84%
the little one screamed "Oh,
you're sitting on Shabuzi."

00:15:46.479 --> 00:15:47.513 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Exactly right.

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Where do
they get that name?

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: It's what--

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:53.386 align:middle line:84%
how they hear the
ghost talk to them.

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:54.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I mean, did
the ghost tell them?

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:56.022 align:middle line:90%
My name is Shabuzi.

00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:57.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:58.824 align:middle line:84%
It must have been a
fun name for the kid.

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:00.993 align:middle line:90%
And the weird thing is this.

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.996 align:middle line:84%
People always say, "Well,
when they were kids,

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:05.631 align:middle line:84%
they had all these
imaginary friends.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.466 align:middle line:90%
I don't what happened to them."

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.602 align:middle line:84%
An earthbound spirit
doesn't age.

00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:11.771 align:middle line:90%
Your child does everyday.

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:14.440 align:middle line:90%
When your kids get too old,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.109 align:middle line:84%
the younger ghost kids
will just move to a house

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.644 align:middle line:84%
where there're little
kids again.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.579 align:middle line:90%
That's where they disappear too.

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:21.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What about animals?

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:22.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Animals stay--

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:23.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- ghostly.

00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:25.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Absolutely,
animals can stay too.

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:30.189 align:middle line:84%
And the white light is
actually there for them too.

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:35.327 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of animals
out in the country and wild

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:38.564 align:middle line:84%
that are not domesticated
that I have seen.

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
domesticated animals

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.936 align:middle line:84%
that stick around,
cats and dogs.

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:47.739 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have a hard time
getting a dog to cross over,

00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:84%
sits, stays, make the light,
throw a stone or something

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.746 align:middle line:84%
and the dog will
jump right into it.

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:57.116 align:middle line:84%
A cat, you know, cats,
they have their own mind.

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They like to stay.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:00.853 align:middle line:84%
And I have to hope that there's
a spirit of a person there

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.655 align:middle line:84%
that scoop the cat up
and take the cat up.

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:04.856 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: A lot of people will
talk about their dead animals

00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:06.459 align:middle line:90%
and see pawprints on the bed.

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:08.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yes,
they can feel it.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.028 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Some, they
make that indentation.

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.464 align:middle line:90%
They can feel it absolutely.

00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:14.633 align:middle line:84%
And they come back and
forth and visit too.

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:19.605 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that has died
is-- if you trim of them,

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.873 align:middle line:90%
that means they've crossed over.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.007 align:middle line:90%
They are not stuck.

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:23.241 align:middle line:90%
They are not earthbound.

00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:25.878 align:middle line:84%
Earthbound spirits have
never been in dreams.

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So, if you see your
love pets in a dream,

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.549 align:middle line:84%
they're where they're
supposed to be, you will meet

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.585 align:middle line:84%
up with them again
at some point.

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle line:84%
Grandmas, grandpas, relatives,
anybody that you've see

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:38.157 align:middle line:84%
in a dream, they're where
they're supposed to be.

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:41.093 align:middle line:84%
And that's good because you
can actually talk to them just

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:43.129 align:middle line:84%
like we're talking,
people don't realize that.

00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:45.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I've always thought
dying was like dreaming.

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.433 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I think
it is to a point.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:50.269 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
good way to put it.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
People that have and had
had any kind of surgery

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.942 align:middle line:84%
where they are knocked
out for the surgery,

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that's almost
the same thing.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.112 align:middle line:84%
One minute, you're
awake, the next minute,

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:02.148 align:middle line:84%
they're waking you
up in recovery.

00:18:02.148 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:90%
That has to be like dying.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.851 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:06.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And Mary Ann,
tell me a little bit

00:18:06.952 --> 00:18:09.922 align:middle line:84%
about the near death
experiences in people.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:10.856 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:11.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Most
of those people

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:14.994 align:middle line:84%
when they have a near
death experience go

00:18:14.994 --> 00:18:16.428 align:middle line:90%
into that white light.

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:20.599 align:middle line:84%
They see people in there
that have died before them.

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And apparently, it's

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.104 align:middle line:84%
such a wonderful all
encompassing feeling.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.705 align:middle line:90%
They don't even want to leave.

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
But if it's not their
time, they're going

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.243 align:middle line:84%
to be pulled right
back into their body.

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:35.314 align:middle line:84%
But-- and total strangers
have the same story.

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:37.583 align:middle line:90%
So, it-- around the world.

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.685 align:middle line:90%
So, it can't be just one person.

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:43.722 align:middle line:84%
It happens over and
over and over again.

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:45.958 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The people
who have passed on.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: At what
point do they realize,

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.466 align:middle line:90%
I'm dead, it's over for me?

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:55.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Pretty
much as soon

00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:57.436 align:middle line:90%
as they take their last breath.

00:18:57.436 --> 00:19:00.406 align:middle line:84%
When they come out of their
body and they see their--

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:02.241 align:middle line:84%
you know, see their
body right there,

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:04.276 align:middle line:84%
they pretty much know
that they're dead.

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Are they in shock?

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:08.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I think
sometimes they are.

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:11.383 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know-- a lot
of times, it's like "Oh, no.

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.985 align:middle line:84%
You know, boy that
was a stupid thing.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Why was I drinking and driving?"

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.156 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, and sometimes
they know it was just their

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.524 align:middle line:90%
own fault.

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:84%
People that have long
lingering illnesses though,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.194 align:middle line:90%
they're so relieved.

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:90%
They feel they're out of pain.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.432 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Do they want closure?

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Some of them do.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.769 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some of
them don't cross over.

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:33.439 align:middle line:84%
But-- and that's why I
think I get invited to some

00:19:33.439 --> 00:19:36.442 align:middle line:84%
of the funerals because if
you can't talk to that person

00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:38.577 align:middle line:84%
for the last time, I think
it does give you closure.

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Mary Ann, where do
demons come in and possessions.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I-- you
know, heaven and hell --

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:46.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Is it part of the sin?

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:47.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: -- yin and yang.

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:48.921 align:middle line:90%
I believe it is.

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.657 align:middle line:90%
I don't think a demon was ever

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:55.127 align:middle line:84%
from the light to
begin with though.

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:57.796 align:middle line:84%
You can be a really,
really bad person

00:19:57.796 --> 00:20:01.467 align:middle line:84%
and do heinous things
and not be the devil.

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:02.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: True.

00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:03.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: OK.

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:07.006 align:middle line:84%
The devil like angels I think
are entities into their own.

00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:09.475 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that you--

00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:13.045 align:middle line:84%
in all the years I've been doing
this now, over 60 years George,

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:16.181 align:middle line:84%
I think I've run across
three times that maybe,

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:17.783 align:middle line:90%
maybe they were never from the--

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:19.351 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, remember
the old saying though,

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:90%
"The devil made me do it."

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, well, it's
a good excuse for anybody, huh?

00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:23.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It is.

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:24.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:25.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Not real?

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:26.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I don't think so.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But you think
the devil is real?

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I do.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And I think a lot
of times, he probably just takes

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.798 align:middle line:84%
out a human form and
is walking among us.

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:35.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What has been for
you the scariest moment?

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:36.602 align:middle line:90%
Doing what you do.

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.671 align:middle line:84%
Because I would think
you open yourself

00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:90%
up to all kinds of things.

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:46.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I really couldn't
do this if it's scared me

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:49.181 align:middle line:84%
because I would be giving
that spirit more energy.

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:50.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You've
never been scared?

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:54.353 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I've been
angry at something.

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:56.722 align:middle line:84%
I've been-- the weirdest
thing just happened.

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:59.391 align:middle line:84%
Again, this has been
a very strange year.

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:03.362 align:middle line:84%
A man had called me and he says,
"I think my mother is still here

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:04.763 align:middle line:90%
and I think she's mad

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.298 align:middle line:84%
at me 'cause I didn't give her
the kind of funeral she wanted."

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:10.969 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually a reason
for some people to stay.

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:12.805 align:middle line:84%
And there was woman
standing behind him.

00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.908 align:middle line:84%
And she had really
puffy cheeks and I say,

00:21:15.908 --> 00:21:17.743 align:middle line:84%
"Does your mother
have a full face?"

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.445 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Yes."

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And I say, "I think
your mom is there."

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.616 align:middle line:84%
So he asked me to
come out and I go out.

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:28.854 align:middle line:84%
And the man had a little
bit of a speech impediment.

00:21:28.854 --> 00:21:32.725 align:middle line:84%
He-- definitely-- it was
almost somebody that stuttered

00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:35.227 align:middle line:84%
and he was trying to
say two and stop--

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:35.861 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:36.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: OK.

00:21:36.829 --> 00:21:37.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Like maybe
he had a stroke.

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:38.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Could be.

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:39.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:40.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And so the
mother was standing there

00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:42.735 align:middle line:84%
and because I don't
have to talk out loud.

00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:43.836 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yes."

00:21:43.836 --> 00:21:46.238 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You know,
your mommy is here."

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:48.607 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at me and
she goes, "I'm here."

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:51.143 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her and says,
"Yeah, I know I see you."

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm talking to the son
and she goes, "I'm here."

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at the son
and she says, "I'm here."

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.854 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I know you're here."

00:22:01.854 --> 00:22:05.958 align:middle line:84%
She goes, "I'm upstairs,
I'm here."

00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:08.093 align:middle line:90%
He never buried his mother.

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:09.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What?

00:22:09.128 --> 00:22:10.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: The
mother was upstairs.

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
She has been dead
for six months.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: This is like psycho.

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:14.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Norman?

00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:14.933 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:16.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Norman Bates.

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: That's
right and I never--

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:18.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What did you do?

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:21.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Never has
happened to me before.

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:22.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did you call
the authorities, I mean--

00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:23.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Well yeah.

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What did you do?

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.878 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: She said to
me what are you going to do?

00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:28.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is it illegal
not to bury a dead person?

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:29.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I think
in any state.

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:30.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It is.

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I think so.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Criminal or civil?

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:35.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Something
defaming a body or something.

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:36.722 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they're--

00:22:36.722 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I think the
body's already defamed.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah,
but I think that's--

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:40.626 align:middle line:84%
just don't play with
the dead body.

00:22:40.626 --> 00:22:42.227 align:middle line:90%
So but--

00:22:42.227 --> 00:22:43.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I have
to check into that.

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:44.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah,
I don't know.

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:45.597 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:48.934 align:middle line:84%
I know there is rules
about burying them.

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't
bury in your backyard.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No you can't.

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:54.206 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: No, so I don't
think you can leave them laying

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:56.708 align:middle line:90%
on the bed up tairs either.

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:57.309 align:middle line:90%
Anyway--

00:22:57.309 --> 00:22:58.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Gees.

00:22:58.143 --> 00:22:59.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: So I said, "OK."

00:22:59.278 --> 00:23:01.246 align:middle line:84%
I promised the mother I
say, "I'll do something.

00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:03.215 align:middle line:84%
I'll make sure your
body is out of here."

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:06.485 align:middle line:84%
So said to him, "OK, I'm
going to make the light,

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:07.419 align:middle line:90%
she's going to go it."

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:08.854 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
get out of there.

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:09.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well you have--

00:23:09.922 --> 00:23:11.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And my
husband was with me.

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:12.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did you tell somebody
there was a dead body upstairs?

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:13.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Well,
of course I did.

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:17.362 align:middle line:84%
After we got out of the house,
I pulled into a parking lot

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:22.167 align:middle line:84%
and I called the local
police and luckily, he said,

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
"I who you are, you're
from the television show,

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.071 align:middle line:90%
Ghost Whisperer."

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:27.973 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Yeah, great,
there's a dead body.

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Now go get the body.

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:30.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:33.178 align:middle line:84%
So they did and the police
department called me a few days

00:23:33.178 --> 00:23:35.147 align:middle line:84%
later and they had
him-- they were--

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:38.283 align:middle line:84%
had him in a psych
ward testing him.

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Right. But mom was in
garbage bags and duct tape

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.988 align:middle line:90%
up on the bed upstairs.

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:44.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now, he
didn't kill her, did he?

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: No, no.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: OK.

00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:46.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: She died
of natural causes,

00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:90%
but he's still never buried her.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.096 align:middle line:84%
Never even and apparently,
there were sort of recluses

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:52.498 align:middle line:84%
in the neighborhood,
really never noticed.

00:23:52.498 --> 00:23:54.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know, I bet this
happens everywhere, everywhere.

00:23:54.967 --> 00:23:56.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: This is
was the first for me.

00:23:56.335 --> 00:23:57.669 align:middle line:90%
Never, I was surprised.

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:59.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And never again.

00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:01.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I hope not.

00:24:01.807 --> 00:24:03.475 align:middle line:90%
I hope not.

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:05.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How long
was the person dead?

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:06.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: About six months.

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:07.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Six months.

00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yes, so
she was pretty mushy

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.414 align:middle line:90%
when they took her out.

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:10.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: She was.

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:12.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I mean,
the mother looked fine.

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.219 align:middle line:84%
You know, 'cause of course,
it's the body that's mangled

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:84%
or gorier that the spirit--
her spirit looked fine, but.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So was she
relieved once you've told?

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:21.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes, yeah.

00:24:21.727 --> 00:24:22.561 align:middle line:84%
I said and I looked
at her I said,

00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:23.195 align:middle line:90%
"I'm going to tell the police."

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:24.196 align:middle line:90%
She said, "Good."

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:25.097 align:middle line:90%
I said, "OK."

00:24:25.097 --> 00:24:25.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Did she move on?

00:24:25.998 --> 00:24:27.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I did.

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:28.467 align:middle line:84%
I made the light and
she went right into it.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:30.169 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that she was finally
going to have her body at rest.

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:32.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Have you ever had a
difficult time having somebody

00:24:32.905 --> 00:24:33.839 align:middle line:90%
to leave?

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:35.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I have.

00:24:35.073 --> 00:24:37.976 align:middle line:84%
I have. The one told me,
he said he was going to go.

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:40.846 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that actually
flipped an ax at me.

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:43.649 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't do this if I
thought I could get hurt.

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Telekinesis,
a real ax.

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes, a real ax.

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.587 align:middle line:84%
And it went pss,
pss, pss, pss, pss.

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:49.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Missed
you by how much?

00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:51.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: It was all
this close to my face.

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:52.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Wow.

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:54.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: But it was
going in this direction.

00:24:54.026 --> 00:24:56.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why was he
so upset with you?

00:24:56.128 --> 00:24:57.396 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: He
was one of the three

00:24:57.396 --> 00:25:00.499 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think has
ever gone to the light.

00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:01.567 align:middle line:90%
That was one of them.

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:03.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He was bad
in this human life.

00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:04.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right, right,

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:08.073 align:middle line:84%
and so he did terrible
things in this house.

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:11.376 align:middle line:84%
And he promised me he
would go to the light.

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So I made the light-- there
were two others beside him

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.284 align:middle line:84%
and I watched the two walk in to
the light and he started walking

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:23.355 align:middle line:84%
to the light and before he
got to it, he just veered off

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:26.558 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't ran
into him again.

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:31.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Have you ever had
a case where the entity said,

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:36.668 align:middle line:84%
"Mary Ann, the money is in
the mattress, it's here."

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:39.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Oh yeah, I found a
lot of stuff for a lot of people

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:41.073 align:middle line:90%
like that, absolutely.

00:25:41.073 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there was one
that was pretty cool.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.548 align:middle line:84%
She wanted me to come and
it was-- family fighting,

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:52.184 align:middle line:84%
family feuding, that side and
this side and what have you.

00:25:52.184 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so he wanted
me to come to the house.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.023 align:middle line:84%
The ghost did, and they
invited me to come over after.

00:25:58.023 --> 00:26:05.497 align:middle line:84%
And here they had the big pipes
for furnaces down the basement.

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:09.568 align:middle line:84%
The ghost said, "Tell
my granddaughter

00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:15.641 align:middle line:84%
that on the pipe that's marked
with the black like magic marker

00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:19.277 align:middle line:90%
and has two at the end."

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:23.749 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Tell her to
take those two apart,"

00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:27.486 align:middle line:84%
and out fell a folder
with probably

00:26:27.486 --> 00:26:29.154 align:middle line:90%
about 6,000 dollars in cash.

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: How about that?

00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:31.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah,
that was good.

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:31.957 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:32.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: She was happy.

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:33.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: She was happy.

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:34.393 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He was happy.

00:26:34.393 --> 00:26:35.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Everybody
was happy.

00:26:35.227 --> 00:26:35.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Everybody was happy.

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:36.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:37.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I love that story.

00:26:37.896 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, there
are some good stories.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:44.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why do
you do what you do?

00:26:44.503 --> 00:26:48.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Well, I guess I've
always done it and I was raised

00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:52.177 align:middle line:84%
with good work ethics and
you just keep on doing it.

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:53.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You're helping people.

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And I'm
helping people and I meet lots

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.382 align:middle line:90%
of really neat people.

00:26:57.382 --> 00:27:03.889 align:middle line:84%
And because of Ghost Whisperer,
I met a lot of famous people.

00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:07.592 align:middle line:84%
Which I-- from Cleveland, I
obviously wouldn't have bet.

00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:14.099 align:middle line:84%
So it's fun and I keep
thinking I'm going to slow down,

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:16.001 align:middle line:84%
you know, and every
time I think then,

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.069 align:middle line:90%
the phone rings off the hook.

00:27:17.069 --> 00:27:18.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You'll
never slow down.

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:19.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I know.

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What do you think
of people who sell a house

00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:23.975 align:middle line:84%
but never tell somebody
that it's haunted.

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:26.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Well, I don't
know about every state,

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:29.081 align:middle line:84%
but if there's about six days
that I know of and one is Ohio

00:27:29.081 --> 00:27:30.348 align:middle line:90%
that are on your disclosure.

00:27:30.348 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You must put it down.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: It is--
is house haunted?

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:37.155 align:middle line:84%
Has it ever been and
what did you do about it?

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:41.626 align:middle line:84%
I have a bunch of real estate
companies that I work for.

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:44.129 align:middle line:84%
If they have an open house
and somebody is walking

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:45.964 align:middle line:84%
in the front door
for their open house

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and running off the back
door, there's good reason.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.902 align:middle line:90%
But there are people right now

00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:53.705 align:middle line:84%
that will not even buy
a house that's for sale

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:56.742 align:middle line:84%
if they don't walk in and
run their hands over the top

00:27:56.742 --> 00:27:59.745 align:middle line:84%
of the door to see
if the queen seed is

00:27:59.745 --> 00:28:00.946 align:middle line:90%
up there so that they know--

00:28:00.946 --> 00:28:02.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Really?

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:02.848 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: 'Cause if
the queen seed is there,

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:03.982 align:middle line:90%
then the house is clear.

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:05.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, I'm not
sure I would buy a house

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:07.052 align:middle line:84%
if somebody died in
it if I knew about it.

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:08.487 align:middle line:90%
You would, you wouldn't care.

00:28:08.487 --> 00:28:10.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Well,
this is the thing.

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:13.358 align:middle line:84%
If it was natural causes, that
does not have to be disclosed.

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:15.961 align:middle line:84%
It only has to be disclosed
if it was a violent death.

00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:16.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:18.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:28:18.263 --> 00:28:21.833 align:middle line:84%
And that has happened where
once the carpet was picked up,

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:24.169 align:middle line:84%
their blood all under
the carpet.

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:27.739 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And I had actually
been asked by the attorney

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:30.308 align:middle line:84%
if I would go to court because
their people were trying

00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:32.444 align:middle line:90%
to get of the sale.

00:28:32.444 --> 00:28:36.014 align:middle line:84%
And I just sort of
looked at him and I said,

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:38.784 align:middle line:84%
"Are you sure you want
me to come to court?"

00:28:38.784 --> 00:28:41.286 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Why?"

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Maybe
California, New York."

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:48.193 align:middle line:84%
"Yeah?" I said, "But
in Ohio, I'm a nut."

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:50.729 align:middle line:84%
I said, "I don't think
I would be a good idea

00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.564 align:middle line:90%
if I went to court."

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.766 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You're going to
have 12 people on the jury,

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:57.869 align:middle line:84%
six are going to go, "Wow,
that's cool," and six are going

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:59.571 align:middle line:90%
to think, "She's crazy."

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.107 align:middle line:84%
I say, "I don't think it
would be a good help."

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:03.475 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Oh, OK."

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:05.343 align:middle line:90%
So I never did go to court.

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:06.578 align:middle line:90%
But they got out of it anyway.

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Mary Ann, if
people want to travel

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:11.116 align:middle line:84%
and follow you, what
will they do?

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:13.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: My website would
be the best way to do it,

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:14.653 align:middle line:90%
which is maryannwinkowski.com.

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:15.787 align:middle line:90%

you have for us here?

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:27.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: This is my latest
cook book, a hundred recipes

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:30.202 align:middle line:84%
from a hundred ghosts and a
story to go with each one.

>> Noory: "Beyond Delicious."

00:29:32.404 --> 00:29:34.406 align:middle line:84%
Of course you're not
eating the dead, are you?.

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:35.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: No.

00:29:35.473 --> 00:29:36.575 align:middle line:84%
And you don't get a
ghost in your house

00:29:36.575 --> 00:29:38.276 align:middle line:90%
by doing one of these recipes.

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:41.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You're excited
about it, I can tell.

00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:42.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I do.

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.016 align:middle line:84%
I just-- it's part
