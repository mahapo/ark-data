00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief," and we have
a very special guest for you

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:10%
today, Dr. Michael Salla.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Salla, of course,
is an investigator,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
has written a series of books,
"The Secret Space Program."

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:10%
His latest is "Antarctica's
Hidden History."

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Michael, welcome to the program.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL SALLA: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always good to see you.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You do such a
wonderful job for us

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.137 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast,"
on the radio show,

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:84%
but it's nice to be able to see
you in person once in a while.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.160 align:middle line:10%
>>SALLA: Yeah, I
think it's been--

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:10%
2003 was when we did our
first interview together,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:10%
and we've done many
over the years.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.932 align:middle line:84%
So it's really nice to do a sit
down, face-to-face interview.

00:00:59.932 --> 00:01:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Looking forward to it.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:90%
in these kinds of topics?

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, it was 2001, and
I took the proverbial red pill

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:84%
when I saw The
Disclosure Project press

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.460 align:middle line:84%
conference that was organized
by Dr. Steven Greer.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was teaching
international politics

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.300 align:middle line:84%
at the time at
American University,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and that just really impressed
me as being very credible.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And the more I researched,
the more convinced

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I was that this whole
phenomenon was real,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
cover up, that there

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of
advanced technologies

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:84%
that were being found,
and the governments just

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:90%
weren't releasing this.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing
that ever since.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you started
shifting your entire career

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:90%
into this field.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Was it an easy
transition for you?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: It wasn't,
unfortunately.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.623 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It never is, huh?

00:01:45.623 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: I was a professor
in international politics,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
specializing in international
conflict resolution,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and there were certain perks
that came with the job.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.684 align:middle line:84%
But once I got involved
in this kind of research,

00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
the university didn't want to
have anything to do with it.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually
given an ultimatum--

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: --that if I
continued this research,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that I really didn't have
a future in the university.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty
stubborn, and so I just

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:90%
continued doing the research.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
things came to a head,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and the university parted
ways in a very, I think,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:90%
an unfair way.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, that's
how it happened.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember when
you were going through that.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It was almost unbelievable
that they would not

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
accept what you were
doing as something that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:90%
would be beneficial to them.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I just still don't
get it on their part.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Right.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I was essentially being punished
because the "Washington Post"

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
decided to write a feature
story about my research

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
into President Eisenhower having
an extraterrestrial encounter

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
at Edwards Air
Force Base in 1954.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And the University
were incensed.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people that were
in the hierarchy, they were

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:84%
incensed that the
university was associated

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of research
that they thought just

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
wasn't credible and it shouldn't
be studied at a university.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And so in a sense I was
punished because "The Washington

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Post" thought that this
was worth a write up.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you have honed
in now lately on Antarctica.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what's so special
about this southern region

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.135 align:middle line:90%
of this planet?

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, Antarctica
is a place of mystery.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And the more I dig into
what's been going on,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
the more I find out that
the history of Antarctica

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
is something that tells us a lot
about ourselves, about who we

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.830 align:middle line:90%
are as a species.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.835 align:middle line:90%
And Antarctica as a continent--

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:37.925 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's vast, it's twice
the size of the 48 contiguous.

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's mysterious.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:90%
It's got it all.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: It has.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
things under the ice

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:90%
that people are familiar with.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
People know that there
are tunnel systems.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Different countries have
tunnel systems and big caves.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
But people aren't really
familiar with just how

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:84%
extensive these tunnel
systems are in many countries,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:84%
especially in Antarctica,
which really has areas

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
underneath the ice that
are very habitable,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.915 align:middle line:84%
and where there's a lot of
secrets that are buried.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they talk
about the possibility

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that there are cities
that have been covered up,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:84%
that there might
be UFOs down there,

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that there might be a Nazi
submarine base down there.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Are all of these
things possible?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Definitely, yeah.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing now is
modern science catching up,

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, because there
have been a lot of rumors,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.115 align:middle line:90%
especially since--

00:04:31.115 --> 00:04:31.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: The early
1950s when there

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of people
saying that the Nazis had

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:84%
escaped to Antarctica and
set up shop down there

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:90%
and they had their bases.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
a lot of rumors.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.356 align:middle line:84%
And people are always
very skeptical,

00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
saying, well, how
is it possible.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica is a
frozen continent--

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:90%
how could you possibly survive?

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're getting
scientific studies emerging

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
saying that, well, actually
the interior of Antarctica

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
under miles of ice is
actually very habitable.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
scientific studies now

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:90%
legitimate.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.065 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit
about the "Book of Enoch."

00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, the
"Book of Enoch"

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.800 align:middle line:84%
is a really important
book in my mind

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:84%
because it tells us about
a time in our history

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that was before the
last great flood.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
The only other book
that I think is

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
similar in terms of giving us
information about what really

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
happened in this pre-flood
area is Plato's writings

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:90%
about Atlantis.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.464 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: In the
"Book of Critias"

00:05:29.464 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:84%
he talks about the
advanced technology

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:90%
that Atlantis had achieved.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the "Book of Enoch"
you have something similar

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
occurring, where
Enoch is basically

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:84%
asked to be a mediator
in some kind of conflict

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
between these different
groups of angels,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.542 align:middle line:84%
one of the fallen angels
that are described

00:05:49.542 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:90%
in the "Book of Enoch."

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love this
stuff too because it

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
makes you wonder about
all these possibilities.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.857 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Right, and I
think the "Book of Enoch,"

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.690 align:middle line:84%
actually there were
three "Books of Enochs."

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
That's something
to keep in mind.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always thought
there was one big one.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: There's
the Ethiopian copy,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:90%
which is called "One Enoch."

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.642 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the Slavic copy,
which is called "Two Enoch."

00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:11.225 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:06:11.225 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they all different?

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: They have
different foci,

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
so they give us different
aspects on the life of Enoch.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But they are basically
describing the same phenomenon,

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:84%
that Enoch was this
person who was chosen

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:84%
to play this extraordinary
role where he would essentially

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.280 align:middle line:84%
be this mediator between
these fighting angels

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
who were fighting because
one group of angels,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.330 align:middle line:84%
the fallen angels,
had introduced

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.040 align:middle line:84%
advanced technologies to
humanity that were being abused

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and that had led to all
kinds of depredations

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.095 align:middle line:90%
and unjust policies.

00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, this
sounds ET, doesn't it?

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: And that's
exactly right.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like what we have
here in the "Book of Enoch"

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is a description of different
groups of extraterrestrials

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:90%
that are fighting.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And that Enoch was summoned by
one group of extraterrestrials

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
to essentially be
given information

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:90%
about what's really going on.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And so Enoch is summoned.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
He goes up there to
Jerusalem, to this place.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
what is Jerusalem,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
it's like, well,
this is a starship.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.384 align:middle line:90%
This is a city-sized starship.

00:07:23.384 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's amazing.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.216 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: With different
levels that they

00:07:26.216 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:90%
describe as different heavens.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
hierarchy of the angels,

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
well, these are
different entities

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
on the starship,
officers and so forth,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
like who are the seraphim,
who are the cherubim.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are officers in some
kind of a galactic federation,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.716 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The History
Channel highlighted

00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:48.224 align:middle line:90%
the "Book of Enoch."

00:07:48.224 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:10%
>> The "Book of Enoch" offers
a disturbing vision of the fall

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.005 align:middle line:10%
of the angels who lust
after earthly women.

00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Have they began to go into
them and to defile themselves

00:07:59.180 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:10%
with them.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:10%
And they taught them
charms and enchantments.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:10%
And they became pregnant,
and they bear great giants

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:10%
whose height whose 3,000 ells.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:10%
And when men could no
longer sustain them,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:10%
the giants turned against
them and devoured mankind.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:20.508 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:23.667 align:middle line:10%
>> That these angels have
crossed over this boundary that

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:10%
they shouldn't have.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:10%
They were spiritual beings and
they were to remain as such.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:10%
When they decided to
descend upon Earth,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:10%
this unleashed upon the
Earth all sorts of problems.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:10%
Not only these giants who
are bloodthirsty and violent,

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:10%
but also these angels
went on to teach humankind

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:10%
a variety of forbidden crafts.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.660 align:middle line:10%
They also taught human beings
how to make weapons of war.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Now the good angels, the ones
not tempted by these beautiful

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.850 align:middle line:10%
women, go to God and say,
there's a lot of bloodshed

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:10%
caused by these bad angels.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:10%
At which point God says,
we need to bind Azazel,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:10%
the lead fallen
angel, to bind him

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.560 align:middle line:10%
and to then cast him into a pit.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:10%
We might think of
this as how do we

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:10%
take care of nuclear
waste in the 21st century.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:10%
You take it out to a part of
the world where no one lives

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:10%
and you bury it as
deep as you can.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:10%
For this community, the angel
was like that nuclear waste--

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.902 align:middle line:10%
dangerous, volatile.

00:09:39.902 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:10%
>> After the rebel angels
are cast into the depths

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth, Enoch
has a dream vision--

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:10%
the lead angel, Azazel, begs
Enoch to plead their case

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:10%
before God, to petition the
Almighty to release them

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:10%
from the depths of the Earth.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.436 align:middle line:84%
The request for
clemency is denied.

00:10:00.436 --> 00:10:02.896 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's pretty
dramatic, Michael.

00:10:02.896 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: It is.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
biblical, too, isn't it?

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: These are
historic documents

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and I think they're very
important to understand

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
because I think they give us
a glimpse into what really

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
happened just prior to the Great
Flood, the great catastrophe.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that video, it
focused on these fallen angels

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
being banished or put
into these deep pits

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:90%
in the bowels of Earth.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we call
these fallen angels ETs?

00:10:27.895 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: I believe so.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I think that's what they were.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
they were imprisoned.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And the "Book of
Enoch" actually gives

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
an idea as to where
they were imprisoned.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.100 align:middle line:84%
They were imprisoned
in Antarctica

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
because it describes how
Enoch was being taken

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:84%
to this land in the south that
burned 24 hours, burned night

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:90%
and day for 24 hours.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:84%
That's Antarctica
during the summer.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:90%
It's daylight during the summer.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: And it
describes the area

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:84%
where the pit, where the fallen
angels were buried as being

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
a range of seven mountains.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.330 align:middle line:84%
There was this
really huge mountain

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
in the middle surrounded by
three mountains on either side,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:90%
east and west.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look at that,
it describes Mount Vinson

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and adjacent mountains which are
part of the Antarctica ranges.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Mount Vinson was named after
a former US state senator.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that gives us

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
an idea of the location where
the fallen angels are buried.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the "Book
of Enoch" it said

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.870 align:middle line:84%
that they would be imprisoned
there for 10,000 years.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.792 align:middle line:84%
So this was just
before the last flood

00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:44.875 align:middle line:90%
that they were imprisoned.

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which was
about that long.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.296 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: That's right.

00:11:47.296 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
in that time range

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:90%
of 10,000 to 12,000 years.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this where
Lucifer was also put--

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and Satan, because they
were fallen angels too,

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.806 align:middle line:90%
weren't they?

00:11:56.806 --> 00:11:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: They are.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.525 align:middle line:84%
This is also described
in the "Book of Enoch."

00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
It describes the second
heaven and the fifth heaven

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
in the "Book of
Enoch" as described

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.579 align:middle line:84%
as where Satan is actually
banished to the fifth heaven.

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They put
him someplace else.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: This seems to
be a different location

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
to these fallen angels that
interbred with humanity

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:90%
are put.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: They are in Antarctica.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they the Nephilim?

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: The Nephilim are the
offspring, they are the giants.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
They're the children of these
fallen angels interbreeding

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:90%
with humanity.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what
we're looking at here

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
is genetic experimentation
or some manner

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.475 align:middle line:84%
by which extraterrestrials were
able to genetically interbreed

00:12:45.475 --> 00:12:47.015 align:middle line:90%
with our human females.

00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must have been
very similar to us in order

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.660 align:middle line:90%
to breed, I would guess.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if you try to
breed a dog and a cat,

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to happen.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So there must have
been some similarities

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.475 align:middle line:84%
between these so-called fallen
angels and human beings.

00:13:03.475 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Definitely.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that there were some
genetic characteristics that

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:84%
could be exploited in
these hybrid programs.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that is emphasized

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.380 align:middle line:84%
is that the Nephilim
were giants.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So you would have a normal-sized
woman who would give birth to--

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.842 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a normal-sized
fallen angel, right?

00:13:24.842 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, whether
they physically mated

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.496 align:middle line:84%
or whether it was some kind
of genetic intervention.

00:13:30.496 --> 00:13:31.662 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Manipulation, sure.

00:13:31.662 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Some sort
of artificial--

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:33.886 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Insemination.

00:13:33.886 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Insemination program.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
But these women would give
birth to these giants, 15,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:90%
16 foot tall.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it was a more gradual
process where maybe you

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
would have the
women giving birth

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
to giants that were maybe eight
foot tall, nine foot tall.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their offspring.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.846 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: And their
offspring would

00:13:52.846 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:90%
be maybe 15 foot, and so forth.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So however they did it,
the Nephilim were giants

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and that they were
all over the Earth.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And that during the
last ice age, which

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:84%
corresponds with the Great
Flood, the leaders, the fallen

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
angels themselves were
imprisoned in Antarctica.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.874 align:middle line:84%
And that these
giants were now left

00:14:12.874 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
to fend for themselves
because now they were cut off

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:15.840 align:middle line:90%
from their leaders.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why
imprison them there?

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, this gets
into the interesting question

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:84%
of Antarctica being a place
of extraterrestrial refugees

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:84%
finding a suitable location
after some kind of cataclysm

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:90%
in other worlds.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So Mars and the
asteroid belt are

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.270 align:middle line:84%
both places that are speculated
to be where there was once a--

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another planet.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: A planet between--

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.237 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mars and Jupiter.

00:14:49.237 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Mars and Jupiter.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And that planet had a
satellite, which was Mars then,

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and our moon.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And that because of some kind
of cataclysm, this super Earth

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
was destroyed, and Mars
was pushed into orbit,

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and the asteroid
belt was created.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
lot of refugees.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And they found their
way to Antarctica.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And actually there's a famous
remote viewing experiment

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that was commissioned
by the CIA that

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
got Joseph McMoneagle
to actually remote view

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Mars about a million
years ago at the time

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
of some great cataclysm.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And he described some
kind of planetary ark

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:84%
that took the refugee
martians to a location that

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.860 align:middle line:90%
was very volcanic.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And they had some advanced
spacecraft that took him there.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Now in the book,
"Antarctica's Hidden History,"

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I actually examine
these documents.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the
place they took them to

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:84%
was Antarctica,
because Antarctica

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:84%
was at that time in a
temperate region of the planet.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't where it is
now in the South Pole.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
It was probably more
where Australia is now.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was temperate,
but it was also

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:90%
very volcanic and very rich.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And this was where the martian
spacecraft crash landed.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And so this became the hub of a
future worldwide civilization,

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:90%
which people called Atlantis.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing story.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the "Book of Enoch,"

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
the Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls,
it's all relative, isn't it?

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
It all makes sense
when you combine them.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, it's like
when you look at the Bible,

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it as these are
historic documents where you

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.132 align:middle line:84%
have people trying to describe
supernatural events involving

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:42.215 align:middle line:84%
advanced technologies that
they didn't understand.

00:16:42.215 --> 00:16:43.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:16:43.015 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: So they
use layman's term,

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
like how do you describe
a ship, a space--

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You call it
a wheel or whatever.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: You call it a wheel
or a chariot or something,

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
a flying chariot, or
whatever you call it.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you look
at these documents

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
as being historic descriptions
of supernatural events

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:84%
involving extraterrestrials with
these advanced technologies,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:90%
then it starts to make sense.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:84%
And so the "Book of Enochs,"
the three of them, I think,

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
describe very important events
just before the last Great

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:84%
Flood that I think is very
important for us to understand,

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:84%
well, could this
happen again now.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Could we be on the verge
of something very similar

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.950 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's very uncanny
that the "Book of Enoch"

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:84%
says that the fallen
angels that were imprisoned

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.710 align:middle line:84%
would be released
after 10,000 years.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And that corresponds with
what many biblical researchers

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
are saying, that the fallen
angels are being released.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
That there are certain elites,
the Cabal, the Illuminati,

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want
to call them, that

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
are wanting to
release these beings

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and basically reinstall
them in some kind

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:90%
of planetary leadership role.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
the "Book of Enoch"

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:84%
supports the
possibility of that.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be
widespread interest today

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica much more than
even the years gone past.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.589 align:middle line:84%
Former Secretary of State
John Kerry visited there.

00:18:11.589 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Something is going
on there, Michael.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.836 align:middle line:90%
What's your gut tell you?

00:18:14.836 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: I think
that there are things

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that are being uncovered
because the ice is

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:90%
melting in Antarctica.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Many countries have
bases down there,

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to
dig under the ice

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:84%
to large caverns that
are being discovered.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.466 align:middle line:84%
Because now the radar
mapping technologies

00:18:33.466 --> 00:18:34.715 align:middle line:90%
are becoming so sophisticated.

00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they
are, they're amazing.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: That they can now look
what's under the ice sheet.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can penetrate.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Exactly.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So the Chinese, the Russians,
the Indians, the French,

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:84%
the Canadians,
Americans, they're

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
all seeing what's
buried under the ice.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they're all
trying to dig deep down

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
to get there first
so that they can then

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
stake their interest
in what's down there.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that whatever
is ultimately found,

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that they can
benefit in some way.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever got the
Nazis interested in Antarctica?

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, the
Nazis were interested

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
because they ideologically
were influenced very much

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
by the secret societies,
the Thule Secret Society,

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the occult.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: The occult, that was
a big part of the Thule Secret

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Society.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And the Thulians believed
in an ancient underground

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.970 align:middle line:84%
civilization called
Hyperboreal Thule.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And that the capital of that
underground civilization

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:90%
was Ultima Thule.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So the Thule society
were very much convinced

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that there was an underground
civilization with an Aryan

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:84%
super race, so they wanted
to make contact with that.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And so they set up a program to
make contact with those beings,

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:84%
start to learn about
advanced technologies,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
because part of the ideology
was that only those who

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:84%
had sufficiently developed
their scientific skill set

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and evolved enough in
terms of consciousness

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
would be able to become the
inheritors of these advanced

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.410 align:middle line:84%
technologies that the
Hyperboreans had developed

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:90%
tens of thousands of years ago.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the Nazis were very
interested in Antarctica

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
because they believed
that this was

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:84%
a location that was relevant
to this ancient Hyperborean

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.259 align:middle line:84%
And so starting from 1936
during the Olympic games.

00:20:20.259 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through the war.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: And right
up until the war,

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
they came up with plans to
begin colonizing Antarctica,

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:84%
because this was how the
Third Reich envisaged itself

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
as restoring the German empire
through a colony in Antarctica

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:84%
where they would actually
find these ancient artifacts

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and these buried technologies
and reverse engineer

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.495 align:middle line:84%
these to become the most
powerful nation on the planet.

00:20:47.495 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
heard that they

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
had an underwater
submarine base there?

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.175 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Yes, again,
these are all the rumors.

00:20:55.175 --> 00:20:55.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rumors.

00:20:55.975 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: That have been
around for a long time,

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
that the Germans developed
the first modern submarines,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
the U-boat XXI or
the U21, that this

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
was the first modern
submarine because it

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
could stay under water
for submerged periods.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So it was very capable of
ferrying supplies and manpower

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
long distances down
to Antarctica or South

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.220 align:middle line:84%
America as a staging post to
then find some hidden entry

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:90%
into Antarctica itself.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get into
some of the scientific research

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:84%
into the underground waterways
or the under-ice waterways

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:84%
of Antarctica that shows
that underneath the ice there

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
is an extensive network
of flowing rivers.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.162 align:middle line:90%
And so these go--

00:21:46.162 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Man-made or natural?

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Natural,
natural rivers.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And that these are
navigable for submarines

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.574 align:middle line:90%
if you know where they are.

00:21:55.574 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Passage ways.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Exactly.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had always heard
too that maybe Hitler had

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.445 align:middle line:84%
escaped there for a while
before he went to Argentina.

00:22:02.445 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, one
of the big questions

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
has always been,
well, to what extent

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:84%
was Hitler in charge of
the colonies in Antarctica.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Because it was always
controversial as to

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.266 align:middle line:84%
whether or not Hitler
was his own man

00:22:17.266 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:90%
or whether he was a puppet.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways I think he
could dictate many policies--

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
he was responsible for the Nazi
war program and the genocide

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But as far as Antarctica
was controlled,

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
my research shows that he
wasn't in control of Antarctica.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:84%
That in fact after the war and
after his disastrous policy

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
choices, he wasn't
welcome in Antarctica.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So he was given exile
in South America where

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
he could go to
Argentina, he could

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:90%
go to places like Colombia.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And he was given
an honorary status.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But effectively he
ceased to be the leader

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:90%
of the German forthright.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there hidden Nazi
technology there in Antarctica?

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Definitely.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the things
that we know from the research

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:84%
or what William
Tompkins has disclosed.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.464 align:middle line:84%
He was part of a US
Navy espionage program

00:23:14.464 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:90%
during the second World War.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.754 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe the guy.

00:23:16.754 --> 00:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Yeah, he
has the documents

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to prove that he was actually
part of a covert program.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And he says that
the US Navy learned

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:31.350 align:middle line:84%
that the Nazis had established
bases in Antarctica

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:84%
where they were developing
these advanced flying

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:90%
saucer technologies.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this was one of the
justifications for the Navy

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:84%
sending Admiral Byrd down
there on missions to find out,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.755 align:middle line:84%
firstly, what were
the Nazis doing,

00:23:44.755 --> 00:23:47.490 align:middle line:84%
see if the Nazis were
willing to negotiate.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And when the Nazis
showed that they weren't

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
willing to negotiate,
then they sent down

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Operation Highjump, which
was designed to take out

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:90%
the bases down there.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:90%
But they had a big surprise.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.265 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at Admiral Byrd.

00:24:00.265 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Strangely enough there's
left in the world today an area

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:10%
as big as the United States
that's never been seen by human

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:08.940 align:middle line:10%
beings.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:10%
And that's beyond the pole on
the other side of the South

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.330 align:middle line:10%
Pole from middle America.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:19.440 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's
quite astonishing

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:10%
that there should be an area
as big as that unexplored.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a tremendous.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.795 align:middle line:10%
So there's a lot of
adventure left down

00:24:24.795 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:10%
at the bottom of the world.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:10%
>> General, do you
hope to see that?

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I do.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:32.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Admiral, would you say
that since you've been to both

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:10%
the extremities of Earth, are
these expeditions to such far

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:10%
off places, are they're getting
easier because of modern

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:10%
techniques?

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.415 align:middle line:10%
Or is danger still
close at hand?

00:24:41.415 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's a little risky,
but nothing like it used to be

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:10%
with the old, slow planes and
the small cruising radius where

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:10%
we had to put down bases.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:10%
We replaced the dog teams.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:10%
And of course that
was a big improvement.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.160 align:middle line:10%
But now the planes
go much faster,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:10%
and they're safer and have a
much bigger cruising radius.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.120 align:middle line:10%
You haven't got the danger
of a terribly heavy load.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Admiral, an expedition
to which I believe you are

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.750 align:middle line:10%
the advisor is now en route.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:10%
What is that expedition doing?

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that's the Icebreaker.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.612 align:middle line:10%
And it's a reconnaissance
expedition.

00:25:20.612 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:10%
It's going down to
the South Pole area

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:10%
to make certain observations
and to look for some bases.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.920 align:middle line:10%
They will be back in April,
and they will report back.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:10%
And upon the information we
get from that undertaking,

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.236 align:middle line:10%
we will base the bigger
expedition that's to follow.

00:25:41.236 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Is that very definitely
planned, or is that?

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:10%
>> That is being
planned right now.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:10%
So I'm willing to
say to you that there

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:53.700 align:middle line:10%
will be a number of expeditions
that will follow I think

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.830 align:middle line:10%
year-after-year,
bottom of the world,

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:10%
because the government has
really become interested.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Admiral Byrd,
I can understand,

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.678 align:middle line:10%
I think everybody can, the
interest of the North Pole

00:26:02.678 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:10%
because it's so near
our greatest challenger,

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:10%
Soviet Russia.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:10%
But why this interest in
the bottom of the world?

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.945 align:middle line:10%
Nobody living down
there, is there?

00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:14.569 align:middle line:10%
>> No, it's pretty cold.

00:26:14.569 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:10%
There's only one
permanent resident--

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:10%
that's the emperor penguin.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:10%
The little ones
live further north.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you one reason
they're interested--

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:10%
it's by far the most
valuable important place

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:32.040 align:middle line:10%
left in the world for science.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he right
about that, Michael?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Was it the most valuable
place for science?

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: It is, but not in
the way he described them.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
He was making it look
as though this was--

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
hedging something.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: It was much more than
just doing scientific research

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.244 align:middle line:84%
on the glaciers and on the
wildlife there in Antarctica

00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and seeing if there were
coal deposits and so forth.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.451 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wasn't telling
us everything, was he?

00:26:57.451 --> 00:26:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Definitely not, no.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Byrd, he
was someone that

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:84%
was very comfortable in
operating under the secrecy

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:90%
system that the Navy had.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless he did
disclose some aspects

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:14.280 align:middle line:84%
of what was really the agenda
down there for Operation

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Highjump, because that was
a flotilla of Navy ships--

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:84%
an aircraft carrier, 4,700
sailors and Marines went

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.490 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And in March of 1947 when he
was returning back to the United

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
States after Operation Highjump
had come to a premature end,

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:84%
he gave an interview
in Chile where

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.230 align:middle line:84%
he was much more
forthcoming about what

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.142 align:middle line:90%
was the real purpose.

00:27:38.142 --> 00:27:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was with a
reporter, his name was Atta.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Correct.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Lee Van Atta.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And he told Lee Van
Atta that basically they

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.250 align:middle line:84%
had suffered
significant casualties

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and that there was
a new enemy that

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:90%
could fly from pole to pole.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: And get to the United
States territory very quickly.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was that enemy?

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: That's the
big question, because--

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.101 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It wasn't the Soviets.

00:28:03.101 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: The Soviets
certainly at the North Pole

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.450 align:middle line:90%
had that capability.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:90%
But not out of the South Pole.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:10%
And so there he was alluding
to the German program,

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.700 align:middle line:10%
the German space
program, according

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.890 align:middle line:10%
to what William
Tompkins has told us

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:10%
that had been
established in Antarctica

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:10%
and that had grown so
quickly that by the time

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:10%
the Navy had sent down Operation
Highjump the US Navy jets were

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:10%
no match for these operational
flying saucer craft that

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:10%
had some very
advanced technologies.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Laser weapons, for
example, that could

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:84%
shoot down Navy ships
or Navy aircraft,

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.709 align:middle line:84%
and even destroy some
of the Navy ships.

00:28:42.709 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow, now we've got
scientists down there right

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.380 align:middle line:90%
now, Michael.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And other nations have
scientists down there.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:49.675 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:28:49.675 --> 00:28:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, they're doing
a lot of conventional science

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:58.395 align:middle line:84%
projects, doing some deep
ice drilling to measure.

00:28:58.395 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The core.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Identify
what kind of evidence

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.090 align:middle line:84%
they find of the ancient
ecosystem in Antarctica,

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:84%
because mainstream
science believes

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:84%
that Antarctica has been under
ice for several million years

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they're digging down
to find ice core samples that

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:84%
can give them a timeline of
how over the millions of years

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica's ecosystem
has adapted to the ice.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.910 align:middle line:84%
But of course that
ignores the evidence

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:84%
that in fact Antarctica as
recently as 13,000 years ago

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.770 align:middle line:84%
during the last ice age
was actually ice-free.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So without the ice
there is landmass there, right?

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Definitely.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:43.827 align:middle line:84%
Landmass with vast
river systems and--

00:29:43.827 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Vegetation.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:45.855 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Big lakes.

00:29:45.855 --> 00:29:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have trees,
everything down there,

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:47.550 align:middle line:90%
didn't they?

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.383 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Definitely.

00:29:48.383 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And especially if we
consider that Antarctica

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.190 align:middle line:84%
was in another
region of the Earth,

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:middle line:84%
that if its latitude
was much higher.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Not down
at the South Pole.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that brings in the
possibility of a pole shift

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:84%
that Charles Hapgood
talked about,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.830 align:middle line:84%
and that Albert
Einstein endorsed.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Continental divide--
got it down there, too?

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, the whole thing
of like Continental drift,

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.335 align:middle line:84%
that explains it a little bit
about how continents are formed

00:30:16.335 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:90%
or how it might have moved.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But for Antarctica to
move so dramatically

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.894 align:middle line:84%
from a temperate region
to the South Pole,

00:30:24.894 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
it would take much more
than just continental drift.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.226 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: So that's where we
have to consider the ideas

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:90%
of Hapgood and a pole shift.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
things that certainly

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:84%
some of the insiders
have been talking about,

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.070 align:middle line:84%
evidence of a flash
frozen civilization

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.245 align:middle line:84%
that has been discovered
under the ice sheets.

00:30:44.245 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And that this is something
that is going to be announced.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Transnational
Corporate Space Program--

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:84%
what's going on today in
that aspect down there?

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, the
Transnational Corporate Program

00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:84%
was something that emerged
as a result of a fusion

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.230 align:middle line:84%
or a cooperation between
German corporations

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:84%
that were building
these spacecraft

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:10.800 align:middle line:84%
for the German
program immediately

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:90%
during and after the war.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
1950s, agreements

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.742 align:middle line:84%
had been reached with the
Eisenhower administration.

00:31:17.742 --> 00:31:19.200 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned
earlier on, that was

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.182 align:middle line:84%
part of the research
I'd been doing in 2003.

00:31:22.182 --> 00:31:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
still ongoing today.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Those agreements
are still valid,

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and they made
possible cooperation

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:84%
between German corporations
and American corporations

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that over the years
have basically

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:40.790 align:middle line:84%
merged their efforts, shared
personnel, shared technologies.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So now it's grown into a
transnational corporate space

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:84%
program that has continued
the policies that

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:53.390 align:middle line:84%
had been initially created
for the German corporations

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
use a lot of slave labor

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.160 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being able to test
some of these technologies, how

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.410 align:middle line:90%
humans would adapt to those.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And that continues
to the present day.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
launching down there?

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.870 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about a
Secret Space Program, to me

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like Cape
Canaveral all over again.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Are we doing
anything down there?

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, it all
depends what we're

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:90%
talking about in terms of we.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a Transnational
Corporate Space program.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But are we
launching things down there?

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: They are launching
things, definitely.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are?

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: They are.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They have a very active
program down there

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:90%
where they are launching craft.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a very active place
for flying saucers.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe,
she interviewed

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Brian, the Navy
flight engineer who

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.660 align:middle line:84%
described seeing these silver
flying saucers in the 1990s.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which you
think are man-made?

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Those are
man-made-- yes.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the silver
fleet down there

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that's associated with
the German programs.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So these have been ongoing
since the Germans were first

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:06.810 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: And they're able
to fly into deep space

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:90%
from Antarctica.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's a
transnational program,

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:84%
which is not controlled in
any way by the US military.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Even though US military--

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But we're part of it.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: We're
linked in through--

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somehow.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: These
negotiations where

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:28.970 align:middle line:84%
US multinational
corporations have

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.360 align:middle line:84%
agreed to work with this German
program that was initially

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:90%
set up.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And US military
intelligence tries

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.620 align:middle line:84%
to monitor the programs that are
down there, but they can only

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.276 align:middle line:84%
get so much in terms of those
agreements because I think--

00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Ultimately
the Germans realize

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that even though they could come
up with agreements with the US

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.720 align:middle line:84%
military industrial
complex, that ultimately

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
the US military had
its own distinct agenda

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and they would never
be true allies.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So the best technologies were
kept away from the US military.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where we get
into the US military setting up

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.250 align:middle line:84%
indigenous space
programs where they've

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.920 align:middle line:84%
been doing their own
reverse engineering

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.440 align:middle line:84%
of captured extraterrestrials
craft, and so forth.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.489 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In 1955, Deep Freeze,
another program that involved

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Admiral Richard Byrd.

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Strenuous observations.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.659 align:middle line:10%
One of the most extensive of all
International Geophysical Year

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:10%
investigations is taking place
in the Antarctic regions,

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.929 align:middle line:10%
with 11 nations participating.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:38.010 align:middle line:10%
In an effort to help find
answers to these questions,

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.004 align:middle line:10%
the United States Antarctic
program was conceived.

00:34:41.004 --> 00:34:44.340 align:middle line:10%
And by direction of the
President of the United States,

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:10%
Rear Admiral Richard E.
Byrd, veteran polar explorer,

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.889 align:middle line:10%
was named officer in charge.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.500 align:middle line:10%
The Navy was assigned the
task of logistics support

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.909 align:middle line:10%
for the program.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:58.060 align:middle line:10%
Task Force 43 was organized
under commander-in-chief

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.210 align:middle line:10%
Atlantic fleet to implement
the operation, which

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:10%
was assigned the code name,
Operation Deep Freeze.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:10%


00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.175 align:middle line:10%
Rear Admiral George Dufek
was appointed commander

00:35:09.175 --> 00:35:12.730 align:middle line:10%
of Task Force 43, with
the responsibility

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.640 align:middle line:10%
to construct bases,
operate them, supply,

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:10%
and resupply them, and
transport scientists

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:10%
to and from Antarctica.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.860 align:middle line:10%
The major objectives of
Operation Deep Freeze, one,

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:10%
were to establish
a main IGY base

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:10%
near the site of the former
Little Americas and an air

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:34.025 align:middle line:10%
facility at McMurdo Sound,
investigate Marie Byrd

00:35:34.025 --> 00:35:37.420 align:middle line:10%
Land and the South Pole for
suitable scientific observation

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:42.190 align:middle line:10%
posts, to support a planned
US scientific program

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:46.900 align:middle line:10%
in the Antarctic, and provide
logistic support for the United

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.649 align:middle line:10%
States participation in IGY.

00:35:49.649 --> 00:35:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This could
go down, Michael,

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:90%
as one of the greatest stories.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.390 align:middle line:84%
There's so much activity
going on down there.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Right.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.210 align:middle line:84%
The things that we're beginning
to discover in Antarctica,

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:84%
really a result of many
decades of secret agreements

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:90%
and projects that have emerged.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Operation Deep Freeze,
it's noteworthy

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that that happened in 1955,
'56, which was immediately

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.860 align:middle line:84%
after these secret
agreements had

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.560 align:middle line:84%
been reached between the
Eisenhower administration

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and the German
colonies in Antarctica.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
those agreements,

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.760 align:middle line:84%
the US was then allowed to
establish permanent bases

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.960 align:middle line:90%
in Antarctica.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And so then they set up the
infrastructure for Antarctica

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to have many nations come in
and establish year round bases.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And they set up the
International Geophysical Year

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:84%
where they could begin to
do more research into all

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:48.200 align:middle line:84%
of the aspects of conducting
science research in Antarctica.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this Operation
Deep Freeze really

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:55.780 align:middle line:84%
was an important
milestone on the opening

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.519 align:middle line:84%
up of Antarctica as a result
of these secret agreements.

00:36:58.519 --> 00:37:00.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think we
have troops down there now?

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well,
not so much troops

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:08.015 align:middle line:84%
because the Antarctic Treaty
rules out any nation having

00:37:08.015 --> 00:37:08.890 align:middle line:90%
troops in Antarctica.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:09.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does, right.

00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: It requires nations
to mainly conduct themselves

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:84%
solely to scientific research
or peaceful exploration.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So no military
research is allowed.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But really that hides the
fact that deep underground you

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.580 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of military research
that's being conducted.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But this is done under
the auspices of what

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:84%
the Germans had
set up down there,

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and that has evolved into this
transnational space program.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing a lot
of military research

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:84%
down there under the
Antarctic ice sheet.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So you have this paradox where
on the surface of Antarctica

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:84%
you have this peaceful
scientific research

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:56.590 align:middle line:84%
environment where there is
no military research allowed.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Whereas under the
ice sheets, you

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.280 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of military activity.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would we be going
nuts if we knew exactly

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.360 align:middle line:90%
what was happening down there?

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.575 align:middle line:84%
The American public, would
we be just wowed by it?

00:38:08.575 --> 00:38:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: I think so because what
the American public would learn

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.060 align:middle line:84%
is that there are these
vast industrial production

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.560 align:middle line:90%
facilities in Antarctica.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are US-based companies
too involved with that?

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: US companies are
involved in this Transnational

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Corporate program.

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they're building
components because

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.070 align:middle line:90%
of compartmentalization.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
William Tompkins emphasized

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.955 align:middle line:84%
was that the construction of
these advanced craft precision

00:38:40.955 --> 00:38:44.245 align:middle line:84%
are a very compartmentalized
process where

00:38:44.245 --> 00:38:48.730 align:middle line:84%
you can have US companies
building millions of parts that

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:84%
would be assembled together in a
remote location like Antarctica

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.150 align:middle line:84%
into, say, a
mile-long spacecraft.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Or whether it's a
mile-long spacecraft

00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:00.580 align:middle line:84%
in a remote area
of the Utah desert,

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.960 align:middle line:84%
which is part of the Navy space
program, according to Tompkins.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But you have this
construction process

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:84%
that was developed
by the Germans

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.820 align:middle line:90%
where you have building blocks.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.790 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
LEGO, that you'd just

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.060 align:middle line:84%
build these compartments that
can be all linked together

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.390 align:middle line:90%
for building these vast ships.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And US companies
have been involved

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.405 align:middle line:90%
in that since the 1950s.

00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, do you think
that if the American public

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.860 align:middle line:84%
knew exactly what
was going down there,

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.510 align:middle line:90%
that we would be in shock?

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: I think people would
be amazed about exactly--

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Surprised?

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: How advanced
the technologies were.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Very surprised over that.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But then also very shocked to
learn about the abuses that

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.740 align:middle line:90%
have occurred.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of abuses?

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Because the Germans
believed during the Second

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.470 align:middle line:84%
World War that slave
labor was going

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:58.845 align:middle line:84%
to be a part of their
peacetime operations.

00:39:58.845 --> 00:39:59.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:39:59.645 --> 00:40:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: And so slave
labor was an official part

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:03.050 align:middle line:90%
of Nazi ideology.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We would've
known there's slave labor,

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't we?

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.410 align:middle line:90%
That was their plan.

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, they would have
worked with US companies who

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.730 align:middle line:84%
would have known that part
of the price of collaborating

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:17.790 align:middle line:84%
with the Germans was that they
would be using slave labor.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
compromised US companies.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And the US military
intelligence community

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.930 align:middle line:84%
would have been aware
of this, that people

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that were being disappeared
around the planet,

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that many of these people were
being taken to Antarctica as

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.160 align:middle line:84%
used for slave labor or human
subjects in very large--

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Experiments?

00:40:35.035 --> 00:40:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Experiments down there.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:40:36.495 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2002 something
happened about a secret policy,

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and it was tied into the
discovery of frozen people

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.375 align:middle line:90%
in a civilization down there?

00:40:47.375 --> 00:40:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, 2002
was very interesting

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.520 align:middle line:84%
because this was
when rumors began

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.740 align:middle line:84%
to emerge of the discovery
of a civilization found

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.255 align:middle line:90%
under the Antarctic ice sheets.

00:40:59.255 --> 00:41:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Obviously, dead.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Yes, that
these were ruins.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:04.720 align:middle line:90%
So these were ruins.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.511 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they find
skeletons of people?

00:41:06.511 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Apparently so, yes.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But these were
rumors at the time.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And there were
reports that emerged

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that haven't been
confirmed, basically

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:84%
described being a videography
team that went down there that

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.150 align:middle line:90%
filmed some of these ruins.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And that when they
came out of the ice

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
or out of the
underground regions

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that the film was
confiscated and the film crew

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.175 align:middle line:90%
was imprisoned.

00:41:37.175 --> 00:41:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: But this
wasn't confirmed.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.641 align:middle line:84%
And it emerged later that this
was something that was like--

00:41:43.641 --> 00:41:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This could
have happened, though.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, something
like that was happening.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that there were film
crews being sent down there

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.150 align:middle line:84%
to film the artifacts that had
been discovered under the ice

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.950 align:middle line:90%
sheets.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But that particular
case, I think,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.106 align:middle line:84%
was disinformation
to hide the truth.

00:42:01.106 --> 00:42:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
of the principles

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.720 align:middle line:84%
they use, George, is you hide
the truth in plain sight.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.160 align:middle line:84%
You come up with a
hoax to hide the truth.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:08.960 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To hide the truth.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.156 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: There were videography
teams and scientific teams

00:42:12.156 --> 00:42:14.720 align:middle line:84%
going under the
Antarctic ice filming

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.140 align:middle line:84%
the ruins of these cities,
that major corporations.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And this was one of the
things that Richard Hoagland

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:25.520 align:middle line:84%
actually did some important
breakthrough research on

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and found some insiders back
in 2002 saying that Raytheon

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.470 align:middle line:84%
was the US company that was
involved in sending contractors

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.810 align:middle line:84%
down there under the
Antarctic ice sheet

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.365 align:middle line:84%
to do the research into these
ruins that had been discovered.

00:42:39.365 --> 00:42:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't you like to
see the film of these ruins?

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: I would
love to see that.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me, too.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.236 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: That would be
something for everyone.

00:42:46.236 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Historical.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.570 align:middle line:84%
The craft that you say
might be down there now,

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.470 align:middle line:84%
that they're
launching, might they

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:58.690 align:middle line:84%
be what we consider to be
UFOs here when we see things?

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Could it be those craft?

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, we
need to differentiate

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:08.010 align:middle line:84%
between these ancient
mother ships that came down

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:13.686 align:middle line:84%
after this catastrophe on
Mars that landed in Antarctica

00:43:13.686 --> 00:43:14.935 align:middle line:90%
or crash landed in Antarctica.

00:43:14.935 --> 00:43:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And those
were from ETs, right?

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Those were
extraterrestrial,

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and they formed the hub
of a civilization that

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.830 align:middle line:90%
became planet-wide.

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:84%
But then after the ice
sheets began to grow,

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.140 align:middle line:84%
after the catastrophe, this
was all buried under the ice.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Then you had the Germans come
in during the Second World

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:41.890 align:middle line:84%
War building a space program,
these fleets of spacecraft that

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:84%
has now become a transnational
program that operates out

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:90%
of Antarctica.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And they can be very large
craft, a whole range of craft.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.120 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
triangle-shaped craft,

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.570 align:middle line:90%
dart-shaped craft.

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:58.037 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Phoenix lights,
1997, mile-long object

00:43:58.037 --> 00:43:58.870 align:middle line:90%
they think they saw.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.005 align:middle line:84%
Might it have
originated down there?

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Well, it could be.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.610 align:middle line:84%
We don't know whether that
was a genuine extraterrestrial

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:84%
triangle, because
that was very large.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be much
larger than the TR3B

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.640 align:middle line:84%
that many researchers
have been describing,

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.330 align:middle line:90%
which is about 600 feet in size.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
With the Phoenix
lights, some estimate

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.400 align:middle line:90%
that to be a mile wide.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
something that, if it's not

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.580 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial, it belongs to
something much more advanced,

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're talking
about a Navy space program

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:35.050 align:middle line:84%
out of say Utah,
or whether we're

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:84%
talking about a transnational
program out of Antarctica.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Do we know if the
ice sheets down there

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.315 align:middle line:90%
are melting or growing?

00:44:46.315 --> 00:44:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, that is really
an important question, George.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look
at the scientific data,

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.810 align:middle line:84%
we can see that the ice sheets,
especially the Western Ice

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Sheets, the Ross Ice
Sheets, for example,

00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.455 align:middle line:90%
is melting very rapidly.

00:44:59.455 --> 00:45:00.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are.

00:45:00.255 --> 00:45:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: But the
data shows that it's

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Western Antarctica where
there has been the greatest

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:07.759 align:middle line:90%
temperature increase.

00:45:07.759 --> 00:45:08.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's very puzzling.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if global warming
is a result of the oceans

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.740 align:middle line:90%
heating up.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:13.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would be everywhere.

00:45:13.665 --> 00:45:15.414 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Exactly-- it
would be everywhere.

00:45:15.414 --> 00:45:16.780 align:middle line:90%
But it's West Antarctica.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what is it about
Western Antarctica that

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.675 align:middle line:84%
makes it a place that is
most prone to ice melt?

00:45:22.675 --> 00:45:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at what some
of the researchers are saying.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.150 align:middle line:90%


00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.330 align:middle line:10%
>> According to a study from
researchers at the University

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.780 align:middle line:10%
of Texas at Austin, glaciers
in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.980 align:middle line:10%
are melting quickly.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.840 align:middle line:10%
Not only because
of ocean erosion,

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.180 align:middle line:10%
but also because of
underground volcanic activity.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:10%
The researchers
used airborne radar

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.040 align:middle line:10%
to document the
geothermal activity

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:10%
underneath the Thwaites Glacier.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.780 align:middle line:10%
And the results show that it
is much hotter underground

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.120 align:middle line:10%
than previous estimates assumed.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.930 align:middle line:10%
Geothermal heat is caused by
magma and volcanic activity,

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:59.260 align:middle line:10%
which this study suggests might
be a major factor contributing

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.880 align:middle line:10%
to glacial melting.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.210 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Dustin Schroeder from the
University of Texas at Austin

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:05.800 align:middle line:10%
who worked on the
study is quoted

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.780 align:middle line:10%
as saying, "The
nearby volcanoes are

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.520 align:middle line:10%
an expression of the
crustal thinning,

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.850 align:middle line:10%
magma migration, and volcanism
associated with the West

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:14.530 align:middle line:10%
Antarctic rift system.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.530 align:middle line:10%
The pattern of melting and
geothermal flux we observed

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:21.430 align:middle line:10%
is also an expression of those
same associated processes."

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.830 align:middle line:10%
Using data collected by
radar, the researchers

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.860 align:middle line:10%
calculated the minimum
average geothermal heat flow

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.470 align:middle line:10%
under the glacier to be
around 100 milliwatts

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.360 align:middle line:10%
per square meter,
reaching as high

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.970 align:middle line:10%
as 200 milliwatts in some areas.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:36.250 align:middle line:10%
That's significantly higher
than the average heat

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.200 align:middle line:10%
flow of other
continents on Earth,

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.686 align:middle line:10%
which are reportedly under 65
milliwatts per square meter.

00:46:42.686 --> 00:46:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like putting an
ice cube in hot tea, isn't it,

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.505 align:middle line:84%
where it's melting
from the bottom,

00:46:49.505 --> 00:46:50.755 align:middle line:90%
and then everything collapses.

00:46:50.755 --> 00:46:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Right, you
have two to three miles

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:58.600 align:middle line:84%
of solid ice that is sitting
on top of these volcanoes that

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.190 align:middle line:90%
are becoming active.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's driving
the melting of the ice

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:05.530 align:middle line:90%
sheets in Antarctica.

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once these melt,
Michael, what do you

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:09.490 align:middle line:90%
think we're going to see?

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:12.309 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, that
is really the question

00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:13.600 align:middle line:90%
that everyone should be asking.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:14.766 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the big one.

00:47:14.766 --> 00:47:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Because the thing
is, we know from the research

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that Charles Hapgood had done
for his theory of the Earth's

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:27.970 align:middle line:84%
shifting crust or the
whole idea of pole shifts,

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that the amount of
ice at the poles

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.220 align:middle line:84%
is a direct factor in
influencing a pole shift.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.050 align:middle line:90%
And Albert Einstein no less--

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein, the world's
most famous scientist,

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.850 align:middle line:84%
actually endorsed
Hapgood's theory.

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:47.010 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a preface
to Hapgood's book

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:50.260 align:middle line:84%
where he described how
the centrifugal force is

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.567 align:middle line:84%
affected by the amount of
ice that's accumulated--

00:47:52.567 --> 00:47:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating work.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:54.733 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: At the ice sheet.

00:47:54.733 --> 00:47:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So you can see straightaway
if the West Antarctic Ice

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Sheet melts because of all
these volcanoes becoming active.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And as they become active,
George, it's a feedback loop.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Because as it melts, the
ice sitting above it,

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:13.280 align:middle line:84%
there's less ice that's
compacting the volcanoes, which

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.180 align:middle line:84%
has for thousands of
years been suppressing

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.270 align:middle line:90%
the volcanic eruption.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So now you're in
a feedback loop.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.510 align:middle line:84%
More ice melts, which
releases the pressure

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:26.110 align:middle line:84%
on the volcanoes, which now
are able to become more active.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to
more ice melt off.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So within a decade or
two, we could actually

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.680 align:middle line:84%
have miles of ice in
the West Antarctic

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.561 align:middle line:84%
region suddenly
disappearing because

00:48:37.561 --> 00:48:38.685 align:middle line:90%
of all of these volcanoes--

00:48:38.685 --> 00:48:39.935 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a good thing?

00:48:39.935 --> 00:48:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Becoming active.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I think personally it's going
to drive some dramatic changes

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:46.780 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, it's going to
expose a lot of what's

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:51.350 align:middle line:90%
been hidden under the ocean.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which I'd love to see.

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Everyone would.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So would you.

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Everyone would.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.960 align:middle line:84%
It's going to expose
a lot of that.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see a lot of
these ancient technologies that

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:02.130 align:middle line:90%
were down there.

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.619 align:middle line:84%
And that will make these
technologies something

00:49:04.619 --> 00:49:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that scientists from
around the world

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.380 align:middle line:90%
would begin to actively study.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It will make people question
conventional geophysical

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.940 align:middle line:84%
theories about
the shifting poles

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, if you
had a civilization that

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.110 align:middle line:84%
was flash frozen in Antarctica,
that means these pole

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.460 align:middle line:84%
shift theories are
very, very real.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But the more disturbing
possibility, of course,

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:32.800 align:middle line:84%
is that what is going to happen
if we have a new pole shift.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.110 align:middle line:84%
What happens with
all of this ice that

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.370 align:middle line:90%
melts in West Antarctica?

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
shorelines go up, right?

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Exactly.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.480 align:middle line:90%
The shorelines go up.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And even if we had a pole
shift of five to 10 degrees

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:48.190 align:middle line:84%
where the South
Pole suddenly moves

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.920 align:middle line:84%
into a more temperate
region, now you

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.310 align:middle line:90%
have more of a melt off.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything gets exposed.

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And now we return
back to that question

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:01.370 align:middle line:84%
that we were discussing earlier
with the "Book of Enoch."

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:05.276 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if the fallen angels
are buried in Antarctica?

00:50:05.276 --> 00:50:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will we find them?

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.885 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Will they
suddenly emerge?

00:50:07.885 --> 00:50:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will they have wings?

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Well.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I want to see them.

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: I don't know
if they will have wings,

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.410 align:middle line:84%
but I think that they
are extraterrestrials

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:17.830 align:middle line:84%
with advanced
technologies who were once

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:21.010 align:middle line:84%
the rulers of planet Earth,
and they're going to awaken.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:22.730 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to deal with them?

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:25.090 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to deal
with these extraterrestrials

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.647 align:middle line:84%
that wake up out of these stasis
chambers who had been asleep?

00:50:28.647 --> 00:50:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they're in
animation, suspended animation.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Totally.

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Been in suspended
animation, so for them it's

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.230 align:middle line:90%
like 30 minutes has elapsed.

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:37.491 align:middle line:84%
And they suddenly wake up
and say, oh, well, what

00:50:37.491 --> 00:50:38.740 align:middle line:90%
have you guys have been doing.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.530 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be the question.

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:42.160 align:middle line:90%
They have advanced technologies.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.570 align:middle line:90%
So do we.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:44.630 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.314 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to
negotiate with them?

00:50:46.314 --> 00:50:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to be
happy with the fact

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:51.400 align:middle line:84%
that human civilization
has evolved so quickly?

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.422 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to be happy
with us exercising self rule?

00:50:54.422 --> 00:50:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Or are they going to want
to re-establish rule?

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And eliminate us.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:05.040 align:middle line:84%
The landmass that was
there at some point

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.750 align:middle line:90%
was covered up by ice.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:09.570 align:middle line:84%
How long did that
take in your opinion

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:11.254 align:middle line:90%
to cover up the landmass?

00:51:11.254 --> 00:51:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: I think it could
have happened really

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.760 align:middle line:90%
quickly with a pole shift.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Because with a pole shift,
you can have the Earth's axis

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:25.320 align:middle line:84%
of rotation, the physical
rotation of the Earth's axis

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:31.110 align:middle line:84%
shifting from one location 20 to
30 degrees virtually overnight.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Hapgood
describes, is this happening

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.140 align:middle line:90%
within a few hours.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:36.362 align:middle line:90%
So within a few hours--

00:51:36.362 --> 00:51:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That much ice?

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: That the Earth's axis
of rotation could have shifted.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So now all of a
sudden was Antarctica

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:47.400 align:middle line:84%
in a temperate region
of the planet is now

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.230 align:middle line:90%
sitting in the South Pole.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you would have
had some sort of vortex

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:59.970 align:middle line:84%
where the air coming in from
the troposphere or some area

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:04.800 align:middle line:84%
of space comes down quickly into
Antarctica, causing everything

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.090 align:middle line:90%
to flash freeze.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the ice begins to
form over many, many centuries.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:12.750 align:middle line:90%
And now it's melting away.

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Exactly, so
what took many centuries

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to accumulate down
there in the South Pole

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:24.540 align:middle line:84%
is now being gradually melted
away in a matter of years.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And it might only
be a decade or two

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:31.439 align:middle line:84%
that we might see at least the
western region of Antarctica

00:52:31.439 --> 00:52:32.355 align:middle line:90%
being totally exposed.

00:52:32.355 --> 00:52:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What fascinates you
the most about that region?

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:40.990 align:middle line:84%
You've devoted your career,
you've devoted books.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:42.520 align:middle line:90%
What fascinates you about that?

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, the existence
of German's space program

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:48.130 align:middle line:84%
was the thing that
originally got

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:50.260 align:middle line:90%
me interested in Antarctica.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And the development of
this transnational space

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.970 align:middle line:84%
program down there I
found totally fascinating,

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:84%
to the degree that that
involved cooperation

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:04.994 align:middle line:84%
between German corporations and
US corporations and Europeans.

00:53:04.994 --> 00:53:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great story.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Incredible story.

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Just that was what
was originally

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.330 align:middle line:84%
behind my interest
in Antarctica.

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:16.840 align:middle line:84%
But as I continued to dig and
do more and more research,

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.810 align:middle line:84%
then I suddenly found
out that, wow, Antarctica

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:23.860 align:middle line:84%
is where these fallen angels or
these former extraterrestrial

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:26.320 align:middle line:84%
rulers of planet
Earth are buried.

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And the "Book of Enoch"
actually describes them awaking.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.460 align:middle line:84%
It actually says that the fallen
angels would be only imprisoned

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.960 align:middle line:90%
for 10,000 years.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that time
is up now, isn't it?

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Exactly.

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:90%
So this is it.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So now I think
that we really need

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.880 align:middle line:84%
to start considering
these books, the "Book

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.730 align:middle line:84%
of Enoch" and the
"Book of Jubilees,"

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:49.000 align:middle line:84%
these apocryphal books
that have been ignored

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.610 align:middle line:84%
by most biblical researchers,
We need to look at that

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and say that these are important
historical documents that

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:57.070 align:middle line:84%
tell us about the
history of the planet

00:53:57.070 --> 00:54:01.300 align:middle line:84%
just before the flood and
the history of Antarctica.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And that connects with what
Plato said about Atlantis.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that I'm
really fascinating in now.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'll continue to do
more research into that aspect

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.990 align:middle line:84%
of the connections between
the "Book of Enoch,"

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Plato, Atlantis, and what it
means for us if the fallen

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:18.859 align:middle line:90%
angels are suddenly awakened.

00:54:18.859 --> 00:54:20.316 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to deal with them?

00:54:20.316 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And their craft
that got them here--

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.130 align:middle line:90%
could be where?

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:24.100 align:middle line:90%
There?

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Exactly
that these craft

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:29.200 align:middle line:84%
have these very old
technologies which

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.760 align:middle line:84%
are a legacy of civilizations
that had developed

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.910 align:middle line:84%
on Mars and on this
Super Earth that

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:40.840 align:middle line:90%
was between Mars and Jupiter.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So again, what can this
technology tell us.

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And the "Book of
Enoch" describes

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:50.500 align:middle line:84%
the various technologies
that the angels had

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.980 align:middle line:84%
or the different
extraterrestrials had, but also

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.230 align:middle line:84%
described another
technology which

00:54:56.230 --> 00:55:00.220 align:middle line:84%
was revealed to Enoch that the
angels themselves didn't know.

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get into
this whole idea of builder race

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:07.040 align:middle line:84%
technology, technology which
is billions of years old

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.805 align:middle line:84%
which is only known to
whatever you call him--

00:55:09.805 --> 00:55:11.657 align:middle line:84%
God, the Lord,
still being the one.

00:55:11.657 --> 00:55:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That we don't
even know yet, right?

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: That even
the extraterrestrials

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.609 align:middle line:84%
don't know about
this technology,

00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:17.650 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:18.983 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would we find it there?

00:55:18.983 --> 00:55:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: That there's
technology in Antarctica.

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And that this was something
that was revealed to Enoch

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and then passed on
to his descendants.

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:33.730 align:middle line:84%
That this was something
that is carried over

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:36.760 align:middle line:84%
in the different books
that were written by Enoch.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Enoch wrote 360 books.

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:42.280 align:middle line:90%
We only have fragments of three.

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.545 align:middle line:90%
So where are these 360 books?

00:55:43.545 --> 00:55:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did they go?

00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Where did they go?

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.106 align:middle line:84%
Does the Vatican
Library have them?

00:55:47.106 --> 00:55:48.355 align:middle line:90%
Are they buried in Antarctica?

00:55:48.355 --> 00:55:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what do they say?

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Exactly.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that these
books have the secrets

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.420 align:middle line:84%
of this ancient
builder race technology

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.990 align:middle line:84%
that not only we want, but
also different extraterrestrial

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:00.660 align:middle line:90%
groups want to know about this.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.520 align:middle line:84%
That this was passed on to
Enoch and his descendants.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And so this I think
is really where

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:07.840 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have some
fascinating research

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.120 align:middle line:84%
over the next few
years as people start

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.780 align:middle line:84%
to look at these books
of Enoch as really having

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:16.900 align:middle line:84%
a fountain of wisdom
there, something

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:20.317 align:middle line:84%
that can help us learn about
extraterrestrial technologies

00:56:20.317 --> 00:56:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and the different hierarchies
of extraterrestrials that exist.

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been
to the South Pole, Michael?

00:56:25.565 --> 00:56:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: No.

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I do come from the
land down south.

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm from Australia,
but not that far south.

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quite that far south.

00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:33.464 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to go?

00:56:33.464 --> 00:56:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: I would.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.230 align:middle line:90%
I would like to go.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd like to
see much more than just

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:39.239 align:middle line:84%
what's at the surface
of Antarctica, though.

00:56:39.239 --> 00:56:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I think you'd need
to have clearance.

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But maybe as an Australian,
maybe the Australian government

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:45.500 align:middle line:84%
would allow me to go
down there and see.

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you go on
a submarine under there?

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Oh, definitely.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would do that?

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:49.501 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: I would do that.

00:56:49.501 --> 00:56:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think you'd find?

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:56.660 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the "Book of
Enoch" and it's accurate,

00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:01.220 align:middle line:84%
you'll probably find caverns
with these fallen angels,

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.630 align:middle line:90%
cities.

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:03.945 align:middle line:90%
What will you find down there?

00:57:03.945 --> 00:57:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: Well, I think this
is the critical question

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:13.040 align:middle line:84%
is if you are allowed to,
if you receive some help.

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.620 align:middle line:84%
The "Book of Enoch"
describes Enoch

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:19.250 align:middle line:84%
as actually having favor
in the eyes of God.

00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you are divinely inspired
or have some divine protection,

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:28.190 align:middle line:84%
then I think you could go in a
submarine by some modern nation

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and be guided to a location
and be protected and get access

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.800 align:middle line:90%
to these kinds of technology.

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.196 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's very possible.

00:57:34.196 --> 00:57:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
these are issues

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:37.670 align:middle line:84%
that the military industrial
complex knows about.

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:40.040 align:middle line:84%
They know they Antarctica
has all these secrets.

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
why they're there.

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: That's part of
the reason they're there.

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.176 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
why they're there.

00:57:45.176 --> 00:57:50.026 align:middle line:84%
Will we still find World War
II Nazi technology there?

00:57:50.026 --> 00:57:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: I believe so, yes.

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:58.760 align:middle line:84%
The Germans began building the
basis for this Fourth Reich

00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.960 align:middle line:90%
out of Antarctica.

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The Third Reich obviously
ended with the defeat

00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.960 align:middle line:90%
of Nazi Germany.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.040 align:middle line:90%
But the Fourth Reich--

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Continues, as
Joseph Farrell would say.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SALLA: Exactly.

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Farrell, Jim Marrs, they
talked about the Fourth Reich.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.615 align:middle line:84%
And Antarctica was an
important hub for this

00:58:13.615 --> 00:58:15.740 align:middle line:84%
because this is where the
advanced technology would

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:19.010 align:middle line:84%
be built to complement
the financial resources

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that the Fourth Reich had been
able to take out of Germany

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.030 align:middle line:90%
during the Second World War.

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:26.284 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Too bad that Jim
Marrs is no longer with us.

00:58:26.284 --> 00:58:28.575 align:middle line:84%
He would have loved to have
seen what's happening today

00:58:28.575 --> 00:58:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SALLA: I loved his
book, "The Fourth Reich."

00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I think he was right on it,
that, yes, Germany established

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:41.480 align:middle line:84%
a financial empire around the
world that continues today

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:46.640 align:middle line:84%
to be very, very dominant in
the financial, economic arena.

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.300 align:middle line:10%
And that to a
great extent we can

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:55.440 align:middle line:10%
say that the US is now
part of a Fourth Reich,

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.470 align:middle line:10%
but now we are
freeing ourselves.

00:58:57.470 --> 00:59:00.140 align:middle line:10%
And maybe this is what
we're witnessing today

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:03.520 align:middle line:10%
