>>JIMMY CHURCH: Hey,
everyone, I'm Jimmy Church.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:10%
You might know me from Into
the Vortex right here on Gaia.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:10%
And I'm honored to be sitting in
for George Noory on this episode

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:10%
of Beyond Belief.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is George Haas,
founder and lead investigator

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:90%
of the Cydonia Institute.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a research group dedicated
to exploring the mysterious

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and often controversial
structures

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:90%
found on the surface of Mars.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, for over 30 years, George
has been analyzing NASA images

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and uncovering
what he believes is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:84%
compelling evidence of
intelligent design of structures

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that may point to
an ancient Martian

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:84%
civilization with direct ties
to Earth's own mysterious past.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:84%
His latest book is The
Great Architects of Mars,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and it dives deep
into the theory

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and lays out some of the
truly astonishing discoveries.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
George, welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.460 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE J. HAAS: Well, thank
you for having me here, Jimmy.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.418 align:middle line:10%
I'm honored to be on your
show and look forward

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:10%
to our discussion today.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: Well,
it starts simply.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a very intriguing
and compelling subject, Mars.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But what inspired you
to get into the subject?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:10%
>>HAAS: Well, I
graduated high school.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:10%
I was a bicentennial
class, 1976.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So NASA had just sent up
their Viking 1 and Viking 2

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:90%
to take pictures of Mars.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So I just graduated
high school 1976.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed to
land in the Cydonia area.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.322 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up landing
in the Utopia area.

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
taking pictures,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
they had that weird picture
that kind of looked like a face.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:90%
NASA had a press conference.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:90%
It was on television.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They said they found
an odd structure that

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:84%
looked like a human face, and
everybody was kind of stunned.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.613 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
like a week later,

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
they had another
press conference.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And they said we had taken
a second picture of this,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and it was just a trick of
light and shadow and nothing

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:90%
to be concerned of.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:90%
No face here.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.737 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It certainly got a lot
of people interested in Mars,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:90%
didn't it?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
When that picture first
hit and, I saw it myself

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
in the newspaper,
we all wondered

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
if it was what we
thought it was.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Before they did the
second press conference,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:90%
where did your mind go?

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Did you go straight
there, that it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
is possible to have an
ancient civilization on Mars

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.803 align:middle line:84%
and start carving faces
on the tops of mountains?

00:02:43.803 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, like a lot
of people, I was intrigued.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this is
something to look at.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course, we
all believed that NASA,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.280 align:middle line:90%
they'd never lie.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:90%
And they said it was nothing.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of forgot about it
for a long time until I think it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
was in the early 1990s, when
they were going to go back

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
to Mars, and they were going to
take a new picture with the Mars

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Global Surveyor camera.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of reintroduced
my attention to Mars again.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: 25 years of
collecting images for the book--

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
how did you do that, and what
makes the cut for the book?

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, I've been doing
this for almost 30 years.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I've started doing it really
in depth in around 1991.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And I met a guy,
William Saunders,

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:84%
on Richard Hoagland's Enterprise
Mission discussion board.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.238 align:middle line:90%
And we got together.

00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
We had a lot of interest.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:84%
We were finding some
interesting stuff on Mars.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
We decided to put
a book together,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and we had our first
book published,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I think in 2005, called
the Cydonia Codex.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years later, 2009,
we produced a second book.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
They were produced by
North Atlantic Books,

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
again, dealing with all
these odd structures on Mars.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Subsequently, we
wrote a paper about--

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
which we'll be talking about
later-- a parrot formation.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And Bill and I got the
attention of the Society

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:90%
for Planetary SETI Research.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:90%
We became members.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
My co-author, Bill,
he's a geologist.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
My background-- I'm
not a scientist.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm an artist.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:90%
I went to art school.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm a sculptor, a painter.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So the reason the society was
interested in my background

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:90%
was because I had a visual eye.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
A geologist-- they're looking
at structures on Mars.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.338 align:middle line:84%
They're only looking for
the shape of the geology.

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking
for anything that

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
possibly could be artificial
because that's not even

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:90%
in their concept.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But my schooling, my training,
I know artwork when I see it.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
I know architecture
when I see it.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.452 align:middle line:84%
And Mars has it
all over the place.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Isn't it
interesting, you and I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:90%
have the same background.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to make
a comment on this.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Art was my background
too as well.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And artists do tend to look at
things a little bit differently.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And I have always been intrigued
with NASA's releases of images.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I would go and look at them,
and I've talked about this a lot

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
on the radio and on
my shows, that there

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
are things I would walk
to in these images,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
like they are-- there's
something there.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So I found myself always
on top of NASA's latest

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:90%
release of photos.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:90%
And I would pour into this.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Did you do the same thing
and cover NASA's next release

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:84%
of photos, and just
look at every single one

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
because there's
thousands of images?

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, they take so
many images every month.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little
difficult to travel and get

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:90%
into the archives.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But once you master
the technique

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the
NASA photographs,

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.013 align:middle line:90%
you can spend hours and hours.

00:05:53.013 --> 00:05:54.930 align:middle line:84%
You can get lost, down
the rabbit hole looking

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:90%
at NASA photographs.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, with our
background in art, also,

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:84%
we probably learned about
architecture and in art school.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So we know what
we're looking at.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And geologists,
they're looking just

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:84%
at what the rocks are looking
like, and anything that

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:90%
seems odd, they just dismiss.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And once you start
looking at Mars geology,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:84%
you get to know what the
natural formations look like.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And it just seems simple
to probably you and I

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
because anything
that's artificial

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
has geometry or symmetry
to it just jumps right you.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When you look
at the formations--

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.140 align:middle line:84%
or possible formations,
let's go with that.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I haven't been to Mars.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you have--

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:90%
would love to go.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's say what's
possible right now,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
but I see what appears to be
something that's not natural.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:90%
I see these formations.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And they do suggest
something else,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and they suggest
something intelligent.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.398 align:middle line:84%
Am I jumping ahead in
thinking like this?

00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: I don't think so.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
It just seems-- you don't
have to be a meteorologist

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to know which way the wind
blows or to look at the clouds

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:90%
and say, well, that's a cloud.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Although, that cloud kind of
looks like a lion or a tiger

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.130 align:middle line:90%
or a bear, oh, my.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Is that really a tiger?

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.395 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:90%
You know it's a cloud formation.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And they're usually very simple.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Normally, they just
have a contour.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:84%
There's no secondary
or tertiary features.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no eye and
iris and nose with--

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:84%
it's just usually a
very simple shape.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:84%
The cloud kind of
looks like a bear.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:90%
This one looks like a tiger.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you see contrails, you
know they're not natural.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So we can discern between
natural cloud formations

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and what is artificial.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, they'll have planes
that go up and do writing--

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:90%
I Love Lucy or I Love Suzy.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Or they make little smiley
faces with the planes,

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:90%
with the exhaust.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how they do that.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:90%
So we know what they are.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:90%
We know what natural clouds are.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And like Bob Dylan
said, you don't

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.590 align:middle line:84%
need to be a weatherman to
know which way the wind blows.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing with
what we're seeing on Mars.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So the
critics will always

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:84%
bring up pareidolia, which is
an honest thing to jump to.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Just like you just
said, your brain

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
is solving things for
you all of the time.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
is in our DNA from birth

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:90%
is the human face.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to see the human
face in just about anything

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
your brain does.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But some of these formations
have right angles,

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and they have geometry,
and there's other things

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:90%
that come into play.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't think pareidolia
is part of that.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
What is pareidolia
to you, and is it

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:84%
something that you need
to concern yourself with?

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, in the
1990s, early 2000s,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:90%
pareidolia was a big problem.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
There was an article
in Skeptical magazine

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that talked about
trying to diminish

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
any interest in
the face on Mars,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:84%
saying that people have
a tendency-- since birth,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:90%
you learn how to look at faces.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the first thing you see.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
That was the whole story,
was that pareidolia meant

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:90%
that you see faces everywhere.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
You see them in your faucet,
kind of looks like a nose

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:90%
and a pair of eyes.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But these things are
just natural formations

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:90%
that we know are not artificial.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
It has no intelligent
design to it.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with pareidolia,
where they got this word from,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
was from a science
journal about psychology.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was, I
think, back in 1868.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And in this journal,
there was an article

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:84%
about a hallucinatory problem,
that people were seeing faces

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.913 align:middle line:84%
everywhere-- in the
walls and in their coffee

00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
cup and all kinds of things.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:90%
So this was a mental disorder.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And they took that
word, which means

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
for people that suffer this
disorder of seeing faces

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, that we're seeing
faces everywhere because it's

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:90%
just a natural thing.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And that was what--

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I think NASA was very
happy to have that article

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:84%
out because it diminished any
interest in the face on Mars.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.617 align:middle line:84%
And any time you saw any
kind of figurative thing,

00:09:58.617 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:84%
like the parrot we'll talk
about, oh, that's pareidolia.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:90%
You see things all the time.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:90%
That's nothing to look at.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Pareidolia
is one thing.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids are something
else altogether.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.250 align:middle line:84%
We have right angles,
and that's not a face.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
In 1972, we know that
Mariner 9 photographed

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:84%
what appeared to be pyramids
in the Elysium region on Mars.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes Mariner 9 took these
very high-contrast photographs.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:84%
They were low
resolution, but they

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:90%
were almost black and white.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So any type of geometric
formation you would see

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:90%
would have very stark lines.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Sagan came
publicly and said

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that he found some structures
in these early Mariner 9

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
formations that look
like they're pyramids--

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:90%
three-sided pyramids.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:90%
It got a lot of attention.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting
thing because this

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:90%
was before the face on Mars.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Scientists were taking this idea
of finding structures on Mars

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:90%
very seriously.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Carl Sagan wasn't
the first scientist

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at these
formations on Mars.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman, a scientist,
his name was Mack Gipson.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.800 align:middle line:84%
He had a science paper
published in Icarus magazine.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, Icarus magazine is like
a high-brow science journal.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And he had an article
published in there

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
about these same pyramids
way before Carl Sagan.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was called Pyramidal
Formations on Mars.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And he gave this a real
scientific analysis.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And all this was great until
we had the face on Mars,

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and then all interest in
anything on Mars was ended.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Let's take a look
at two images of the pyramids

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:90%
on Mars from 1972.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Walk us through this.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.660 align:middle line:90%
This is in the Elysium region.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:84%
These are the-- that's the
original data strip that

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.800 align:middle line:84%
came back that Carl
Sagan and Mack Gipson saw

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:84%
these triangular, three-sided--
these are tetrahedral pyramids.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
We're finding a lot of
three-sided pyramids on Mars.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Normally on Earth,
here you have a lot

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
of pyramids that
are all four-sided.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Often, you might find
a five-sided pyramid.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Mars seems to have a lot
of tetrahedral pyramids.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: This is
Carl Sagan's, right?

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, but these
are the new images

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
from the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter CTX camera.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, Carl
Sagan never got

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
to see any high-resolution
pictures of his pyramids

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:84%
at Elysium because
he died in 1976.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And these images were
from the early 2000s.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So he never got
any clarification

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:90%
on what he was looking at.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.916 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What does this
suggest to you at this stage,

00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
this information and data
is coming out in 1972.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Are you considering a
civilization and life on Mars

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:90%
at this point?

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, just as Carl
Sagan and Gipson said,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
that these things
need to be looked at.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:84%
These point towards
artificiality.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.988 align:middle line:90%
Nature does not make geometry.

00:12:46.988 --> 00:12:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking
for artificial structures

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
on another planet, the first
thing, according to Carl Sagan,

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.270 align:middle line:84%
would be look for geometry
because that's the signature

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:90%
of somebody making something.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So we
have the possibility

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:84%
of an existence of a planetary
body between Mars and Jupiter

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that exploded, created a lot of
things here in our star system,

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Would this suggest some of the
artificial elements of Mars?

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, the exploding
planet hypothesis in between

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter and Mars--

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:84%
whatever civilization
was on Mars at that time,

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.170 align:middle line:90%
whenever this blew up.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Tom Van
Flandern, in his book--

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
he talks about this, I
think, in the late 1990s,

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that this probably happened
about 65 million years ago,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:84%
which coincided with the
destruction of the dinosaurs

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of new science
talks about this event

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:84%
that if this actually
happened, which

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.160 align:middle line:84%
created the asteroid
belt-- the asteroid belt

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.210 align:middle line:90%
is in between Mars and Jupiter.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, when this planet
blew up-- of course,

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to teach kids in
school that planets can blow up.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream science says
this asteroid belt was there

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning of our solar
system which makes no sense.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Why would we have an asteroid
belt and all these other rocks

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.463 align:middle line:84%
and things were supposed
to go together and create

00:14:03.463 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:90%
all the planets.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So when this planet blew
up, it destroyed whatever

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:90%
civilization was on Mars.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we can only speculate.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was
a long time ago--

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:90%
probably destroyed.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:84%
All the planets were pushed
in towards the sun because

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:84%
of this explosion, killing
whatever civilization

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:90%
was on Mercury or Venus.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And Earth, we had low
gravity because it

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:90%
was further away from the sun.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's how you had dinosaurs.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:90%
You can't make a dinosaur today.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
If you do a Jurassic Park,
you try to do a brontosaurus

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
or T-- they're not
going to stand up.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:90%
It's just impossible.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:90%
There's too much gravity.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's what killed the
dinosaurs, not the meteor

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:84%
hitting in the Yucatan and
creating this global problem.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:84%
What killed the
dinosaurs is gravity.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't me talking.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:84%
There's scientific
papers talking

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:90%
about this, this whole idea.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a possibility of
what killed the dinosaurs.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:90%
So then time passes.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Earth becomes this
green, beautiful place.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We have Cro-Magnon and
Neanderthals running around.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And some civilization from
outside our solar system

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:84%
comes in here, some
runaway culture,

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.060 align:middle line:84%
they come here to
hide from somebody.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're running
away from Darth Vader.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.443 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Are we talking
about the Anunnaki?

00:15:12.443 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Possibly the Anunnaki,
or some culture like that,

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:90%
that comes to our solar system.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:90%
They find Earth.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a paradise.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:90%
They come here.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:90%
They set up a base.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And whoever they're
hiding from, they set up

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.252 align:middle line:84%
little outposts on
the moon and on Mars

00:15:25.252 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:84%
because they figure
somebody coming

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
in from outside
our solar system,

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:84%
they could defend their
planet with a base on Mars

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:90%
as a gatekeeper.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:90%
So they put one on the moon.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.197 align:middle line:90%
They put one on Mars.

00:15:35.197 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have evidence
from other researchers

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.262 align:middle line:84%
that looks like there's
ruins on the moon,

00:15:39.262 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and we have all the
evidence of all these ruins

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:90%
we're finding on Earth.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.492 align:middle line:84%
So as time passed, they
took the available man,

00:15:45.492 --> 00:15:47.200 align:middle line:84%
the Cro-Magnon,
Neanderthal, or whatever,

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.102 align:middle line:84%
and they made us
as workers, which

00:15:49.102 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:90%
is mentioned in the Anunnaki.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What kind of time
span are we talking about?

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.885 align:middle line:84%
How long ago do you
speculate that--

00:15:54.885 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: This is
about a million--

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:90%
probably a million years ago.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not that long ago.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:04.058 align:middle line:84%
And these timelines, about a
million years ago and 22,000

00:16:04.058 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
years ago kind of coordinate,
which we'll talk about a little

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
later, about the Maya Star Wars,
which is the same time period.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And they build this culture
on Earth and the moon and Mars

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.780 align:middle line:90%
as an outpost.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Whatever culture they
ran away from finds them.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Then there's a war.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:90%
They blow up everything on Mars.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They blow up
everything on the moon,

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and the culture that's
here, they fight it out.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
We have all these myths of
ancient cultures fighting,

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
even in India, the gods
fighting and stuff like this.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:90%
So they lose, and they leave.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.510 align:middle line:90%
They leave Earth.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
They leave it to the humans,
us, who they've made,

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:90%
and we inherit the Earth.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.073 align:middle line:90%
They go to another solar system.

00:16:43.073 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:90%
We don't know where they go.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:90%
We're just speculating.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
They go to a place
far, far away,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're left to set up camp
on Earth because we're here.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Is there any
evidence or data or science

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:90%
into a past war on Mars?

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
a chemical signatures

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:90%
or a technical signature.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Any radiation, any
elements that could

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
be measured on Mars that
would suggest some type of war

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:90%
on the surface?

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, that's an
interesting time frame, again,

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:90%
the million years ago.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:84%
We have-- archaeologists
have this dilemma

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:84%
about this Maya Star War that
happened a million years ago.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And the only place that they
can find records of this

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:84%
is in a little known place
in Mexico called Naranjo.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to the
Maya-- which we can all read

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:90%
the Maya hieroglyphics now.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:84%
They talk about this Star
War between Ticul, Cozumel,

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other
surrounding cities

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.920 align:middle line:84%
next to Naranjo, had this
war with Six Earth Place.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
The Maya counted all of the
planets from the outside

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.580 align:middle line:84%
in, kind of like the Sumerians
did-- another reference

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:90%
to the Anunnaki.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Earth would be the
seventh planet,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Venus would be
eighth, and so on.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Mars would be the sixth planet.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So they have this reference
to an Earth-like place that's

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:90%
number six, which would be Mars.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, the patron God of Naranjo
was the zip monster or the--

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
he was also the symbol for Mars.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have all
this Mars reference

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:90%
to Naranjo and Six Earth Place.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's all this other
textual stuff references

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
in Maya hieroglyphics that
you can find all this conflict

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:90%
between Earth and Mars.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.460 align:middle line:84%
The Dresden Codex highlights
all of the celestial movements

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:90%
of Mars very detailed.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
interested in Mars.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I kind of
catalog all of the events

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and all of the symbolism that
relates to this ancient battle

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:90%
that went on Mars.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And you talked about
a chemical signature.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, Dr. Brandenburg
talks about the Xenon-129.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, going back
to Mariner 9, they

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:84%
had a snifter that sniffed
the atmosphere that

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
was on board the camera, which
most people don't talk about,

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
the spacecraft that
went out there.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
first detected Xenon-129,

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:84%
all the way back
to the Mariner 9.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Which usually only
results from a nuclear weapon--

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:90%
detonation of a nuclear weapon.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
That's a signature for
nuclear explosions.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Right.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: The detractors
will say, well,

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:84%
you can have Xenon 129
detected naturally,

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.785 align:middle line:90%
but it's very, very minute.

00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:26.660 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't find it
way up in the atmosphere

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:84%
like they were--
it was abundant.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So it was way more
than you would expect.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It was also detected
during the Viking missions.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So they had two tests
that showed Xenon-129.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly, the
big hotspots were

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Cydonia and the Utopia area.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And those were the
two target areas

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
we had to land for
the 1976 Viking, which

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:90%
is kind of interesting.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Which is
very interesting

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
because of the idea
behind the pyramid

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.720 align:middle line:84%
seems to be cross-cultural
here on Earth.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Every culture's
built pyramids when

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
they weren't in contact with
each other, too, as well.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:90%
It's an elegant design.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But they are so
similar, aren't they?

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And I want to pull up an
image of the White Pyramid

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
in China, which isn't
talked about much.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But China's got some of the
largest pyramids in the world,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:84%
but they're also very similar
to other structures, too,

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.420 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's pull up that image.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at?

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, this
photograph was taken out

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
of the window from a
pilot during World War II.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.030 align:middle line:84%
He had gone off course, and
he ended up in Xi'an, China.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.200 align:middle line:90%
This picture was taken.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:84%
It was published actually at
the time in the New York Times.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And later on, as time
went on-- because nobody--

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:90%
China doesn't have pyramids.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And this image ended up
in a lot of those books

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.310 align:middle line:84%
about hoaxes and ancient
mysteries and things like that.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was basically dismissed
for a very long time

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:90%
until Google Earth emerged.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think this was around
2003 when Google Earth started

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:84%
having all these images
up on the internet

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:84%
where you could go around the
world and look at everything.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:10%
We found there's dozens
of pyramids in China, just

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:10%
like this White Pyramid.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.653 align:middle line:10%
Now, what China has
done-- this pyramid

00:21:20.653 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:10%
appears to be
covered with granite

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:10%
or some kind of white stone.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:84%
All the stones
have been removed.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And China has covered up
all these dozens and dozens

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:84%
of pyramids with
dirt, and they've

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:90%
planted shrubbery and trees.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
obscured from the sky.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But we see them, and we
know these are pyramids.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, this idea of building
pyramids, the Maya did that.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to mimic mountains.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.633 align:middle line:84%
So that was the whole--
that's why we find pyramids.

00:21:45.633 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
cultures are trying

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.727 align:middle line:84%
to conquer nature and
build man-made mountains.

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why everything is
pyramidal because they're

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:90%
mimicking mountains.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you're looking
at images on Mars

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and seeing these pyramids that
Carl Sagan was looking at,

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:84%
they're mountain-shaped,
but they're too sharp.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, normal mountains,
the conical shape, or they

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:90%
don't have these stark edges.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.010 align:middle line:90%
So this is a problem.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, this scientist in, I
think it was 2014, did a study.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:84%
He invited NASA scientist,
SETI scientist, geologists,

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:84%
archaeologists, anthropologists,
and he put a book out.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And the result was
that science community

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.080 align:middle line:84%
was incapable of
identifying markers

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
for intelligent design
on another planet.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Well,
it's right there.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
There is stuff to be discovered
if you take the time to do it.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:90%
It is rare.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to use the word rare.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:84%
It is rare these
days to discover

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
something new, something
fresh, something

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:90%
that we can sink our teeth into.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
But you've just
done that in what

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:84%
appears to be a parrot
formation there on Mars.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:90%
And I want to go through that.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you found,
and can you tell us about it?

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: This parrot
formation was found back

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:84%
in, I think, 2002 by a member
of the Cydonia Institute,

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Will Faust.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And going through some images of
the Argyre basin area of Mars,

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:84%
next to a huge body of water--
this would have been a port city

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:90%
at the time--

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
he found this profiled
image of a parrot.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, the parrot from the beak to
the tail is about a mile long.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.083 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: It is big.

00:23:27.083 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: And we have
sent these pictures

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.520 align:middle line:84%
to geologists geologist
and veterinarians,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:90%
over five veterinarians.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:84%
They found 22 points of
anatomical correctness.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: 22 points?

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: 22 points.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Explain.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Which points were
they looking at?

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, once you see
the image, it's not pareidolia.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:90%
You can't unsee it.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.458 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of
times with this type

00:23:49.458 --> 00:23:51.373 align:middle line:84%
of digital images,
your human eye

00:23:51.373 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
has to adjust to what
you're looking at.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.248 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been looking
at this stuff for 30 years,

00:23:55.248 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
so I can pick it
up pretty quickly.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But they're talking
about the beak.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:84%
You can actually see the
tongue, the lower jaw, the head,

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:90%
the eye.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.710 align:middle line:90%
He's got a body.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:84%
He's got an elbow that goes
down with claws and feet,

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:90%
and he's got tails.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
One arm is up, the
feathers are up.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:90%
You can see the feather frets.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Very much-- the detail
is unbelievable.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So they found 22 points of
this anatomical correctness.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, earlier we spoke about
seeing tigers and bears

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:90%
and lions up in the clouds.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Any type, even land formations
that look like a bear,

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:84%
turn it to the left where the
rock that looks like a bear--

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I've seen Washington
crossing the Delaware.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So you see a lot of
silhouetted things.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
detail that this has.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is unquestionably--
this is like a smoking gun.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:90%
This is a geoglyph of a parrot.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.053 align:middle line:84%
Now, why is there
a parrot on Mars,

00:24:45.053 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:84%
the audience is
probably saying at home.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, everything we're
finding, going all the way back

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:84%
to the face on Mars, all
has a direct correlation

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
to the cultures of Mesoamerica--
the Olmec, the Maya, the Aztec,

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.153 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:24:56.153 --> 00:24:57.570 align:middle line:84%
The things we're
finding on Mars--

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:58.787 align:middle line:90%
very similar to that.

00:24:58.787 --> 00:25:00.870 align:middle line:84%
It appears like somebody
put these things up there

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:84%
to tell the story of
the Maya Popol Vuh.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: But why a bird deity?

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, the bird
is the principal bird

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.070 align:middle line:90%
deity of the Maya.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:84%
In the Maya Popol Vuh, the
story of their creation,

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the creation gods
made all the animals.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:15.630 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
they made were birds

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:84%
to take care of the
trees and the heavens.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And they made deer to take care
of the foliage and the grass

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.180 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So one of the birds they had
was the principal bird deity,

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:90%
and he was a bad boy.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.750 align:middle line:90%
He was a little mischievous.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:84%
At the time of creation, he soon
stole the sun and hid it away.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.913 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So they
all have a story.

00:25:35.913 --> 00:25:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: So a lot of
these early cultures

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:84%
have stories about hero
twins, and so do the Maya.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, these hero
twins, the two boys,

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
they go out looking for
the principal bird deity

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:90%
because he stole the sun.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.530 align:middle line:84%
They see him sitting up on
top of the world tree, which

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:90%
is at the center of the Earth.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's the
principal bird deity

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:90%
sitting on the top of the tree.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:90%
They get their blow darts out--

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:90%
boom-- him in the jaw.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go back
to the picture--

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.990 align:middle line:84%
the audience wants to take
a look at that-- you'll

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.365 align:middle line:84%
notice there
appears to be a blow

00:26:01.365 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:84%
dart in the parrot's jaw, an
odd feature that the parrot has.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.655 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we're seeing on Mars
is after the hero twins shot

00:26:08.655 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
the parrot, and it fell to
Earth, he's down on the ground

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:90%
dead.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:90%
His one leg is out.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:90%
His other claws up like this.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And we get to see
all the features

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
of that upper claw in the new
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.310 align:middle line:90%
image.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Didn't the
Mayans have a city built

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:90%
after the design of a parrot?

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, some of the
other-- because the Maya,

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
also Peruvian architects,
built a lot of structures that

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:90%
mimicked--

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: There
it is right there.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Right.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:84%
That whole city there is
shaped in the form of a parrot.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And it almost looks
like the parrot on Mars

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:90%
in the silhouette.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.440 align:middle line:90%
It's got the head.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:90%
It's got the wing up--

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:48.160 align:middle line:90%
very interesting.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is built by
the early K'iche' Maya.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the oldest
structures built by the Maya.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is built as
a pictographic image

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:90%
of the principal bird deity.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, the principal bird deity
was also known as Seven Macaw,

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:90%
because it was a macaw parrot.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The reason it was called
Seven Macaw because the parrot

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
also had a celestial part,
and that was the seven stars

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:90%
of the Big Dipper.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So the principal bird deity,
also known as Seven Macaw,

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:84%
its celestial image
was the Big Dipper.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I want to
jump back, if I may.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:26.960 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned an exploding
planet, the Mayans,

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:84%
a possible star
war, if you will,

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and the creation of
us, as well, as humans.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.380 align:middle line:84%
That's a very interesting
way to look at things.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But can you go deeper into this
concept of a Mayan Star War.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't think many
have heard of it?

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: No, it goes back to this
little-known place of Naranjo,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.100 align:middle line:84%
where all-- this is basically
where all this information comes

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:52.900 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a dilemma for the
Maya, or the archaeologists.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
But according to
the hieroglyphics

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.110 align:middle line:84%
written on the monuments and
in their pottery and stuff,

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.960 align:middle line:84%
it talks about this Star
War between Six Earth

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Place and Earth.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, this happened--
the first big battle

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:90%
was a million years ago.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It's 896,000 years ago, which
is almost a million years.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And that correlates with
Dr. Brandenburg's explosion

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:84%
of these nuclear
weapons on Mars.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:84%
He says, according to NASA,
it's about a million years ago,

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:90%
this evidence shows.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.010 align:middle line:84%
The second battle that the star
war incorporated with the Tical

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:33.220 align:middle line:84%
area and Naranjo with Mars
was about 22,000 years ago.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, let's
take a look at this image

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:84%
of these Mayan codes
that would suggest this.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with the Star War.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, the
glyph on the left

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:84%
is a Venus glyph, that
little-- looks like the eyes

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:90%
up there with the number three.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a Venus symbol.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, so the audience knows
I'm not interpreting these.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:84%
This is all
archaeological references.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
This is how the archaeologists
interpret all this.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a Star War.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you see that
glyph in a text,

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.840 align:middle line:90%
that talks about a star war.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, the star wars were
ceremonial with the Maya.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They would have
these rituals where

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:84%
they would have these
make believe-- like we do

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.340 align:middle line:90%
reenactments of the Civil War.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Same idea.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:84%
They would do these
ritualistic battles.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
trigger a Star War.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And on the right
side of the screen,

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.560 align:middle line:84%
the first symbol there in
the front is a bar and a dot.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the Maya
counting system.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:90%
A bar means five.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- they used a bar.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:90%
And the dot is 1.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's 1 and 5 is 6.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And that little acorn head
there, that's an Earth symbol.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So this interprets
as Six Earth place.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a reference,
another reference.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Mars references are the Mars
beast, and also Six Earth Place

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
because it was an
Earth-like place.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Very interesting.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The timing of that war-- let's
stay with this if we can.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:84%
The timing of the
war is interesting

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.350 align:middle line:84%
if we look at a
million years ago,

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and we look at our own
historical references

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:90%
back into that time period.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that there was an
ancient high-tech civilization

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:84%
that came and went here,
and we're still struggling

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.880 align:middle line:90%
to find evidence of it?

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, this is
that breakaway culture

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
earlier that came here

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.870 align:middle line:90%
about a million years ago.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And the human genome goes
back about a million years.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So it all correlates
with the time frame.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Neanderthals and
Cro-Magnons, they

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:84%
were destroyed
once they made us.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.877 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after,
they had the battle

00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:38.210 align:middle line:90%
there about a million years ago.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think the second
battle, the 22,000 years ago,

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.240 align:middle line:84%
was after the humans went to
Mars, and that one happened,

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.230 align:middle line:90%
which was recorded.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, these texts
that we're reading

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:84%
from Naranjo about the Maya,
I'm not saying the Maya

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.590 align:middle line:90%
were on Mars.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:84%
They're recording something
that was told to them.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.187 align:middle line:84%
This is sacred knowledge
that they re-enact.

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:57.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why they have
the reenactments.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.282 align:middle line:84%
When their lords
become king, they

00:30:59.282 --> 00:31:01.240 align:middle line:84%
dress up like the zip
monster, or they dress up

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:84%
like the principal bird
deity or some other gods.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is all part
of the reenactment.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.120 align:middle line:84%
The Aztecs had what they
called flower wars, which

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.310 align:middle line:84%
were reenactments between the
different tribes of the Aztec.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't
kill the enemy.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:90%
They would capture them.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So they had these
make-believe wars,

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.500 align:middle line:84%
like you'd go on a Saturday
afternoon to watch a reenactment

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:84%
of Gettysburg with all of these
reenactment guys that have all

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.060 align:middle line:84%
their outfits that they have
women sew for them and make it

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:31.290 align:middle line:84%
look like they're back in
the Civil War in the 1860s.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The Maya did-- or the
Aztec did the same thing.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't kill the enemy.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:84%
They would capture them and then
use them later for sacrifice

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:90%
to the sun.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But they had this
arrangement, which

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.160 align:middle line:90%
this is what they would do.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So they're all just
reenacting these ancient wars

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:90%
that happened so long ago.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Is it
similar to the stories,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:84%
like in the Epic of Gilgamesh,
and some of the Sumerian texts

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:58.650 align:middle line:84%
that were referencing these
cosmic wars, too, as well

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.980 align:middle line:90%
with the Anunnaki?

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But these are two
cultures that never

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:90%
communicated with each other.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.060 align:middle line:90%
Are they similar?

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.602 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: I think
they're very similar.

00:32:05.602 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And what we have is we have
similar histories being recorded

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.290 align:middle line:84%
by different
cultures, but they're

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:84%
recording it in their sect, in
their creed, in their history.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's a little different.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.360 align:middle line:90%
So the Romans have hero twins.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.640 align:middle line:84%
You find over in Scandinavia,
they have hero twins.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the same idea.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.370 align:middle line:84%
The stories are just
changed a little bit.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think the whole concept of
the Anunnaki, the whole story--

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:35.480 align:middle line:84%
we probably don't know the
whole details of the story

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the
tablets are destroyed,

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.177 align:middle line:90%
or we only have partial stories.

00:32:39.177 --> 00:32:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But what we're getting
out of the Maya

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
is a pretty detailed story about
this conflict, which parallels

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.420 align:middle line:90%
what we had with the Anunnaki.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking it's probably
the same story, probably

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.530 align:middle line:84%
the same story that we see
recorded in India about the gods

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.350 align:middle line:90%
fighting.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Well, what do you
make of a third party coming in,

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.910 align:middle line:84%
like a remote viewer
that's worked with the CIA.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, he's
seeing the same story.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.480 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, I'm glad you
brought that up because I

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.120 align:middle line:90%
had forgotten about that.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.610 align:middle line:84%
That test they did with
the remote viewing,

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.717 align:middle line:84%
they saw this destruction
going on Mars.

00:33:13.717 --> 00:33:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And do you know what time
frame they came up with?

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:90%
A million years ago.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep finding
these detail points

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.150 align:middle line:84%
from different
academic research,

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
it comes to appear that possibly
what we're seeing on Mars

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.700 align:middle line:84%
is more evidence for what
these scientists are telling us

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.290 align:middle line:90%
possibly happened in the past.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: How many
Mayan codexes survived?

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Four?

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yeah, there's
three or four.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Three or four.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish come in and
burn and destroy everything.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:51.350 align:middle line:84%
We are very lucky that we've
got these complete codexes

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:52.150 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But the Madrid Codex is an
interesting one, isn't it?

00:33:55.750 --> 00:34:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it actually goes
straight at Mars and Mars

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.810 align:middle line:84%
beast descending
from the sky, which

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:90%
suggests to me outer space.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, the Mars
images in the Madrid Codex,

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.239 align:middle line:84%
they're very similar to the ones
that are in the Dresden Codex.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
They also-- they
have a star band,

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.050 align:middle line:84%
which is what the
archaeologists call it.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a symbol of the
sky, the stars, the heavens.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.984 align:middle line:84%
And it has these beasts
coming down like an invasion,

00:34:21.984 --> 00:34:23.929 align:middle line:84%
like they're coming
down from the sky,

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're dressed
like Mars beasts.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:90%
So you have a Martian invasion.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.971 align:middle line:84%
It's very-- and this
kind of went right

00:34:30.971 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:84%
over the head of
the archaeologist.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:33.762 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't put this together.

00:34:33.762 --> 00:34:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Well, we
had a difficult time

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.969 align:middle line:84%
transcribing and translating
it, too, as well.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:84%
But once it becomes apparent,
and you have it accurately

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:50.699 align:middle line:84%
read and transcribed, they
were writing about an event.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:52.500 align:middle line:90%
And it was preserved there.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.199 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
when there was

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:55.800 align:middle line:90%
nothing else flying in the sky.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.360 align:middle line:90%
What else were they seeing?

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Yea.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Maya, the Aztec, they
were very much astronomers.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.748 align:middle line:90%
They searched the heavens.

00:35:03.748 --> 00:35:05.540 align:middle line:84%
They watched all the
movements of-- they're

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.760 align:middle line:84%
very interested in
Mars, also, Venus.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of their battles and
stuff were when Venus--

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:84%
See, Venus and Mars can
both be morning stars.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of
archaeologists believe

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:84%
that the morning star was Venus,
but sometimes it could be Mars.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And when these things arose,
this would signify to the Maya

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.480 align:middle line:90%
that we have to have a battle.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to do a reenactment
of these battles that

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.890 align:middle line:84%
happened a long time ago
between Earth and Mars

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
with that weird
culture that was here.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I spend a lot of time
in Central and South America.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I love going down there
and just seeing things

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.160 align:middle line:84%
because your eyes
don't lie to you.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And Chichén Itzá
is very interesting

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:45.670 align:middle line:84%
because we have something
there that clearly shows

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:48.230 align:middle line:90%
a spacecraft and an astronaut.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
something like that,

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:middle line:84%
where they literally just
laying it out for us,

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.320 align:middle line:90%
that is what is going on.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Is there a reason to
second guess or try

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:03.610 align:middle line:84%
to interpret what
is represented?

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well Chichén Itzá
is kind of interesting.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.710 align:middle line:84%
The Temple of the Jaguar
have all these wall murals

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:90%
and these carvings inside.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And back in the early 1900s,
this young woman was allowed

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.570 align:middle line:84%
to go in there and
do watercolors.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:16.565 align:middle line:84%
And she documented
all of these things.

00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And thank God we
have these today

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.400 align:middle line:84%
because you can't basically
see anything in there

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.780 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
deteriorated and flaked off.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And she actually shows
these stargate images

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.355 align:middle line:84%
of these little guys with
beards sitting inside.

00:36:29.355 --> 00:36:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
thing about these murals

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.030 align:middle line:84%
at Chichén Itza in the
Temple of the Jaguar,

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:35.860 align:middle line:90%
it seems to be different races.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.030 align:middle line:90%
You have guys with beards.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Maya do not have beards.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So there seem to
be a melting pot.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.038 align:middle line:84%
Different cultures that
were down in this area.

00:36:43.038 --> 00:36:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the Temple of the
Jaguar, it specifically shows

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.990 align:middle line:84%
battles going on,
celestial battles,

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.810 align:middle line:84%
with these star captains,
or these captain

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.040 align:middle line:84%
suns that the
archaeologists call them.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And they just look
at these, and I

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.020 align:middle line:84%
guess they just can't see that
this looks like a star battle.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.922 align:middle line:84%
And the other image is
like a serpent and a person

00:37:01.922 --> 00:37:02.880 align:middle line:90%
sitting on the serpent.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.047 align:middle line:90%
They're fighting in the sky.

00:37:04.047 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And below it is a
battle going on.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.780 align:middle line:84%
This looks like a major event
going on that they're just

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.845 align:middle line:90%
misinterpreting.

00:37:10.845 --> 00:37:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What do you
make of the star shield

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.680 align:middle line:90%
in Elysium back on Mars.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Oh, right down from
the famous Carl Sagan pyramids.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Yes.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.573 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Carl Sagan's
pyramids, they weren't alone.

00:37:21.573 --> 00:37:25.010 align:middle line:84%
There were other geometrically
shaped structures there.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.650 align:middle line:84%
We had two that I
call the star shields.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:90%
They are five-pointed stars.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.630 align:middle line:84%
They look like star forts that
they built during the Civil War.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's exactly the same shape.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.020 align:middle line:90%
It's bizarre.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Let's look
at an image right here.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.760 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
star shields here.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I could almost say star fort,
now that you mention it.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, I call
them star shields.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.750 align:middle line:90%
They look like star forts.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.380 align:middle line:84%
The one on the left
is the larger one.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.650 align:middle line:84%
That's about, I don't
know, 2,500 across.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this little
one, which I call the mini me

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:84%
or star shield junior, and
they're almost identical.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you
have that in nature?

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.550 align:middle line:90%
These things were constructed.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm showing an
example here of the fort.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:07.670 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Fort Santa Teresa.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:90%
This is in Uruguay.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a star
fort that was built

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.760 align:middle line:84%
around the same
time we were having

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.980 align:middle line:84%
our birth of our
country in 1776.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine that
covered over with sand and dirt,

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and you would think
it's almost identical.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And it even has the
little point at the top.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
thing, if the viewers

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.500 align:middle line:84%
are looking at these
two star forts,

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.520 align:middle line:84%
the peaks have these
little curves to them.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the book, I
show the significance

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:84%
of those little
curves on the points

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.800 align:middle line:84%
is because there's three
sections of structures, that

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:84%
include the Carl Sagan
three-sided pyramids,

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that they're all arranged
in a circular pattern.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When you start to
see these starburst formations

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and star formations, to suggest
that it's not necessarily

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.870 align:middle line:90%
formed in nature.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But I see da Vinci,
too, as well.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.990 align:middle line:84%
He's designed formations
with this shape.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:06.730 align:middle line:84%
This is nothing new here,
but it has never been

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:90%
in nature on Earth either.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.780 align:middle line:84%
It does seem like it's
intelligent design, doesn't it?

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, especially when you
look at this area surrounding

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:18.980 align:middle line:84%
where Carl Sagan's pyramids
are, in these star fort shaped

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.160 align:middle line:84%
star shields that I
call them, everything

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.370 align:middle line:90%
around it looks natural.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:26.370 align:middle line:84%
You can see mountainous
areas and little formations.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.690 align:middle line:90%
None of them jump out at you.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.050 align:middle line:90%
But all of these, it's just--

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.445 align:middle line:90%
it says, hey, looky here.

00:39:31.445 --> 00:39:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: And talking about
starburst, we have Fort Henry.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And we've got an
image here that I want

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.590 align:middle line:90%
you to tell me what's going on.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.923 align:middle line:90%
This is very compelling.

00:39:41.923 --> 00:39:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, what
we're looking at here,

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.520 align:middle line:90%
this is in a different area of--

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.840 align:middle line:90%
it's not in Elysium.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.830 align:middle line:90%
This is in another area of Mars.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And this shows a five-sided
star fort formation.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing about
this, when I first found it,

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I really wasn't
aware of Fort Henry.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.513 align:middle line:84%
I knew about Fort Henry,
but I didn't really

00:40:00.513 --> 00:40:02.610 align:middle line:84%
know what its
footprint looked like.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at this
star image on Mars,

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:10.830 align:middle line:84%
which I call a starburst, it has
that flat portion on the top.

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And it also has these
little mounds inside.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, these mounds inside
are where the barracks are

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and the armory and
all this stuff.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And we find the same
thing with Fort Henry.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Has the same shape, has the
five bastions that stick out.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:23.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very defensive.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And it also has that odd flat
top on the top northern area.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You can
almost overlay those.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: It is mind-boggling.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.553 align:middle line:90%
It's like it's a doppelganger.

00:40:33.553 --> 00:40:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, in the same
region we have a Pentagon, too,

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.200 align:middle line:90%
don't we?

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, just like we have
the D&M Pyramid in Cydonia,

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
there's a five-sided
pyramid right down from this

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:90%
that-- it's very geometric.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, like Carl
Sagan says, you want

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to look for geometry
because that's

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.457 align:middle line:90%
the signature for architecture.

00:40:52.457 --> 00:40:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When we talk
about ancient civilizations

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and these possibilities, I
like to go into the A word, not

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.720 align:middle line:90%
aliens, but Atlantis.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.080 align:middle line:90%
What have you discovered?

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And NASA has brought
up Atlantis Chaos?

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Yes, this
interesting area of Mars NASA

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.320 align:middle line:84%
calls Atlantis Chaos, Chaos
meaning that it's in disarray.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:84%
It's chaotic, maybe
what you would

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.657 align:middle line:84%
see after a nuclear
explosion-- total chaos.

00:41:19.657 --> 00:41:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
finding on Mars.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.685 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Let's
look at this image.

00:41:23.685 --> 00:41:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Now, what we
have here is a close-up.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.140 align:middle line:84%
This is from the Mars Global
Reconnaissance Orbiter camera.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the best
camera that NASA has.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:31.770 align:middle line:84%
We're zooming in
on the landscape.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
is this grid, this

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.740 align:middle line:84%
compartmentalized cubic
structures all in a row.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that
all of these roofs

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:43.470 align:middle line:84%
have been just blown
off of these structures.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I want to make sure
I'm understanding you correctly.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.240 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that
the image on the left

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.708 align:middle line:90%
is a NASA image of Mars.

00:41:52.708 --> 00:41:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: It's hard to
believe, but that's on Mars.

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Let me say it again.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.040 align:middle line:84%
You are saying that
the image on the left

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:90%
is a NASA image of Mars.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Correct.

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.930 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to believe, but
that is found on Mars.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:06.240 align:middle line:90%
It has-- it's totally geometric.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a grid.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It's got these little cubic
dwellings that are there.

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:12.142 align:middle line:90%
They're all empty.

00:42:12.142 --> 00:42:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
similar to what we

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.540 align:middle line:84%
see in Saudi Arabia, these
little adobe-type buildings that

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.390 align:middle line:84%
have the roofs off because these
are very-- nobody lives in these

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.750 align:middle line:84%
They're out in the desert, and
they make great photographs.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see,
this grid-like pattern

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:27.938 align:middle line:84%
is repeated in what
we're seeing on Mars.

00:42:27.938 --> 00:42:29.438 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: That
doesn't look natural.

00:42:29.438 --> 00:42:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: Does not look natural.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And these little dwellings are
about 20 feet by 20 feet square.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:90%
So they're pretty big.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.580 align:middle line:84%
They're probably
as big as a barn.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And these structures
on Earth are

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.690 align:middle line:84%
a lot smaller, these
little dwellings,

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.087 align:middle line:90%
and they're all side by side.

00:42:43.087 --> 00:42:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're looking
at the stuff on Mars,

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.870 align:middle line:84%
not having this comparison that
you can do on Earth, you'd say,

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.810 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is probably just
a geology, but it isn't.

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a close-up.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:56.320 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the same
area showing the peaked roofs.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.208 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Gabled.

00:42:57.208 --> 00:42:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HAAS: The gabled roofs.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.270 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing a comparison
here with Machu Picchu

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.740 align:middle line:84%
with these same similar
dwellings with the roofs.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.290 align:middle line:84%
They probably had straw or
whatever type of coverings

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.090 align:middle line:90%
were on these.

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:07.960 align:middle line:90%
These are all gone.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But the ones on
Mars, you can even

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.740 align:middle line:90%
see debris and things inside--

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.180 align:middle line:90%
very highly detailed.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And this stuff screams
for artificiality.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: One more quick image.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.052 align:middle line:84%
This is the Atlantis
Chaos city center.

00:43:20.052 --> 00:43:21.010 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at?

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, it's
amazing that we

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:24.510 align:middle line:84%
are looking at the close UPS
of all these cubic buildings

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.690 align:middle line:84%
that all the roofs blown off,
if we had a nuclear explosion

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:29.250 align:middle line:90%
that Dr. Brandenburg talks of.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, these three
structures all are intact.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.080 align:middle line:84%
We have a structure
in the center that

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.220 align:middle line:90%
has a dome with a peak on top.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.540 align:middle line:84%
On the left, number A, you
have almost like a step

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.720 align:middle line:90%
pyramid from the Maya.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a twisted temple.

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:43.870 align:middle line:90%
It's all intact.

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.388 align:middle line:84%
And then on the far right,
we have a odd structure

00:43:46.388 --> 00:43:48.180 align:middle line:84%
that looks like an old
wood mill that you'd

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:90%
see up in Northern Maine.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
intact, which is odd.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you had a nuclear
explosion above ground,

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.952 align:middle line:84%
like we had at Hiroshima,
and you remember,

00:43:57.952 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:84%
their public building in
the center was still intact.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.243 align:middle line:10%
Everything else around
that building in the middle

00:44:02.243 --> 00:44:03.070 align:middle line:10%
was destroyed.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:05.850 align:middle line:10%
We have the same imagery here
that we're seeing on Mars.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:09.690 align:middle line:10%
Three structures at the center,
ground zero, still standing,

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:11.193 align:middle line:10%
but everything
else is flattened.

00:44:11.193 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Fascinating.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So much to still be
discovered-- so much.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Where can everybody
find your book?

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HAAS: Well, the book's
put out by Bear & Company.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.680 align:middle line:10%
It's available on their website.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.160 align:middle line:10%
It's also-- everybody
goes to amazon.com.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.840 align:middle line:90%
It's easily found there.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Just look up The Great
Architects of Mars, George Haas,

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:33.500 align:middle line:90%
and my book's right there.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I also suggest, if you're
interested in this information,

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:37.830 align:middle line:90%
also get the Kindle.

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Because the Kindle,
you can zoom in

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.870 align:middle line:84%
because it uses all the digital
images that I got from NASA,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:43.980 align:middle line:90%
that high resolution.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So you can zoom in on
all of these formations

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.360 align:middle line:90%
with the Kindle, which is--

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.290 align:middle line:90%
I recommend get both.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Fascinating
conversation, George.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show today

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Jimmy Church,
sitting in for George Noory.

We'll catch you next time
right here on Beyond Belief.
