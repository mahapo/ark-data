is a very simple method

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:10%
of accessing the
subconscious mind

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:10%

>>NOORY: Bill, what is
the subconscious mind?

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, the
subconscious mind

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
is actually something that is
not really well understood,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:90%
at least in the past.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is a system
that we have within us

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:90%
that controls our lives.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that is
going on in our lives

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
actually is part of
the subconscious.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we all
have the subconscious?

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Everybody
has the subconscious.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who discovered it?

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So it's not actually
the discoverer but the person

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:90%
who coined the term.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Sigmund Freud had coined
the term "the subconscious."

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And the way he described it
is the impulses that we have,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
the associations,
the reactions--

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
that were not

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.735 align:middle line:84%
accessible by the
conscious mind.

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
it lie in the body?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Is it in our brain?

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well that's a really
interesting question, right?

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I've heard
about the subconscious--

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:90%
where is it?

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.835 align:middle line:90%
It seemed quite nebulous.

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody ever tell
you where it was?

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nope.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't think anybody knows.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Nobody
knows, until today.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:90%
So what it is--

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
it's actually our
nervous system.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Our nervous system's our
brain and all our spine

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and the periphery nerves
throughout our body

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:90%
and all the way to our senses.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
It is how we interpret
life, and it stores

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.280 align:middle line:90%
information about every event.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
It's electrical charges that run
all the way through our body.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
access it, Bill?

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:90%
How easy is it?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Or how difficult is it?

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So accessing the
subconscious now, today--

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you a
method, everybody out there--

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
a method of directly
accessing the subconscious.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that it's
actually the nervous system,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
we can actually isolate
the subconscious,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system,
the particular circuit,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.115 align:middle line:90%
actually through the teeth.

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through the teeth?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Through the teeth.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to see
vivid memories, things

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.287 align:middle line:90%
that you have forgot about.

00:03:37.287 --> 00:03:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it
so important, Bill,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:90%
to access the subconscious mind?

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It's really important
to access the subconscious

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
because it controls
all the things that

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:90%
are going on in our lives.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
When we access the
subconscious, we

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:84%
see what has limited us in
some way, shape, or form.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And we can find a way to
have the life of our dreams

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:84%
by understanding what
limited us in the past.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, your partner
at the Cognomovement

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
explains how our central nervous
system is essential to building

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.347 align:middle line:90%
in this security system.

00:04:19.347 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:10%
>>LIZ LARSON: What most
people don't realize

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:10%
is that we are built with
our own security system.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Bill and I like to call it
a threat assessment system.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system, led
by the limbic system,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:84%
is constantly assessing threats,
whether we're safe or not safe.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
This is happening
without our awareness

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:84%
all the time, 24 hours a
day, even into our sleep.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that this
system isn't great at time.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really know if
a threat is happening now,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
from our dreams
and not even real,

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
from our past, our long distant
past, or even our future.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So the issue is that it will
be detecting a threat based

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:90%
on sensation in our body.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Does the body sense something
that reminds it of a fear

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:90%
from long ago, a threat?

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And if so, it'll start a pattern
based on that sensation that

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
sends a signal directly to
the logical mind, the brain,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
that assesses, what
do we do about this?

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Do we raise our blood pressure?

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Do we increase our cortisol
and adrenal levels?

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Do we send a signal back to
the body to be prepared to run?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
This causes a situation where
we have patterns and programs

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and threats throughout
our whole life that

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.995 align:middle line:84%
are running nonstop in the
body and consuming our energy.

00:05:57.995 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill,
that's Liz Larson,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:84%
your partner in Cognomovement,
and she seems to be spot on.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:84%
How does the
subconscious control

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:90%
our destiny and our lives?

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You know,
this is so important.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand this, a
whole world will open up to it.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
The way it works
is our subconscious

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.900 align:middle line:90%
is our nervous system.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious exploits
this and creates a feeling.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:10%
So there's a doctor,
Antonio Damasio,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:10%
and he's originally from
Brazil, but he's a professor,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:10%
I believe, at USC.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And he's a neurologist
and a psychologist.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:84%
He was able to figure out that
we get a feeling in our body.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
This is our nervous
system causing a feeling.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we will think a
thought equal to that feeling.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:84%
What happens for
all of us is we then

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:90%
act according to the feeling.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So the thing that's kind of
great and disturbing about this

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
is that when we get
the feeling, it doesn't

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:90%
matter what the truth is.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what's
good for us or bad for us.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:84%
We will act according
to the feeling.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, people-- whether
they are heads of state,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.742 align:middle line:84%
heads of government,
right down to our family--

00:07:26.742 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Corporations--

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Corporations--

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.933 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --whatever.

00:07:28.933 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --whatever-- what
happens is they're just humans,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
they get a feeling, and then
they will pretzel logic things

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it our gut?

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well a lot of
people experience that.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's actually part of this
subconscious or nervous system.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:90%
They get a feeling.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
They get, oh, I
got a gut feeling.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And now, whatever
that gut feeling is,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:90%
they will act according to it.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So this simple method that the
body has to direct our lives

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:84%
is how the subconscious ends
up controlling everything,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.365 align:middle line:90%
whether we like it or not.

00:08:13.365 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people, Bill, though,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:84%
don't act on their
subconscious mind?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:84%
They have this feeling,
this gut feeling

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
that you just mentioned,
but they don't act on it.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And then it's one of those,
should've, could've, would've

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:90%
situations.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, lots of people
have that experience.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of other people

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:84%
that have the
opposite experience.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, all of us are at
the behest of the subconscious.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:84%
We have all of these
feelings that, in our body,

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
end up forcing us to, let's
say, eat the french fries,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:84%
drink the Coca-Cola, or
become enormously successful,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:90%
a tremendous athlete--

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.010 align:middle line:90%
all of it is, I got a feeling.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The hunch.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, well,
it's actually every feeling

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.660 align:middle line:90%
is all the subconscious.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are some people
better at it than others?

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Some people
are simply more in tune

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:84%
They're aware of their
feelings in their body.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Because this is so
subtle, most of us

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:84%
don't even realize that
we have the feeling

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:90%
and that it came first.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
For most of us, we
wake up in the morning,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:90%
and we may have a feeling.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And what ends up
happening is we will

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
try to hook it into
something, some other thing.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel good
today, and why?

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Why don't I feel good?

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Ah, it's because of them.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Blame it
on something else.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.163 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Blame it
on something else.

00:09:53.163 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's really just
the subconscious

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.243 align:middle line:84%
creating a sensation
in the body.

00:09:57.243 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
we know that we've

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:90%
tapped into our subconscious?

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:90%
How do we get that feeling?

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: There's numerous
ways to know how you've

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:90%
tapped into your subconscious.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
If you really pay
close attention,

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:84%
there is a feeling
in the body where,

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
let's say, when we have a
really great experience,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:84%
where we got exactly
what we wanted--

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.857 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like interviewing
you on this program,

00:10:27.857 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a great feeling, right?

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is like a core
attracting feeling.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious is
creating that feeling.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
But it also creates
these opposite feelings,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
like fear, doubt,
worry, anxiety.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
negative feelings?

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So these
feelings, right--

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
we interpret as
negative or positive.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's really just our
nervous system sending a signal.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are what
we would call corrupt.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
They are a fearful
feeling, but it's not

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.662 align:middle line:90%
based in actual reality.

00:11:09.662 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there certain--
you mentioned the teeth,

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:90%
and you mentioned other areas.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Certain areas of the
body do certain things

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
with the subconscious mind?

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So everywhere in
your body, right, there is--

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.080 align:middle line:90%
the subconscious is running.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Constantly.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we've
been able to do is

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:84%
to isolate an individual
circuit of the subconscious

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:90%
because it is the neurology--

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --and we can
take and look at-- let's say

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I've got a real feeling
in my solar plexus.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right here.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, and it's a
nervous feeling or whatever.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
We can isolate the
individual circuit that's--

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:84%
with the tooth, and we can take
a look and see what's there,

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:84%
the vivid memory or event
that ends up causing this.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the subconscious
mind good or bad for us?

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It's neither
really good or bad.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:84%
It's really trying to
constantly protect us.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly trying
to help us to survive.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a fight-or-flight
mechanism within our system?

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Exactly,
it's a fight-or-flight,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:84%
but it also can be the driver
to become a billionaire.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:84%
It could be the driver to
be a tremendous athlete.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:90%
It's all controlled.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think that the
subconscious-- oh, yeah, it's

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
keeping me suppressed
or whatever.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:90%
But it's not really true.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:84%
It is trying to keep
you alive and well,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's doing its
best job at that.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, those
signals are what

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:90%
we would call nonresourceful.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:84%
There's other times that
they are resourceful.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, let's
go back to Liz Larson

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:84%
again as she relates
memories in our body

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.085 align:middle line:84%
to corrupt files in a
computer-type system.

00:13:12.085 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:10%
>>LARSON: What most
of us are not aware

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:10%
of is that our
memories are actually

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:10%
like corrupt files in
a computer program.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
You see, memories are
inaccurate from the moment

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:90%
they're recorded in the body.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Because they're recorded
from one perspective, yours.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And that perspective
is influenced

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:84%
by everything going on around
a body that the body can sense.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, the weather outside
could affect your memory.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:84%
If it was raining and cold, the
body perceives raining and cold

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and mixes it with whatever the
situation is that happened.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So now that memory is
infiltrated by rainy and cold.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:84%
The next time you run
that memory from the brain

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to the body and the
body to the brain

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.920 align:middle line:84%
through sensation along
the nervous system,

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
that memory will also
take into account whatever

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:90%
else is going on that day.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
If maybe your blood sugar
is low or your clothes

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
are uncomfortable, it'll get
recorded in that memory again.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So if a memory happened
when you were a small child,

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:84%
by the time you're an
adult, maybe 40s or 50s,

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that memory has been
played thousands of times

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and incorporates many
things that don't actually

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:90%
pertain to that memory.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So when we do a
Cognomovement session--

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:84%
we actually access the part of
the brain that knows precisely

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:90%
what happened in that moment--

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
many people are
shocked to find out

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
that the thing they
remember didn't

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.830 align:middle line:84%
happen the way they
remember it, or maybe it

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:90%
didn't happen at all.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating
thing, and it's so useful

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.490 align:middle line:84%
when we realize this,
that memories are simply

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.480 align:middle line:84%
a marker in time but not
necessarily accurate.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to be
discovered in what really

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:90%
did happen in that moment.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And for many people, that
alone can clear things

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:84%
like trauma, pain,
fear, and also can

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
be released in order to return
that energy that the body is

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
utilizing to record that
and count it as a threat.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It can be moved
back into the body

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:84%
to create super
energy for things

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:38.267 align:middle line:84%
like healing and learning
and laughing and loving.

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She knows what
she's talking about, Bill.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: She sure does.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
the brain to all of this?

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Ah, it's
tremendously important.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:84%
It is all a part of
this nervous system.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.231 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the
central part of it?

00:15:54.231 --> 00:15:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It is equally
as important as the body.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.362 align:middle line:90%
It's all one system.

00:16:01.362 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you access
certain parts of the brain

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:90%
to do certain things?

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.798 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So it's
super interesting.

00:16:07.798 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which you'll teach us?

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
This is a real basic
piece of understanding,

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and that is that every single
eye position, actually,

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.240 align:middle line:84%
as you rotate your
eyes around, is

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:90%
a different part of the brain.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:84%
When I'm looking
over here, there's

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
a different part of
the brain stimulated.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Looking over here,
it's a different part

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:90%
of the brain stimulated.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So the combination
of an eye position

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and isolating a
circuit with the teeth,

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.810 align:middle line:84%
you'll end up having a very
clear picture of information

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:90%
that was hidden from you.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Los Angeles, I
was in the middle of a DUI

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
checkpoint, and they
were pulling people

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:90%
over, testing them and stuff.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.498 align:middle line:84%
And they got to
me, and they said,

00:16:57.498 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:90%
have you been drinking tonight?

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.650 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, sir, I haven't.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I need
to do an eye test on you.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And he made me
look at his finger

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:84%
as he moved it back and forth
without moving my head, merely

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:90%
my eyes.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:90%
What was he doing?

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: He's testing to
see what kind of eye movements

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:90%
that you can do.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certain indications

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
in your eye and the
way it behaves--

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.930 align:middle line:84%
you can tell if you've
been drinking or not.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Can you track?

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.773 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's--

00:17:34.773 --> 00:17:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
passed, and off I went,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.870 align:middle line:84%
but he did not want me
moving my head like that.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just my eyes.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a
little bit of how

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:84%
you can tap into your
subconscious mind,

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:90%
almost the same way?

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, it is.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes will indicate
to you where, let's say,

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:90%
for example, an issue is.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:90%
There's a method to it.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.585 align:middle line:84%
You can actually see
the part of the brain--

00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --through the
eyes, because the eyes

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and the brain and
the spinal cord

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:90%
are one neurological system.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kicks up
the subconscious mind?

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it automatic, or do we do it?

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It is,
in fact, automatic.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew it.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: (LAUGHING)
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the wonderful
thing about it,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's the insidious
thing about it, right?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.430 align:middle line:84%
The wonderful thing about
it is it's automatic.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to think
about turning the steering

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.135 align:middle line:90%
wheel in my car or--

00:18:38.135 --> 00:18:39.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just do it.

00:18:39.135 --> 00:18:40.468 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: --avoiding something.

00:18:40.468 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:90%
You simply just do it.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's your reaction.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
you're reacting.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's also, on
the other side,

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
there are certain things
that are nonresourceful.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I had a woman that she was
living in on the Baltic Sea.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in Germany.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And she could not help it but
wolfed down french fries, so

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:90%
many french fries.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.892 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like she was starving?

00:19:04.892 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Like starving,
like, all the time,

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:84%
couldn't get enough
french fries in her diet,

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and the weight, and
then the cholesterol,

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:84%
all the things that
ensue from that.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
It ended up with me, and we
ended up doing the process,

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and we ended up
seeing what caused it.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.043 align:middle line:90%
And it was so amazing.

00:19:27.043 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you found that?

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: We found it.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, when
she was just a child,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:84%
her and her father would go down
to a pier on the Baltic Sea.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:84%
There was a stand there
that sold french fries.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And he-- father would
get her french fries.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.690 align:middle line:84%
It was just the father
and the daughter.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.982 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It made her feel good.

00:19:47.982 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: And she felt so good.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And now, in her adult life,
when she wants to feel good,

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:84%
she didn't realize,
I don't feel good.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a job I hate.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I got problems.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:90%
French fries.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.427 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
make me feel good.

00:20:01.427 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of my
daughters brings up

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of thing
you just mentioned,

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Bill, where we did
kid things as a kid

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.040 align:middle line:90%
when she was a little baby.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
She remembers these
things, and she likes

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:90%
to recreate it as an adult--

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:84%
in an adult way, of course,
but it probably brings back

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:90%
great, little memories for her.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, what it does
is, if you notice, right--

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:84%
let's say for all of
us that are watching,

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
there is a place in
your body that maybe you

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:90%
don't feel so good today.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:90%
You know, there's a--

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:84%
wherever in your body, you
have a little sensation.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But there's a completely
different place in her body

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.402 align:middle line:90%
that she feels this wonderful--

00:20:42.402 --> 00:20:43.568 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you feel good.

00:20:43.568 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --feeling of
feeling good with you.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And if she does the
action, it brings her

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.110 align:middle line:84%
into this place
of feeling great.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of
the most remarkable things

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious mind
can do, in your opinion?

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: In my opinion,
it is absolutely-- well,

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:84%
it is that it controls
95% of whatever

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:84%
is going on in our life, and
only 5% of it's conscious.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So the amazing thing, the
most amazing thing about it,

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:90%
is it's handling every process.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Every detail of our life is
handled by the subconscious.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Only a small portion is
what we're conscious of.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So when we program
it appropriately

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.920 align:middle line:84%
and take control of it,
people can run ultramarathons.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:90%
They can become billionaires.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:84%
They can become not
only highly educated,

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
but they can have
great relationships.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It can make someone
financially successful?

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's kind of crazy that
it can do that, but it's true.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of
Sir Richard Branson.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:02.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, Sir Richard Branson
started 400 companies.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: 400.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's known for his
airline, Virgin Galactic,

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.152 align:middle line:90%
and a few other things.

00:22:08.152 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Many,
many other things.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:90%
There's Virgin everything.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But he has naturally figured
out how to use his subconscious.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And the way he does
it is so simple.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:10%
What he does is he gets a
proposal for a business,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:10%
or he's thinking about
starting a business.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said what he does
is he reads the proposal

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:84%
or thinks about, OK,
should I do this?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And then he stops, and he waits.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And he waits for
a specific feeling

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:90%
in a specific part of his body.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And if the feeling
comes, he moves forward.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So he knows, inherently, knew
how to use his subconscious.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We started a business
several years ago called

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:84%
ParanormalDate.com,
and it started

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:84%
when a lady came up to me at
an event I was speaking at

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:90%
and said, you have to help me.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.870 align:middle line:90%
And I went, excuse me?

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:90%
She said, you need to help me.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's wrong?

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:84%
She said, I went on
a date with a guy

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and started talking about the
paranormal and UFOs and Bigfoot

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and ghosts, things I
really love to talk about.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:90%
He got up and left.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:84%
You need to set up some way
that we can meet people who

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.830 align:middle line:90%
understand what we're doing.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And I went-- this light
hit my subconscious mind.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm going to create
a dating service for people

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:46.230 align:middle line:84%
like her, and it's
been very successful.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Wow.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So what did that feel
like to you, George,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:90%
when you got that information--

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It still feels great.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Every time I see those numbers
grow with the membership--

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:90%
we're up to 159,000 people--

00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Wow.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --who have
signed up for this.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Some have gotten married.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Some have met.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That is really great.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:90%
So where is that sensation?

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
If you were to say, I see
those numbers going up,

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and when you got the
proposal to do this,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:90%
where did you feel something?

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here, in the heart.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Perfect.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So, just like Sir
Richard Branson,

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:84%
now you know, next time
you get that exact feeling

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.170 align:middle line:84%
in that exact place,
you know to go for it.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now it would
not have happened to

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.410 align:middle line:90%
me had she not come up to me.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it would
have dawned on me.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.635 align:middle line:84%
But something clicked,
and I grabbed it.

00:24:41.635 --> 00:24:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That is awesome.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.843 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the thing.

00:24:43.843 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious
mind-- how do you

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.430 align:middle line:84%
improve things with
the subconscious mind,

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.950 align:middle line:84%
like a relationship or
something like that?

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: This is a
really interesting thing

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
is that all of us have our
subconscious programmed.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And the subconscious programming
takes place very early in life.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The Jesuits said,
give me a child

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
between the ages
of zero and seven,

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and I will show you the man.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:18.180 align:middle line:84%
What they knew is they were
programming the subconscious.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So whatever that they programmed
in will repeat forever.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the people that are in our
lives between zero and seven

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.290 align:middle line:90%
are our parents.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes, those
cycles of whatever

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.470 align:middle line:84%
we heard and saw during
that early part of life

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:90%
will continue.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:84%
There is a simple method
where you allow yourself

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:90%
to feel however you feel--

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:84%
let's say I've got a
hard relationship--

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and then you do this
process of reprogramming

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:90%
your subconscious.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
effect, like what we

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.380 align:middle line:84%
call spooky action at a
distance, like Einstein said.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:90%
When I change, they change.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So as this feeling goes away in
me, that relationship changes.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far
does the subconscious

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:90%
work from the body?

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Does it have to be
attached to the body,

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.350 align:middle line:84%
or can it just be out
there, floating around,

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:90%
doing what it does?

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's really neat.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.802 align:middle line:84%
So, George, have you ever had
somebody creep up behind you,

00:26:22.802 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and you felt them,
and you turned around?

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah, all the time.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is your
electromagnetic system, right?

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Our actual nervous system
extends beyond the body.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, as it extends
beyond the body--

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:84%
this extension is
super interesting.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:90%
It helps to keep us safe.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have it, the
person would touch you,

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't even know
it was happening before.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Having said that,
there's a astronaut who

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.867 align:middle line:90%
passed away, Edgar Mitchell.

00:26:59.867 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember him?

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember
Edgar quite well.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.798 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, he was--

00:27:02.798 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Apollo 14,
walked on the moon,

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:84%
set up Noetic Institute, and
loved parapsychology, loved it.

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: He was
an amazing man.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 2000s, he
worked with a bunch

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
of doctors that were doing
MRI research in Germany.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And as they were
taking these MRI scans,

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:34.180 align:middle line:84%
they saw a actual expulsion
of energy out of the person

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:84%
when they were in
emotional state.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And they could--
literally caught it on the MRI.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.350 align:middle line:90%
So the field around you is that.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:90%
But it gets more beyond belief.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So back right before
Edgar died, he

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:84%
had done his very
last interview.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And in his very last
interview-- and you

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
know how Edgar was
so matter-of-fact.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.967 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, he
was, and direct.

00:28:01.967 --> 00:28:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Direct matter--

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.133 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lived in Florida.

00:28:04.133 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
just matter-of-fact.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, we
now have technology

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:90%
to actually read your field.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's
gone on in your life--

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --we can read it
now with this technology.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.540 align:middle line:84%
We can tell, oh, you
were 14 years old.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.620 align:middle line:90%
You fell off your bike.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:84%
You broke your arm, and
you skinned your knee.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:90%
And this was amazing.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had to rewatch
this several times because I

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:84%
was like, oh my god, I
can't believe he's actually

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.250 align:middle line:90%
telling us about this.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, interview
was taken down,

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.140 align:middle line:84%
but that was a gift
that he gave us.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was one of a kind.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Sure was.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Liz Larson
details the success

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.466 align:middle line:84%
of a client undergoing
cognotherapy.

00:28:49.466 --> 00:28:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: A body
under stress consumes

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:90%
large amounts of energy.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:29:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It reroutes that energy to
the muscles to prepare to run,

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:84%
to the adrenal
glands to increase

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:84%
adrenaline and
cortisol, to the heart

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:84%
to create a raise
in blood pressure,

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.850 align:middle line:84%
so there's more blood
moving to muscles

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:90%
that are preparing to run.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It reroutes energy
away from the parts

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that
are responsible

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:90%
for critical thinking, logic.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It reroutes energy away
from the body for healing.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:84%
It is not involved in having
us actively be in love.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have energy for that.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:84%
We're certainly not learning
when a body is under stress.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to see
what did it look

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.010 align:middle line:84%
like inside the brain with
a body that's actively

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.920 align:middle line:90%
under stress.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.520 align:middle line:10%
The images of the brain
scan that you see here

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.120 align:middle line:10%
are exactly that.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.600 align:middle line:10%
It's a brain under stress.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:10%
What we knew about
the subject is

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:10%
that she had an ongoing
family issue from her past.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.140 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't even something
that was active now.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:09.070 align:middle line:10%
It was creating a tremor in
her physical body as well.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:10%
The symptoms were outwardly
present in her body.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:10%
During this test,
this brain scan,

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.040 align:middle line:10%
there were auditory stimulus
and visual stimulus.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:10%
And she was asked to
do cognitive tests.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:10%
They were testing for time
and accuracy and efficiency.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:10%
And in the first image,
you can see that brain

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.250 align:middle line:10%
trying to make
critical decisions

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:10%
but using a massive
amount of energy to do it.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:43.740 align:middle line:10%
The signals were
scrambled and complicated.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:10%
After a Cognomovement
session of just 45 minutes,

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:10%
you see in the second
image that the brain

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:10%
is making much more
efficient decisions

00:30:54.580 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:10%
and utilizing a tremendous
amount less of energy.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:10%
What the test shows-- that
this person was 30% faster,

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:10%
their cognition was
also 30% better,

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:10%
and they were far,
far more efficient.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:12.550 align:middle line:84%
What's important to
us about these brain

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.670 align:middle line:84%
scan results is that we could
see that the body was using

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:90%
energy far more efficiently.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Now this body could
be doing these tests

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and also sending energy to the
brain for critical thinking.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:84%
It could also send energy
to the body for healing.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.040 align:middle line:84%
It could also have enough
energy for the body

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:84%
to feel love or
happiness or joy.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Overall, what we know is that
the system is far, far more

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.290 align:middle line:84%
efficient all the way around
and that it got its energy back

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:84%
for use on things that were
far more important than stress

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.575 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:31:53.575 --> 00:31:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.350 align:middle line:84%
How can we utilize the
subconscious mind, Bill,

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.050 align:middle line:84%
to do positive things
like she's mentioned?

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, the
way we can utilize

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.960 align:middle line:84%
it to do the most positive
things that you mention

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:11.030 align:middle line:84%
is to find the issue
and then to actually

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:84%
go through physical movements
and process the issues.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, I love the
statement from Rumi.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:26.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, seek not to love but
to remove the blocks to it.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And all of the fears and doubts
and worries and concerns,

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:84%
you can actually process so
you don't feel them anymore.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Reprogram the
subconscious to do that,

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and also to program it
in whatever you want.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, this could be
like Sir Richard

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Branson knowing that feeling.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It could be people like
Formula One drivers

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:84%
having super performance
as far as response time

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and making correct decisions.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When Steve Jobs
came up with Apple Computer

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:06.390 align:middle line:84%
with Steve Wozniak,
I'm sure they

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:84%
tapped into something in
their subconscious mind

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:90%
to develop that.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, you bet.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:90%
You bet.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.460 align:middle line:84%
You know that there was
a particular ashram.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:24.250 align:middle line:84%
He ended up in India that
was before it happened.

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happens that
all the other major tech

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.250 align:middle line:84%
heads went to that
same ashram as well.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe it
tuned him up, huh?

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.583 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yeah.

00:33:33.583 --> 00:33:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The practical ways to
access your subconscious-- what

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.650 align:middle line:90%
are some of the easier ways?

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Or does it just kick
in automatically?

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well,
it is automatic.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So one of the really
easy, practical ways

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:84%
to access your subconscious is
to understand the actual body's

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:90%
sensations, wherever they are.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
you and having

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:08.510 align:middle line:84%
that feeling in your heart about
the dating app for people--

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:14.320 align:middle line:84%
now, that is a very clear way
that you can now understand,

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
it's going to go well
if I get this feeling.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other side of things
is to do the same measurement

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:84%
with these other
sensations in the body.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is a natural way that
somebody can start right today,

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.330 align:middle line:90%
utilizing it.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it works.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely, it works.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.690 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is, is
that some of these things

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.690 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely corrupt
and not in our best

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:41.620 align:middle line:90%
and highest interest.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And we will pretzel
logic it around

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, it
is in my interest.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I should not go
meet that person.

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the most
beautiful woman or man

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:54.710 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever seen.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:55.877 align:middle line:90%
You're like, no, no, no, no.

00:34:55.877 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:90%
I can't go up to them.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:84%
They're too good-looking
or whatever it might be.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.240 align:middle line:84%
That might not be
in your interest,

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.920 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's a
business opportunity.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you can actually
be neutral of those anxiety

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:14.470 align:middle line:84%
feelings, you can make decisions
that are more whole brain,

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.650 align:middle line:84%
because as we're in
fear, it literally

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:84%
shuts down the brain
and the parts of it

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.050 align:middle line:90%
that we have access to.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Past lives-- do we tap
into them with our subconscious

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.280 align:middle line:90%
mind?

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So with
past lives, that

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:36.430 align:middle line:84%
can happen of you having
those experiences.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't tap in and
don't have that experience,

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.700 align:middle line:90%
but you certainly can.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, it can
be extremely profitable.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For?

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, for example,
you might have, let's say,

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:84%
a lot of resentment
towards someone,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:84%
or you might be incredibly
afraid of water,

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.550 align:middle line:84%
let's say, for
example, and swimming.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you tap into a previous
lifetime where you drowned.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And once you become free
of all of that worry,

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.405 align:middle line:84%
now you can go swimming and
enjoy that aspect of life.

00:36:18.405 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.580 align:middle line:84%
What other practical
ways do people then

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.260 align:middle line:90%
tap into their subconscious?

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to do
a little exercise for us

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.440 align:middle line:90%
to teach us that.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So I am going to--
yeah, I'm going

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.340 align:middle line:90%
to actually teach you this.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:84%
There are other ways to
access the subconscious,

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.640 align:middle line:84%
but this method is
through the body.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It's super fast,
and it's super easy.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Try it out.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So what
we do here is we're

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:50.960 align:middle line:90%
going to isolate a circuit.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So you take the
tip of your tongue,

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and you put it onto
one of your back teeth.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: (MUFFLED) Yeah?

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And then
you very, very slowly--

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and when I mean slowly
is there's three pieces,

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.550 align:middle line:90%
components to this process.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Number one is, what are
we going to focus on?

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:14.690 align:middle line:84%
In today's example,
we're going to focus

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:84%
on the great times of my life,
the great aspects of my life.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: (MUFFLED) I still
have my tongue on my teeth.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And now you put the
tongue on the tooth.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the third one
is you rotate your eyes

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:35.510 align:middle line:84%
while thinking about all of
the great aspects of your life

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.260 align:middle line:90%
very, very slowly.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at my eyes and
how slowly they're moving,

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.110 align:middle line:84%
you want to move
extremely slowly

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:50.540 align:middle line:84%
while keeping the tip of
the tongue onto the tooth

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and focused on the
great times of my life.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, what does this do?

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: What it
will do is you'll

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:07.270 align:middle line:84%
have a vivid picture in your
mind of reliving experiences

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that you've completely
forgot about.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And each
individual tooth

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
is like changing the
channel of a TV set.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:84%
The first tooth may be a time
when you were in college.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The next tooth, you're
going to be at a great time

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:84%
when you were very young, and
it was Christmas or Hanukkah

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, and
you were having a great time.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:37.090 align:middle line:84%
The next tooth, you might
have been on vacation.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.030 align:middle line:84%
The next tooth, you
were getting married.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The next tooth--
but either, it's

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:90%
like changing channels of a TV.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what does the
eyes have to do with it?

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Every single
position of the eyes

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is a different
part of the brain.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The
tooth is isolating--

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.940 align:middle line:84%
the tip of the tongue to the
tooth is isolating a circuit.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.150 align:middle line:84%
There is a circuit of energy
that goes from the belly button

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:11.540 align:middle line:84%
up through the tip of the tooth,
and we're basically closing

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.010 align:middle line:90%
a circuit with the tooth.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And when your eyes get
to a certain position

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and that tooth is
locked into position

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:26.240 align:middle line:84%
with the tongue, what happens
is it's like tuning an antenna.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.710 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, it's like--

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:28.820 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZED BEEP]

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:29.930 align:middle line:90%
And you'll pop.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:90%
You'll get the picture.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, the amazing thing here
is, is that these are repressed

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:84%
memories that you have
no idea about that

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.170 align:middle line:90%
are going to come up.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if you're
actually there reliving.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And, hopefully,
good memories, right?

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.940 align:middle line:84%
This first exercise, we're
doing on good memories,

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:90%
the great times of your life.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we
want to do this

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is there's very little
resistance to it,

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.560 align:middle line:90%
and it's super easy to do.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have your techniques
changed since the last time

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.850 align:middle line:90%
you were on our program?

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So the techniques
are constantly evolving.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.810 align:middle line:84%
This discovery happened
a few years ago,

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and we are in a constant process
of learning and exploring.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.830 align:middle line:90%
So, yes, they're even better.

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you use this
in your day-to-day life, Bill?

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, how I use
this particular technique,

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:41.340 align:middle line:84%
this particular aspect, is
where I don't understand,

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:45.860 align:middle line:84%
like, why am I nervous
about something.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.520 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you know what it is?

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I don't
even know why,

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:84%
but I got a feeling in my
body like I'm all jittery,

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.517 align:middle line:90%
and I'm nervous.

00:40:55.517 --> 00:40:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like butterflies?

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Like butterflies,
maybe, but not in a good way.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And I would go through
the individual teeth,

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.340 align:middle line:90%
and I locked onto one--

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Until it went away?

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well,
I locked onto it,

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.380 align:middle line:90%
and then I could actually see--

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh my gosh, there
was an issue where I was a kid,

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:24.492 align:middle line:84%
and my dad had driven our
car into basically a river.

00:41:24.492 --> 00:41:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This happened?

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It happened.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.440 align:middle line:90%
And I was there as a little boy.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I was probably only
maybe four or five.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.583 align:middle line:84%
But the water was all the
way to the doors, and the--

00:41:35.583 --> 00:41:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why did he do this?

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I think he just
thought he could get across it.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He thought he
could get across the river?

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: He though
he could get across.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: And I was like--

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
have all drowned.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: But I was--

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.700 align:middle line:84%
yeah, well, that's the
way a little boy felt.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.810 align:middle line:90%
We got out of there.

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.410 align:middle line:84%
There was a rope that the
emergency people came,

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and we got out of there.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But as a little
boy, I was there.

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh my
god, I'm going to drown.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was just
absolutely shaken by it.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What results have you
seen through these exercises?

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: There are so many
changes in people's lives

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.060 align:middle line:90%
through doing this.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.500 align:middle line:84%
We have people that
are hypnotists,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.010 align:middle line:84%
therapists, psychotherapists,
acupuncturists.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.820 align:middle line:84%
We have seen
results of utilizing

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.990 align:middle line:84%
this where people's lives
are completely changed,

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:35.330 align:middle line:84%
because not only do they
actually see the event

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:90%
and see the truth--

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.570 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, because they
now know the truth, everything

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:42.410 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:46.760 align:middle line:84%
They see that their parent
actually wasn't bad,

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:84%
that they actually loved them
and were looking out for them.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.060 align:middle line:90%
They see that--

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they have doubts?

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Their
doubts are then gone,

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:58.795 align:middle line:84%
and they see a
different perspective.

00:42:58.795 --> 00:43:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been
able to bend time.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.250 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:04.340 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: So in
the last episode

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.310 align:middle line:10%
that we were on here
on "Beyond Belief,"

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:12.900 align:middle line:10%
we had that whole episode which
was dedicated to bending time.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And it has everything to do
with shifting dimensions.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It's completely different than
what we're doing here today,

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:84%
but if somebody would
like to know about that,

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:middle line:90%
it's a great episode.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.990 align:middle line:90%
It was really super popular.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get ahold of you, Bill?

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.120 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: They can
get ahold of us--

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.920 align:middle line:10%
the best possible
way is to go to

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.400 align:middle line:10%

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.750 align:middle line:10%

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.555 align:middle line:10%

00:43:50.555 --> 00:43:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Thanks, George.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.218 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's a
wonder what you can

00:43:55.218 --> 00:43:56.610 align:middle line:10%
do with the subconscious mind.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:00.120 align:middle line:10%
Use some of these
exercises, train yourself,

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.690 align:middle line:10%
and see what happens.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
