00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.998 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.305 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:25.354 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.354 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.353 align:middle line:10%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.353 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:10%
When I was flying in
from Burbank to Denver,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:10%
way up in the sky,
I had a chance

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:10%
to just see all these
incredible clouds out there.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But what I also saw was
just something very strange.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was either
contrails or chemtrails.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And our special guest
is Sharon Schloss.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Sharon has been an
anti-geoengineering activist,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
author, and writer that
deals primarily with what's

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:90%
going on on this planet.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.772 align:middle line:84%
What a fascinating
world you're in, Sharon.

00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SHARON SCHLOSS: It
is very interesting.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's nothing I ever
expected to get involved with.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:84%
But I had been experiencing
these inexplicable health

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
problems for years,
throughout the 2000s.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:10%
And I thought that I was just a
defective person and wondered,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:10%
what's going wrong with me?

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:10%
And I had a friend point out the
chemtrails one day, years ago.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
he was talking about.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, isn't that
just what planes do?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I had another
person, my partner Gabriel,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:90%
also point it out to me.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And after he pointed it out,
I had two people telling me

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're feeling
bad because of their spraying.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
looking into it.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
this is something--

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:90%
this is a cause for concern.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually able to tie
a lot of my health problems

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:90%
to the chemical spraying.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that these
problems were worse

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:90%
on spray days.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And they included allergies,
sore throats, exhaustion--

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, absolute fatigue,
like chronic fatigue syndrome

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:84%
symptoms, among
also having candida,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.727 align:middle line:90%
all these bodily problems--

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were falling apart.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.351 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: And I was wondering
why because I ate right.

00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I went jogging.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:90%
I exercised a lot.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.162 align:middle line:84%
And I would meditate,
and I thought,

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm doing
everything right.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to tie a lot of
my problems to the spray days.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'd start staying
in on those days.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I adopted a supplement
regimen that helped a lot.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that this was a
problem affecting others.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So I started
researching it and I

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:84%
learned what it's doing
to the environment, what

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:90%
it's doing to us.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that it
was time to stop it.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So I started going
to the streets,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.924 align:middle line:84%
doing marches, the global
march against chemtrails

00:02:39.924 --> 00:02:40.715 align:middle line:90%
and geoengineering.

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:42.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
growing now, isn't it?

00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:43.163 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: It is.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And my partner Gabe and I
would go to farmers' markets

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.305 align:middle line:84%
every Sunday because we
knew that people there

00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:51.850 align:middle line:84%
are concerned about health
and good quality food.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So we would explain it and also
how it's tied with GMO foods.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of connections
to be made with this.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do think
they're trying to do?

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS:
Geoengineering is being

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:84%
done to modify the
weather, primarily.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reasons for this are
for use in warfare by militaries

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and to control
commodities markets.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So companies like Monsanto
want to monopolize the food.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And they can do this by
controlling who gets rain.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who gets the seeds.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Exactly.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.916 align:middle line:84%
And they create conditions in
which normal seeds can't grow.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Because they're putting
these chemicals in the air,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:90%
they're dimming the sun.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And the aluminum is falling into
the earth, acidifying the soil.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:90%
And they're causing drought.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So normal seeds can't
grow in these conditions.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And California is
very susceptible

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:84%
because we're a major
agricultural center.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So they create seeds that can
withstand this abiotic stress.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They have seeds that can
withstand drought and acidified

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.485 align:middle line:90%
soils caused by aluminum.

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: California is having
a major drought right now.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And every chance we get when it
rains a little bit, we think,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:90%
hallelujah.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:90%
But it's a very bad situation.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
They say it's the worst
in 1200 years here.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.385 align:middle line:90%
What's causing this?

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: This
drought is engineered.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.900 align:middle line:90%
It's completely artificial.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
And it can be stopped if
we stop geoengineering.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.105 align:middle line:84%
There is massive spraying of
chemtrails over California

00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:90%
and over the ocean.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And these aerosols that
they're putting into the air

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:84%
are made up of nanoparticulate
heavy metals-- aluminum,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:90%
barium, and strontium.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And so this is creating a
blockage to our rainfall.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:90%
It's altering the jet stream.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And it works in conjunction
with electromagnetic frequencies

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:90%
and radio frequencies.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's put up into
the atmosphere.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:84%
It changes the state
of the atmosphere

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
into something that is very
conductive, a plasma state that

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:90%
can be manipulated.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:90%
So our rain is being diverted.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.140 align:middle line:84%
When you saw the polar
vortex happening,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:84%
that was an instance
of geoengineering,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
which was admitted by
the Obama Administration.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I read an article about
this in the Huffington Post.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
They admitted to
manipulating the jet stream

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
to bring more moisture to the
drought areas of the Midwest,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:90%
which I found ironic.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got too
much rain in the Midwest.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:84%
I spend a lot of
time in St. Louis,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's raining
all the time there.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: That's because
it's being diverted.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.744 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we need
it in California.

00:05:16.744 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Yes, and
there's a reason for that.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:84%
California produces half of
the nation's organic food.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge center
for organic farming.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And the states that are
getting the moisture

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:84%
are the places that grow
GMO corn and soy which

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
are used for processed
junk foods and cattle feed.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's clear where our
government's interest is.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, they do not
want organic foods, do they?

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: They don't.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's because Monsanto and
other companies like Monsanto

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
want to monopolize
the food supply.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, they're just
talking about labeling now.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
USDA is talking about
selling the ability

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:84%
to label and that companies that
do it will probably make more.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going to happen there.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I know if I'm shopping
and I see a label

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.945 align:middle line:84%
that says non-GMO, that's
what I'm going to buy.

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Me too.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.139 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why buy something
that has GMO in it?

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:12.805 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.835 align:middle line:84%
And if they did have
to label GMO's that

00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
would be like putting a skull
and crossbones on the food.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.396 align:middle line:84%
Because once people know,
they don't want to eat it.

00:06:19.396 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they hide it and they
make it obscure so you don't

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.786 align:middle line:90%
really know what you're eating.

00:06:24.786 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
really read the labels.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people just buy
what they think tastes good.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
But really, eating
packaged food in general

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:90%
is not the best way to go.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
The best way is to buy
fresh, organic food.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And we need to support
organic farming.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.629 align:middle line:84%
We need to take the
money away from Monsanto.

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
happening anyway,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:90%
and it's happening organically.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.962 align:middle line:84%
McDonald's is having
a freefall right now.

00:06:48.962 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've
got some problems.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
They're shutting down some
stores and everything else.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: People
want healthy food.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you look here
every day outside at the sky

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and you will see either
chemtrails or contrails.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.095 align:middle line:84%
Huge distinction--
what's the difference?

00:07:05.095 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: The difference
is, once upon a time

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:84%
we only saw contrails,
which were, and still are,

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
very short little jet
trails above 30,000 feet.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
At very cold temperatures
and high altitudes,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:84%
you will see visible vapor
because the condensation

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:90%
will freeze.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
dissipate fast.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.933 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah,
it's like your breath

00:07:24.933 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
on a cold day or the exhaust
from your car on a cold day.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
If you were breathing
on a cold day,

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and you walked across the room,
and your breath followed you

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:84%
on a long trail, what happens
is you will see a short trail.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And it'll dissipate
because it's just

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.684 align:middle line:84%
the freezing of water
vapor, condensation,

00:07:41.684 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:90%
and then it goes away.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very normal.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: And it's normal.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not common.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:90%
It has to be very cold.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a common thing to
see, but they are out there.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.157 align:middle line:84%
But a chemtrail is a trail
that lingers and sticks.

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see grid spraying and
the planes go back and forth,

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see trails
go horizon to horizon.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for this
is this isn't water vapor.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
They're happening at
low altitudes too.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
This is material being
put in the atmosphere.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And I could compare
this with a sky writer.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
When you see someone
doing sky writing,

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:90%
that's not water vapor.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
It's material that sticks
so you can read it.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it keeps
around for a little while.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: It keeps
around for a little while.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.123 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not worried
about sky writing,

00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:90%
but it's just an example.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
The chemtrails stick
and they spread out

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and they create
grids over the sky.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of the day,
you have a murky white haze.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And you have your sun
is dimmed, and it's

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
just a depressing
sight, let alone the way

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:90%
people feel on those days.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
I've had people tell me--
and I've experienced--

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:90%
that people feel crazy.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:84%
They act more erratic,
more rational,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.342 align:middle line:90%
mood swings and physical issues.

00:08:45.342 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
have no idea why.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: No.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just, we can't be
poisoned with heavy metals.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sharon,
what about the pilots

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:84%
who are flying these planes that
are emitting the chemtrails?

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Have we found any of them?

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I tried on
"Coast to Coast."

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
One person called in
once, said he was a pilot.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Most of the guests
do a lot of research,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:90%
but they're not the pilots.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.049 align:middle line:84%
When are we going to get
these pilots admitting

00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:90%
what they're doing?

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.381 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: They do
from time to time.

00:09:14.381 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It's very rare.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:84%
There was a German pilot
that admitted it because this

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:90%
is a worldwide issue.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I found a video on
YouTube of a German pilot

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:84%
admitting to it
and describing it.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:90%
But it's extremely rare.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.957 align:middle line:84%
In the US, it really
doesn't happen.

00:09:27.957 --> 00:09:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These chemtrails
that are up there,

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are days
where the sky looks

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.237 align:middle line:90%
like a tic-tac-toe pattern.

00:09:34.237 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:90%
What's happening up there?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: This
is grid spraying.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
These planes will fly back
and forth and cover the sky.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.346 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the time, the way
they achieve the chemical cover

00:09:42.346 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
is through spraying
grids, which spread out.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:84%
There are other things
they do, though,

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:90%
especially in California.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:84%
The chemtrails that
are sprayed there

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
are usually guidelines to bring
in systems of aerosol matter

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:84%
that's been released
over the ocean.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So they work in two ways.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
They can cover the entire
sky by spraying a grid.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
They can also guide
in systems that

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.249 align:middle line:84%
are done over the ocean as
what they call chembombs.

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a scary word.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:90%
It's an aerosol release.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So they'll put out a large
quantity of this material.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And the grid lines are simply
a guide to bring it in.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Because this is done through
electromagnetic and radio

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So these are-- they
put up the guideline,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and they can tell
what they're doing.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about these pilots

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that I think they need to come
forward and start saying--

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.275 align:middle line:84%
but I guess they're worried
about their jobs and careers,

00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:33.774 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:33.774 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: And lives.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's top secret, and
they're sworn to secrecy.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And they do come out
from time to time.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I do know that people do have
death threats at times when

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:90%
they come out about this stuff.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
People from the inside--
whistleblowers and people

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:84%
who have solutions that
are very revolutionary

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
have had death threats
and have to worry.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you said
earlier that you get sick

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.245 align:middle line:90%
from the spraying.

00:11:00.245 --> 00:11:02.219 align:middle line:84%
And I guess so many
other people do.

00:11:02.219 --> 00:11:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: They do.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Respiratory
diseases and illnesses

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:90%
are at a record rate right now.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.255 align:middle line:84%
You talked to a
pulmonary expert,

00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:12.226 align:middle line:84%
and he doesn't know
what's going on.

00:11:12.226 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
But I know of some
people who have been

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.017 align:middle line:90%
coughing for months at end.

00:11:16.017 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: They call
it the chemtrail cough.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can't live with
nanoparticulate heavy metals

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:90%
in our atmosphere.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:90%
These are toxic to us.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:90%
They're toxic to all life.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you breathe this in,
it causes respiratory illness

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and it causes
neurological illness.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And we see record
amounts of asthma.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who worked
in a pediatric office,

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and she said half of
the kids had asthma.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:90%
This is just too much.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have Alzheimer's
disease and autism.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Things that are connected with
heavy metals are skyrocketing.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And in autism, it is
in one in 50 children,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:90%
even more than that now.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And Alzheimer's
is being found in

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle line:84%
younger and younger
patients, even in their '50s.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So something is going
very, very wrong.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have respiratory
illness going from the eighth

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.161 align:middle line:84%
to the third leading cause of
death in the United States.

00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
So we do have to look at this.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.750 align:middle line:90%
This is not about smog.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Because this is happening
in areas where--

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
about pollution.

00:12:13.035 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: It is pollution,
but it's a different pollution.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a different
kind of pollution.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's nothing
wrong with cleaning up

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:90%
our atmosphere.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: We should clean up--

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --trying
to get rid of that.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
But this is something else
that has a different agenda.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: It's a
whole other animal.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.350 align:middle line:90%
This is deliberate.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we're having
these diseases

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.430 align:middle line:84%
in areas that are remote--
no factories, very few cars.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't because of people
driving around in their cars.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a different form
of pollution altogether.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you talk about
electromagnetic radiation

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.002 align:middle line:84%
that's tied to this, tell
me what you mean by that.

00:12:44.002 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, a lot of
people have heard of HAARP.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that's more common
knowledge than most of it.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The array
out there in Alaska

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.284 align:middle line:84%
that is beaming
into the atmosphere.

00:12:52.284 --> 00:12:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah,
and they will hit

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
a small piece of the
atmosphere with radio

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
frequencies to affect it,
to create weather changes.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just HAARP.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
There are many
facilities like this,

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:84%
both land-based and
sea-based on this planet.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And also locally, cellphone
towers have a part in this.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, whether or not they
operate our cellphones isn't

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:90%
really the issue.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:10%
Because the fact is, what
they do to the atmosphere

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:10%
is they put out positive ions
and electromagnetic frequencies

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:29.040 align:middle line:10%
which inhibit rainfall
and assist in the sticking

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:10%
of the geoengineering aerosols.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have electromagnetic
frequencies

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that can move it around
once it's up there,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:90%
alter jet streams.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, having
these frequencies

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
create such an
unhealthy atmosphere.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.190 align:middle line:84%
It's bad for our Earth,
and it's bad for us.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.294 align:middle line:84%
So this unhealthy atmosphere
works in conjunction

00:13:45.294 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:90%
with the heavy metals.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.085 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking
about metals, and we're

00:13:48.085 --> 00:13:49.210 align:middle line:90%
talking about magnetism.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.254 align:middle line:84%
So they're sticking
around for a reason.

00:13:51.254 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're going
to talk in our next program

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:84%
about the medical issues
that are facing people

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:90%
and what we can do about it.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's no wonder
that so many people

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.970 align:middle line:90%
are whacked out these days.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And they can't put
a handle on it.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even
psychiatrists-- and I've

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
got one, Dr. Peter Breggin, who
has been on our program "Beyond

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Belief."

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:90%
He's against medicating people.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:84%
He can't figure out what's
going on with people.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:84%
The medical community
doesn't know.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: The reason
they don't know

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
is because they
don't want to know.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream science does not
discuss invisible phenomena.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
We have a war here against us
that's not just a chemical war

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.675 align:middle line:90%
but it's also an energetic war.

00:14:33.675 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about something

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:90%
that can't really be seen.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And the chemtrails
themselves can be seen,

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
but so many people are in
denial about that aspect of it.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a lot
of denial and science

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.109 align:middle line:90%
wants to skirt around the issue.

00:14:45.109 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to talk
about the spraying,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want to talk
about the EMF, because one,

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:84%
the spraying is too much to
deal with for so many people.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.967 align:middle line:84%
And the EMF is invisible,
and it's easy to dismiss.

00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's too
much to deal with,

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
because people don't want to
think about what their cell

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:90%
phones are doing to them.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to think about
what their Wi-Fi is doing.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Because these things
are so convenient.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.680 align:middle line:90%
We feel that we need them.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there's a lot of
denial, I would have to say.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking for a
medical answer and a sort

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:90%
of a biological, physical way.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.670 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for what's
going wrong chemically only.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:84%
But the nine nanoparticulates
which many tests can't even

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:84%
pick up because these are
nano-sized particles--

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've told my
kids and my friends,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:84%
try to not talk on the
phone, your cell phone.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Try to text message
or use the speaker

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
but don't hold it up to
your ear all the time.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah, the cell
phones are linked to cancer.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetic
frequencies are not

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:84%
compatible with our
electrical system.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:90%
We are electrical.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything is.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:10%
Everything contains energy.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:10%
Our atmosphere is electrical.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the electromagnetic
frequencies are interfering.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Our body has an
electrical system shaped

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:90%
like the roots of a tree.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.427 align:middle line:90%
The EMF is shaped like an onion.

00:15:57.427 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And so you have your body trying
to conform to the system that

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:90%
doesn't match.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And then your cells
cannot communicate.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And the miscommunication
between the cells

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:90%
is what leads to cancer.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.032 align:middle line:84%
It also makes us feel terrible,
just on a day to day basis.

00:16:10.032 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know why--

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that melancholy
feeling that some people feel.

00:16:13.417 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: And so
many people feel it.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And then they go and try to take
a pharmaceutical drug for it,

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:90%
which is not the answer.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.557 align:middle line:84%
The answer is we need to
clean it out of our bodies.

00:16:21.557 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
We need to clean out
the heavy metals.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.121 align:middle line:84%
And we need to remove
the EMF from our lives.

00:16:25.121 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it affect
people's sleep patterns?

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Absolutely.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you from
personal experience.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
I had a Wi-Fi
unfortunately in my bedroom

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
know at the time.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
why I was waking up

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.567 align:middle line:84%
every couple of hours, every
night, sometimes once an hour.

00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't get a good sleep.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Horrible.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: It was awful.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know why.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got
rid of it, I could

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:90%
sleep through the whole night.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.406 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
a big difference.

00:16:49.406 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I tried turning it
back on again for a guest,

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:52.855 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't sleep again.

00:16:52.855 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you've talked
about negative ionization.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what does at mean?

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Negative ionization
is what creates rainfall

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.298 align:middle line:90%
and what creates clean air.

00:17:02.298 --> 00:17:04.089 align:middle line:84%
So if you've heard
about the Himalayan salt

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.930 align:middle line:84%
lamps and negative
ionizers for your home,

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:90%
these are air cleaners.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
They clean pollutants
out of the air.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And they also create
a relaxing atmosphere.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.579 align:middle line:84%
And so this can actually
be used to benefit

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:90%
us and the atmosphere.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So when I talk about weather
modification, a lot of this

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:84%
is done by spraying
materials and using

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic frequency.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But there are actually companies
that use negative ionization.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
These are also weather
modification companies.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But what they do is
beneficial because it's more

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:90%
of a restoration of climate.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So when we have electromagnetic
devices and electrical devices

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:84%
emitting positive ions
and stray electrons

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
from dirty electricity
into the atmosphere,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
you have an atmosphere where
the hydrogen bond can't form.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And a hydrogen bond is what
you need for clouds for rain.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So what we need is a
negatively ionized atmosphere

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
so that the hydrogen bond
can form between the oxygen

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
molecules and create
clouds and rainfall.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So there are companies that
use rays of poles and wires.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And simply using
electrical energy

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:84%
can remove pollutants from
the atmosphere in this way,

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
like we do in our homes
with the salt lamp.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:90%
And they can promote rainfall.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:90%
And they do this in Mexico.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's really wonderful
that we have this.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not really happening
much in the United States.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
There are a few
companies that do it.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they make money?

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: That's the thing.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.475 align:middle line:84%
And there's not a
lot of money in this.

00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the big money is
behind the chemtrail program,

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
behind this program which
is incompatible with the way

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.940 align:middle line:90%
the earth works.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:90%
But there is some money in it.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
In Mexico, the state pays
for negative ionization.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So they have facilities
set up that create

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:90%
rainfall, reverse drought.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.492 align:middle line:84%
And I have a friend
of mine that went

00:18:50.492 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to Mexico recently said the
time she had been there before,

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:90%
they were chemtrails everywhere.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.047 align:middle line:90%
And this time, there were none.

00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So you see that negative
ionization pulls pollutants out

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
of the atmosphere while
creating rainfall.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These patterns that
are out there that were getting

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:84%
bombarded-- I remember the
Chinese during the Olympics.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
They said, don't worry
about the weather.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:90%
We're going to control that.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:84%
When they made that statement,
Sharon, I went, whoa!

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a government
admitting that they

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:90%
are controlling the climate.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I know.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.839 align:middle line:90%
That's such a great example.

00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the examples that I

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
use when I explain to people
that this is happening.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
We have the technology
to change the weather.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And they did that
in China so there

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.360 align:middle line:84%
would be no rain during the
Olympic opening ceremony.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very easy
to suppress rainfall.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:41.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's not too difficult
to make it happen, either.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to
happen through cloud

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:90%
seeding with silver iodide.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
It can happen without chemicals,
simply using electricity.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But yes, our government has
admitted to geoengineering

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.420 align:middle line:90%
and creating the polar vortex.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And China's government has
admitted to stopping rain.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on for so long.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Our government
used cloud seeding

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
to wash out enemy supply
lines during the Vietnam War

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.139 align:middle line:90%
during Project Popeye.

00:20:04.139 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
That was the operation
where they did that.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going
on for such a long time.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just time for
people to understand

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.460 align:middle line:84%
that it's not healthy
for us or our planet

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:90%
to manipulate the weather.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a disaster, really.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:84%
The negative ionization
is beneficial in drought

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.076 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a different situation
because it doesn't

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
involve chemicals, and
it works in harmony

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth's systems.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And even ionize water
as a cleaning agent, basically.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.050 align:middle line:84%
They're putting on
now filters that

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.710 align:middle line:84%
are ionization machines
on the water that

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:84%
comes in through your main
water system in your house.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.124 align:middle line:84%
And it ultraviolet-ly
zaps everything.

00:20:43.124 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: It's great.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.248 align:middle line:90%
Well, I drink filtered water.

00:20:45.248 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I get all that junk out of my
water, all those heavy metals

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:90%
and the fluoride.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.505 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:20:50.505 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I've heard
about different types

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.485 align:middle line:90%
of water and alkaline water.

00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's all kinds of
stuff people are doing now.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.066 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you got involved
in anti-geoengineering,

00:21:01.066 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
did you ever think
you'd be doing this?

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Never.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:90%
I never could have imagined it.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm an artist and a musician.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:90%
I have a degree in art.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.415 align:middle line:90%
My background is in painting.

00:21:10.415 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a difference.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I know.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:90%
It never occurred to me.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I spent years touring in
bands and playing music.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
When I learned about this,
it struck me so hard.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I realized what a
big deal this was.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't imagine
how many people

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:90%
were suffering from this.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And that just was unbearable to
me, and I had to take action.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And it led to other
things as well.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%
It led to so many
new understandings

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
of so many
interconnected issues.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.866 align:middle line:84%
So my life has changed, and
I live a life of service now.

00:21:43.866 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're glad?

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I am glad.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
what I'm here to do.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's our next step?

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:90%
What do people do?

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I bet if you went out
there and talked to 100 people,

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
90 of them would say, what
are you talking about?

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.060 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean, chemtrails?

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any idea.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about the
people who watch "Beyond Belief"

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.830 align:middle line:84%
or listen to my radio
show, "Coast to Coast."

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Talking about the
general population.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.854 align:middle line:84%
You go out there, they have
no idea what's going on.

00:22:12.854 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Oh, you're right.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
I was doing was just

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
street activism for a long
time, not just the marches

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:90%
but just going out there.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go with my
partner Gabriel.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And he and I would stand at
street corners with signs.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And we'd go up to Hollywood and
Vine near where we were living

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:90%
and try to--

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know that area well.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.868 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: We wanted
to get some people--

00:22:31.868 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell Gabriel to
blow his horn, would you?

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: And he does.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he does.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
He works as hard
as I do on this.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And we noticed a lot
of people don't know.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But more every day,
you'd be surprised.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I've had captive
audience on buses.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I've given speeches on
buses to people about this.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they listen?

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: They do listen.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or do they
say, who is this person?

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Well,
what happens is I

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:84%
start a conversation
with somebody

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:90%
because I couldn't help myself.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:90%
It comes up.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And other
people start listening?

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: And they
start listening.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
I'm reading a book

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:84%
or they want to know what's
going on, what I'm into.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:90%
And I also had fliers about it.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
stand up in the bus?

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I did.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I have stood up in
the back of the bus.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that's a
video I'd like to see.

00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:16.166 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Nobody took
a video of that one.

00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:90%
But I was doing that.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people didn't know.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's not easy
to wake people up.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
But you'd be surprised
how receptive they are.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that there's
a general feeling of,

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:90%
something isn't right.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I think people know that
something isn't right.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Things are upside
down and backwards,

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't make sense.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Good people are suffering.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And people who are doing
evil seem to be doing great,

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:90%
although they aren't.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.525 align:middle line:84%
I assure you than anybody
perpetuating these acts

00:23:44.525 --> 00:23:47.795 align:middle line:84%
has got their own personal
hell to deal with.

00:23:47.795 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you go
outside in the morning,

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and the dew has just kind
of set itself on the grass,

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
you will see what
some people think

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:84%
are spider webs,
all over the place.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.540 align:middle line:84%
They're not spider
webs, are they?

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Well, I'm not sure.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm aware of--

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think it's a fiber.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.192 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Some of the
fibers-- I haven't personally

00:24:09.192 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:90%
experienced the fibers.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some things on a
plant that I was very concerned

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And somebody told me that's
just from spiders and bugs.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that the
fibers are falling.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And there are fibers in
there that Clifford Carnicom,

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Carnicom of the
Carnicom Institute

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.420 align:middle line:84%
has done a lot of
research into what's

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.279 align:middle line:84%
in the chemtrails besides the
heavy metals, the pathogens.

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:35.070 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
strange things in there.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they had the snow that
was burning, the burning snow

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.960 align:middle line:84%
videos that went
viral, this was caused

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.110 align:middle line:84%
by artificial
nucleated snow storms.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.904 align:middle line:84%
So there were
plastics found in it.

00:24:45.904 --> 00:24:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So there are all kinds of
strange things in the mix,

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:90%
depending on what they're doing.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:84%
But when the Obama
Administration

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
talked about creating
the polar vortex,

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:57.570 align:middle line:84%
they mentioned
spraying strands out

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:84%
of airplanes to direct the
jet stream to take away

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.091 align:middle line:84%
California's rain and give lots
of heavy snow and blizzards

00:25:04.091 --> 00:25:04.715 align:middle line:90%
to the Midwest.

00:25:04.715 --> 00:25:06.673 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you noticed
that people in Japan,

00:25:06.673 --> 00:25:08.680 align:middle line:84%
the mentality of
people in Japan,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
is they wear, when they go
out-- and look they look silly,

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:84%
but they wear them--
special air filter masks?

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.430 align:middle line:84%
They go on planes,
and they wear them.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:84%
They're obsessed with
illnesses, viruses, and things

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:30.600 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere to the point
where it's very common for them

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:90%
to wear these.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll have umbrellas
because of the sun.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Oh, I do that.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they have
that mindset and we don't?

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: We just don't think
like that here in America.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.860 align:middle line:90%
We're so busy.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:90%
We're so overworked.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard for us to
think about anything

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:90%
except just getting by.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And so much is
just glossed over.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.696 align:middle line:84%
Our media doesn't really cover
anything of any importance.

00:25:54.696 --> 00:25:55.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what I notice.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the alternative
media, shows like this,

00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.565 align:middle line:90%
it's different.

00:25:59.565 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But what's on television isn't
going to talk about this.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.140 align:middle line:90%
But we do a very high UV index.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And geoengineering is
partly responsible for

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that, I'd say a lot responsible
for the thinning of ozone.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I do carry
an umbrella on sunny days.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.992 align:middle line:90%
I don't like to expose myself.

00:26:17.992 --> 00:26:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And I also don't want to use
sunscreen more than I have to.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I hear it's not
very good for you.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.533 align:middle line:84%
I don't know too
much about sunscreen,

00:26:23.533 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:90%
but I prefer to shade myself.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:90%
And I have worn a mask.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.051 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you have?

00:26:29.051 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: I have.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm that weird person
wearing the mask.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.070 align:middle line:90%
And I don't like doing it.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It makes me feel awkward
because no one else is doing it.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It makes you look
like you have the disease

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and that you're trying
to protect other people.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
people will freak out.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I have seen people get
on a plane with a mask

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:90%
and sit down next to somebody.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:84%
That somebody gets up and
leaves because they think

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.995 align:middle line:90%
that person has a disease.

00:26:56.995 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Yeah, I mean,
it looks a little strange.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I live in LA, so there's a
lot of strange people in LA.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of go under the
radar, even with the mask.

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But I do feel weird
doing it, but I was

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:90%
doing this on heavy spray days.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:90%
We don't have as many anymore.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.454 align:middle line:84%
And I will be getting
to that later.

00:27:14.454 --> 00:27:16.870 align:middle line:84%
We used to have pretty much
terrible spray days every day.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost every day.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: Nowadays, it's not
as much, maybe a day a month.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's because
they have droughted us

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.566 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
I think they think

00:27:27.566 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:90%
they may have gone too far.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: No, I don't
think they care about that.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.233 align:middle line:84%
I think they want to
continue droughting us.

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But this is where the
negative ionization comes in.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have sort of a guerrilla
warfare, weather warfare

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:40.920 align:middle line:90%
segment of the population.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So if this is weather
warfare against us,

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
we've got people fighting
it back behind the scenes.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And so people are
making devices now

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that undo it on such
a massive scale.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:90%
And this is a growing movement.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually
changing things.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we win?

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Can we beat this?

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Absolutely.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I really get upset when I hear
people saying that this is it,

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:90%
and we're all going to die.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's over.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: I really don't
like to hear that because we

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.600 align:middle line:90%
can absolutely win this.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
information on that,

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:13.120 align:middle line:84%
using orgone energy, which was a
discovery of Dr. Wilhelm Reich.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.464 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk more about it.

00:28:14.464 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They went
after him, too.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: And they did
because what he discovered

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.126 align:middle line:90%
was so revolutionary.

00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much anybody
who discovers

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.480 align:middle line:84%
free energy of any type
is going to disappear.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.761 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: That's what happens.

00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered an energy
that is so healthy for us

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.956 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
essence of what we are.

00:28:31.956 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
He was able to
measure scientifically

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.990 align:middle line:84%
what ancient cultures
called chi or prana.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And using this heat,
he thought that this

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:84%
would be great to channel
it and use it, collect it.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
How can we collect
this and use it?

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So he built devices
that would collect it,

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:90%
orgone accumulators.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And he figured out how to direct
it towards the atmosphere.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was on his way.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: He was able
to collect this energy

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and utilize it in
cancer treatment

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.460 align:middle line:90%
and in drought abatement.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about exactly
what's happening today.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:10%
Using what he
discovered then, we

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.939 align:middle line:10%
are able to heal ourselves
and heal our atmosphere.

00:29:07.939 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you, Sharon?

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHLOSS: They can
go to my website.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:90%
It's thechembow.com.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Spell it.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:10%

O-W.com.

00:29:22.885 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:90%
That's thechmbow.com.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.222 align:middle line:90%
It's like a chemical rainbow.

00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on the program.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.138 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHLOSS: Thank you so much.

00:29:28.138 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I look forward
to our second edition.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:10%
There's something very
strange going on here, folks.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
