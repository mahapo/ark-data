>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:10%
And one of our favorites,
Mike Ricksecker with us,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:10%
is an author,
researcher, filmmaker,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:10%
who recently traveled
to Egypt to discover

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.380 align:middle line:10%
stargates that
might have been used

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:10%
for travel in ancient times.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Michael, welcome
back to the program.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE RICKSECKER: Thank
you so much, George.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
being back today.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Mike,
what are stargates?

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:10%
>>RICKSECKER: Stargates
are these gateways

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:10%
to other locations in the
cosmos, these portals that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:10%
can take us to either
other places on Earth

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:10%
or other places
throughout the universe.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are they
like wormholes?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:10%
>>RICKSECKER: You
would use a wormhole

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:10%
to move between these
different portals or stargates.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:10%
So you would have the
gateway on one end, a gateway

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:10%
on the other, and
then the wormhole

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:10%
would be the method of
transport in between.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always wondered
that extraterrestrials

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
would travel from
point A to point B

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:90%
by bending space and time.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.538 align:middle line:90%
How accurate am I?

00:01:14.538 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.455 align:middle line:84%
This could very well
be one of the ways

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
that they are moving back
and forth to our planet.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial
civilizations having

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:84%
many of these
billions of years more

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
to be able to advance their
technology ahead of ours

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
could have figured
out the secret

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
to the Einstein-Rosen
bridge, like you

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
said, bending space
and time, and then

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
the connection between either
side would be that wormhole.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.573 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain the
Einstein-Rosen bridge.

00:01:42.573 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is the idea
that you're trying

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
to take two points
that are extremely far

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
away from each other
in the universe,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and you can't get there
through Newtonian physics.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.850 align:middle line:90%
It just takes too long--

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not possible.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.437 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: --light years.

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the human being would
pass away on a trip that long.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So the idea here is if you
can bend space and time,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and bring those two points
closer to each other,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.398 align:middle line:84%
then you could bridge the
two through that wormhole.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's kind of
like drop right down.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.992 align:middle line:90%
Poof.

00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right, exactly.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a little bit different
because when we usually

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:84%
conventionally
think of a wormhole,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:84%
we think of that tunnel which
as we're making that travel,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
that may be similar
to what it's like.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But when we think of
what something like that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
would look like, we generally
think of you have a hole

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:90%
and you pass right through it.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:84%
But really, when you
take into consideration,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
3D space, it actually

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:90%
comes out more as a sphere.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So it would be a spherical hole
from one point here to another.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a
new physics to talk

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.942 align:middle line:90%
about bending space and time?

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: No,
this is something

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that's actually been around
for a long, long time.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
This is something that the
ancients used to talk about

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and really got lost to time.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're just now
rediscovering today.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The ancients
talked about this?

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.892 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a lot of the
depictions in ancient artwork

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and they show traversing
through the universe,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:84%
traveling across the
skies, they actually

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:84%
mentioned this within
their literature

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:90%
about this type of travel.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have scientists
discovered anything

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:90%
with wormholes?

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well,
it's interesting

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:84%
because there was a new
experiment that was recently

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
revealed here to the
public, November 2022,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
that they had actually
created what they considered

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
to be on a quantum
level actual wormholes

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.667 align:middle line:84%
in the lab that were
connected to each other,

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
well, through the
wormhole but portals

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
on either side connected
through a wormhole.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
do this in the lab.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they do?

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Send something from
one spot to the other?

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.242 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well, it was funny
because as they were talking

00:03:56.242 --> 00:03:58.333 align:middle line:84%
to the press about this,
people were asking them,

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
were you able to send
something through there?

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people
that asked, well,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:90%
could you send a dog through it?

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And the one scientist
kind of laughed and said,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.193 align:middle line:84%
we're talking small
scale right now, and a--

00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And have it
come out as a dog, right?

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.943 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's kind of funny
because why do we immediately

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
go to sending a dog
through a portal?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we try maybe a
probe, something like that,

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:84%
rather than a living
being at this point.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember
the movie The Fly?

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yes.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.213 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where that little
fly got into that transporter.

00:04:26.213 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Exactly.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Turned him
into the brundlefly.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER:
There you go, yeah.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we don't know right now
what the repercussions would

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:84%
be of sending somebody
through something

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:84%
like this, which is
why in science, they're

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:84%
taking a step by step, little
by little, and trying to really

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.510 align:middle line:84%
they're rediscovering a
technology that was lost.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be interesting
to see how far they're

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
able to take this with
the current technology.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.052 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, hundreds
of thousands of people

00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
disappear on this
planet every year.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows where they are.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that they're
stumbling into stargates

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
all around the planet
and they're just--

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.752 align:middle line:90%
they can't get back?

00:05:04.752 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: That's
something I believe.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
that do come back

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and the stories that they tell
are very, very fascinating

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that they were on a
path in the woods,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:84%
heard something off on
the side of the path,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
took a step off into
the brush to take a look

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to see what the noise
was, didn't find anything,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.825 align:middle line:84%
turned around and
get back on the path,

00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and it was completely gone.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're lost in the woods
for days, sometimes weeks--

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scary.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Some never come back.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible
that, yes, some of these

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:84%
have been lost through
portals and what

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:90%
we would also call stargates.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there areas
on this planet like Egypt

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.858 align:middle line:84%
that have more
stargates than others?

00:05:42.858 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well,
that's a good question.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Egypt is one that you see a
lot of that ancient symbolism

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
of stargates throughout
their temples.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Now other locations in
the world like Maramures

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.090 align:middle line:90%
or the Gateway of the Sun.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
These are other locations
that are considered stargates

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
but Egypt seems to have
a great number of these.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm fascinated
by the area of Abydos

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, that
etching that showed

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:90%
a submarine, a helicopter.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.498 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:06:17.498 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well,
that's a great question

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
because when we look
at ancient artwork,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:90%
they drew what they saw.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.677 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at those
etchings, yeah, you're right.

00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Something that looks
like an airplane,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:84%
something that looks like
a tank, a helicopter.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clearly.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Is this a
result of having traversed

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
through the stargate
and coming back

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:90%
and then showing what they saw?

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Abydos is a location that
does have several stargates.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your friend
Muhammad Ibrahim

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.280 align:middle line:90%
shows depictions of stargates.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MOHAMED IBRAHIM: Now,
we see the word stargate

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:90%
in Abydos Temple.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Sab.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And Sab means star
and the symbol gate.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, stargate,
stargate, stargate, stargate.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So if this was just a title,
why we don't see it everywhere

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:90%
next to the name of the king?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Because this is the stargate.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
call [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the symbol
for [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And this symbol was called
[NON-ENGLISH],, [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:90%
white cake.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:90%
White cake.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And John was talking
about white gold.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
They said that they
eat the white gold

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.620 align:middle line:84%
to have these
powers like natives.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:90%
So it could be white cake.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating isn't it?

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Mohamed and I do
these tours together,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Stargates of Ancient Egypt.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And I always learn so much
from him about stargates

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
going there, and going to these
locations in which you see

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:90%
very clearly the word stargate.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:90%
And the word is "saba."

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptian language
didn't really have vowels.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:10.108 align:middle line:84%
So the two letters that
we see, the S and the B

00:08:10.108 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:90%
are the word for stargate.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
determinative characters,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.430 align:middle line:84%
which is the star, and then the
actual gate that are included

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and you have saba, stargate.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And you see these on doorways
into these different rooms.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, the white
cakes, the monatomic white gold

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
that is believed was ingested
in order to activate and access

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:90%
the stargates.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we know where
stargates are today?

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well, that's
a wonderful question.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.325 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we have
these ones like there

00:08:42.325 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt in the
different temples which

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:84%
we believe had been
once working stargates.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a location
in Egypt today.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:84%
It's called-- well,
it's basically

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:90%
a military base in Dahshur.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It's right there by the Red
Pyramid and the Bent Pyramid.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:84%
People call this
Egypt's Area 51.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And it is believed that
there is within Egypt's Area

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:90%
51, a working stargate.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And the stories that
come out of there

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.530 align:middle line:84%
are very fascinating in
which what they've said

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:84%
is it looks like an aurora
borealis on the ground.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And apparently you access this
stargate through the ground,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
essentially stepping
through this Aurora.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:32.107 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have reports of
scientists finding stargates?

00:09:32.107 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well,
that's a great question.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So we have the lab
work that's been done.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:84%
We find other symbolism
like Sri Lanka

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
has a stargate that they have
discovered there that's really

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:84%
etched in stone, so
archeologists have discovered

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:90%
a depiction of one there.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's you have the
lab work, and then you

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:84%
have this ancient symbolism
that's being encountered.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating work, Mike.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle line:90%
How did you begin to do this?

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well, my
interest goes far back to--

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:90%
well, I don't know how far back.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When you were a kid.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.692 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Really,
yeah, as a kid.

00:10:10.692 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:84%
It's always there's
always that interest,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.843 align:middle line:90%
there's always that fascination.

00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I was always
interested in mystery

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and in discovering
truth and knowledge.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I had several supernatural
paranormal experiences

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
as a child, so I was always
invested in that realm.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:84%
When it came to
Egypt specifically,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.840 align:middle line:84%
it was around the
1993 timeframe.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
You had the "Mysteries
of the Sphinx"

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:84%
documentary come out with Robert
Schoch, John Anthony West.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Charlton Heston
was the narrator.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classics.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
it's here on Gaia.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:84%
You can find that on
the streaming platform.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched
that several times.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But back then when
I first saw it,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
it just blew my mind the
redating of the Sphinx.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And just after that, the
movie stargate came out.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So to me it was like
putting 1 and 2 together

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.195 align:middle line:84%
and just a rabbit
hole I went down.

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
found yourself in what

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.862 align:middle line:84%
could be a stargate,
and it was just weird?

00:11:05.862 --> 00:11:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well,
I will tell you

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
this those locations
in Egypt that

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
have been designated
as stargates,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.330 align:middle line:84%
you do feel a palpable
energy in those locations.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
see them or is it

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
like a wavy effect or
anything like that?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: If you
basically put yourself

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
into a meditative state
in those locations,

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
if you just take it in, yes,
you can start to see things

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:90%
like that with your eyes.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
It's truly fascinating
effect that

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:90%
happens within these locations.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:84%
These are very energetic
locations on Earth.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.722 align:middle line:90%
There's that they're palpable--

00:11:41.722 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
in other dimensions?

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: And
that's a great question

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
because when we're
talking about stargates,

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
we typically think of traversing
into the cosmos, another place

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're going from
here to another planet.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But another idea is that
we are possibly accessing

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.810 align:middle line:90%
other dimensions here.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned earlier,
the monatomic white gold.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating
about that substance

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
is we've rediscovered
this here in recent years,

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:90%
David Hudson back in the 1980s.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And while he patented
the process for actually

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.350 align:middle line:90%
creating this substance.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And the tests that they did on
this substance, when they would

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:84%
actually put it in
a pan to weigh it,

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
the whole mechanism
would weigh less.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So pan and all would weigh less
with the substance on there

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.280 align:middle line:90%
than with it off.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.122 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:12:38.122 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was just
at 70 Fahrenheit

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.910 align:middle line:90%
that it would start to do this.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:84%
You raise the temperature
higher and the substance

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:90%
would disappear.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the interesting
things that they did

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
was they took a spatula
and they stirred it around

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:90%
after it had disappeared.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
When they cooled
everything back down,

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:84%
it reappeared but it didn't
look as if the spatula had

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:90%
any effect on it at all.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So the idea here was that
when you heated it up

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
to a certain
temperature, it actually

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.420 align:middle line:90%
passed into another dimension.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So imagine here ingesting
this into your body.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It has antigravity
properties, and it

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:84%
has properties to take it
into another dimension,

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional properties.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going into
these energetic locations,

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:90%
the stargates ingesting this.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So are you going
to another place

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos, another
dimension, an altered

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness?

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Makes you
invisible, doesn't it?

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It could
make you invisible, sure.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The pyramids,
Christopher Dunn has always

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:90%
called them as a power plant.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.343 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
of that theory?

00:13:35.343 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I'm on board
that there were certainly

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.536 align:middle line:84%
some machines that
were providing power.

00:13:41.536 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:90%
I've read his work.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been inside the Great
Pyramid of Giza a few times.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the
smoking gun there

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
is the Queen's Chamber, that
niche that's in the one wall.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It's this little
corbelled niche.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.445 align:middle line:84%
And mainstream archeology
will say, well,

00:14:00.445 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that's a place where a statue or
some sort of idol or something

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:90%
like that was.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.723 align:middle line:84%
But you look on the back
wall of it and it's scorched,

00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:90%
something was burning there.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:90%
And the stone is melted.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:90%
It's been petrified.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if there's a statue
or an idol standing there,

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to have that
effect on the back wall.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So certainly there is
some sort of mechanism

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:90%
going on here with this.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And the locations where
these pyramids were at,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
we're talking hotspot
nodes of telluric current

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.120 align:middle line:90%
from the Earth.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe, yes, they
were harnessing this energy

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.950 align:middle line:90%
from the Earth.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.758 align:middle line:84%
There was some sort
of mechanism inside,

00:14:39.758 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of what
Christopher Dunn is

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
talking about, to create a
massive amount of energy.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that they used to
power some of these stargates.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mike what are the
Holy of Holies, what is that?

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So
the Holy of Holies

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:84%
these are really the most
sacred areas of the temples.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And usually--

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Egypt?

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: In
Egypt, yes, usually

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
we think of a Jewish
synagogue or the Temple

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:90%
of Solomon, that sort of thing.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:84%
But this term was
derived all the way back

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.215 align:middle line:84%
from ancient Egypt, even
the arks when we think

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:90%
of the Ark of the Covenant.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ancient
Egyptians also used arks.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And they would keep the
arks in the Holy of Holies.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.490 align:middle line:84%
But in many of these Holy of
Holies, hatches of this temple,

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
you have these depictions
of the stargates.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually
Hatshepsut's Temple I

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.590 align:middle line:84%
absolutely love because that
is a perfect setup in which you

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
have this symbolism of energy
with the snakes going up

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:84%
the side of the stairway
leading all the way back

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:84%
into the temple
that's in the cliff.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.300 align:middle line:84%
On the one side, you have
the remains of a pyramid,

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:90%
so the base of an old pyramid.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And again, we were just talking
about that being a power plant.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So that would be your power
to charge this whole thing.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you move through
the different courtyards

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and inner sanctums,
you see on the doorways

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
the symbolism for stargate,
stargate, stargate,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:84%
all the way back in the Holy of
Holies of Hatshepsut's Temple

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:90%
on the side wall.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to get
in there because they

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.008 align:middle line:84%
have a couple guards
stationed there that

00:16:12.008 --> 00:16:14.372 align:middle line:90%
will not let you in unless--

00:16:14.372 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So all they do
is stand there all day?

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.622 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: They stand there.

00:16:17.622 --> 00:16:21.898 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because the Bark
Hall that they're standing in,

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:24.190 align:middle line:84%
which is really basically
stands for the transportation

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:90%
They are positioned there.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
They do not let the tour guides
in there to explain anything.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And they have a little
sign on the side

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
under the stargate
symbol that says,

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.045 align:middle line:84%
tour guides please don't
come in and explain anything.

00:16:37.045 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.777 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: They
don't want they

00:16:38.777 --> 00:16:41.230 align:middle line:84%
don't want the tour guides
to explain exactly what this.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And the two guards are
standing there preventing you

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.608 align:middle line:84%
from going into
the Holy of Holies.

00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
If you tip them, they'll
take a photo of it for you.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But what you really want
is to get all the way

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
into the back and
on the one side wall

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
where they actually there's
a cartouche of stars.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is really like
the ultimate symbol

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:90%
of the stargates.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the significance

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:90%
of Elephantine Island?

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER:
Elephantine Island this

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:84%
is a fascinating location
right in the middle of the Nile

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:90%
River.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
And there is an old--
it's in complete ruins.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:90%
There is an old stargate there.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a temple of Khnum
that's there in which actually

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:84%
has depictions of, if you can
believe this, in ancient Egypt

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:90%
priests with Mayan headdresses.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath that
temple is an even older temple.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you are one who believes
on the journey of the Ark

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant making
its way down to Ethiopia,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
this is believed
to be a location

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
in which the Ark of the Covenant
stayed for about 400 years.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe
the Ark of the Covenant

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.265 align:middle line:90%
is still hidden there.

00:17:50.265 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It might be.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: It could be.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It might be.

00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Mike, researcher
Jonny Enoch explains

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:84%
what may have happened
at Elephantine Island.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JONNY ENOCH: We're standing
in Elephantine Island

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
here in Egypt on the
Nile around Aswan,

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and behind me is an
alleged stargate.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Here is a gate that was on
some kind of energy grid

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
where we have this
whole island made of

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.760 align:middle line:84%
rose granite that's resonating
with this kind of energy.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as if during
the cataclysm something

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
was triggered on this
grid or this area

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
where the core just exploded,
and the whole place just

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:90%
was decimated.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Just look at this.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.137 align:middle line:84%
When you look up at this thing,
it's been pieced together.

00:18:30.137 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But something came through here
that was so powerful that it

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:90%
blew the whole place to pieces.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we see all kinds
of magnificent structures made

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:90%
of granite over there.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, why is
that significant?

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, rose granite and granite
are contained with silica,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:84%
which is where we get
silicon microchips from which

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
are a great insulator
and conductor

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.080 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic energy.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And of course, well, we see why
that's important to this place.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It was literally
loaded with energy.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Lastly, one of the Kings who
was obsessed with stargates

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and actually had it in front
of his names was Thutmose III.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we see his
temple and his fingerprint

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.128 align:middle line:90%
right next to this site.

00:19:16.128 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOHAMED IBRAHIM: My question
is not how they made it,

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:84%
but how it was
destroyed this way?

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is not--
wasn't the only shrine.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.040 align:middle line:90%
We had at least 10 or more.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:90%
That is another one there, OK.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.560 align:middle line:84%
That is part of it
of another piece.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
So we have at least 10 shrines.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.605 align:middle line:84%
So what would the reason
for this destruction?

00:19:37.605 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And no way to claim it
is a group of people

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:90%
came and knocked down the place.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:90%
No way, especially this piece.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
From the shape of
this piece, it seemed

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that something happened
here at the center

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and with the strong
wave, this piece

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:90%
was falling to the back side.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're
convinced that's a stargate.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yes.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And the idea there with
that particular temple

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:84%
is that the only
thing still standing

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:90%
is that gateway, that arch.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if there
was a massive energy

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:84%
wave that pulsated through
it and knocked over it,

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:90%
blew it all over.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
that happened?

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I think it's
a distinct possibility.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:90%
If there was something--

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what
may have happened

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
that stargate, what

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:84%
happened on the other
side of the portal.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.213 align:middle line:90%
What was it that blew through.

00:20:27.213 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Was there something
that happened,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:90%
if it was from another planet?

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.298 align:middle line:84%
Was there some sort of
energy or destruction

00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that happened on
that other side that

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.190 align:middle line:84%
blew an energy wave right
through and knocked over

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.990 align:middle line:90%
that temple?

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But the physical evidence
just really shows us

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
that there was
something massive that

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
happened that did not
affect the gate itself,

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.718 align:middle line:84%
which its blocks stacked
on top of each other.

00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:84%
It's probably one of
the most fragile parts

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:90%
of that entire area there.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: But that stayed
and these large, massive--

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, dozens of tons.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
These shrines are made of
granite, very, very heavy,

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and they were knocked over
just like your little building

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:90%
blocks.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Assuming
extraterrestrials

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.540 align:middle line:84%
are visiting us are they
coming through stargates?

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: That is
definitely one way in which

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:20.693 align:middle line:90%
they could be visiting us.

00:21:20.693 --> 00:21:23.430 align:middle line:10%
I believe they're visiting
us several different ways.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:10%
But there could be
locations around the globe

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:10%
today that we're not
aware of that are still

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:10%
active in which they're able to
traverse through to our planet.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because when
people have seen them,

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:84%
they seem to say,
they just disappeared.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So what if they went into
a stargate or a wormhole

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.922 align:middle line:84%
and just came out and
went the other way?

00:21:42.922 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, it's very
possible, and it makes sense.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Again, you take a look
at our Newtonian physics,

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and it would take years
and years and years

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to travel
the cosmos with just

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.230 align:middle line:90%
a spaceship and some rockets.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense that
extraterrestrials have perhaps

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:84%
perfected the idea of the
Einstein-Rosen bridge using

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:84%
stargates, wormholes,
portals, those sorts of things

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.320 align:middle line:84%
to be able to travel rather than
your conventional spaceship.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Or there may be some locations
on the planet in which we could

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
be talking about bigger portals
and stargates where they are

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:90%
able to take a craft through.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:25.333 align:middle line:84%
And instead of their craft
traversing the universe going

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:84%
from solar system
to solar system,

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
they could actually
be taking that craft

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:90%
through the stargate.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about a
stargate that we don't know

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:90%
that you would like to know?

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.475 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER:
[LAUGHS] A stargate

00:22:37.475 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know that
I would like to know.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believe Antarctica
is a wonderful location which

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.040 align:middle line:84%
is still very
mysterious that we don't

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:84%
know a lot about in which there
could be a stargate there.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.435 align:middle line:84%
We've talked before about
the Alaska Triangle.

00:22:52.435 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are
stargates up there.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to
know definitively

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:84%
some of these locations if
there's operating stargates

00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
happening at Dendara?

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Dendara is
a fascinating location.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
It's really just down
the road from Abydos.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:10.170 align:middle line:90%
We have the Zodiac that's there.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a healing
temple of Hathor.

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:16.138 align:middle line:84%
You have the light bulb,
the Dendera light bulb

00:23:16.138 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:90%
that everybody's talking about.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.765 align:middle line:84%
They have some sort of
technology like that.

00:23:18.765 --> 00:23:19.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's ancient, right?

00:23:19.973 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: It's ancient.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.320 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
we found here recently

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
was up on the roof
of the temple,

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.333 align:middle line:90%
it's a room that's up there.

00:23:29.333 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It's really on the other
side of the roof from where

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:37.740 align:middle line:84%
the Zodiac, is a room that has
a lot of symbolism of stargates.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
Mohamed Ibrahim was looking

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:84%
at that he had found some of
the depictions a little bit

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:84%
different than what we're used
to of gates with other symbols

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
inside of it and
then above the stars.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:54.188 align:middle line:84%
And when we were just
recently out there,

00:23:54.188 --> 00:23:56.355 align:middle line:84%
he's showing us a couple
of these things he recently

00:23:56.355 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:90%
discovered.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All excited about it.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.983 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: All excited.

00:23:58.983 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, we notice--

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
no, this actually
wraps around it.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:90%
It goes outside.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:90%
They're all over this temple.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hmm, how
do you explain that?

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: This is a--

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is a room that
was on top of the temple.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a special location.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Again, you have the Zodiac there
which is showing us the stars.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
You have depictions on the
roof of the temple in the lower

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
sanctum showing the ships
across the night sky.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that this was a
room in which they were showing

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:84%
us how the stargates function
and what their functions

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:39.713 align:middle line:90%
were actually for.

00:24:39.713 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
There's still a
lot of research we

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.113 align:middle line:84%
have to do with this
particular room,

00:24:44.113 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and the depictions
there of the stargate

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:90%
since our newest discovery.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.330 align:middle line:84%
There's some correlation
between the different symbols

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:84%
within the gates and something
with the number of stars,

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.295 align:middle line:84%
and we're still trying
to decode that key.

00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You looked
at some discoveries

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.510 align:middle line:90%
at Dendera yourself, didn't you?

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.427 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Correct.

00:25:01.427 --> 00:25:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Back again at the
Temple of Hathor in Dendera.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MOHAMED IBRAHIM: Space.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Space what?

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:90%
We call it space what?

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Spaceship.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, why you don't
call it space rocket?

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the ancient
Egyptian represented

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:90%
ships sailing on the sky.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
All these ships are
sailing on the sky.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the sky
and this is Earth.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.530 align:middle line:84%
This shape is what
we call it, gate.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Now we can see five
stars and that symbol

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:42.670 align:middle line:90%
chipped in the middle.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So that is gate was five
subject, different symbols.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Many stars now like I
can count 4, 8, 12 stars.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I think this man also
but unfortunately

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.236 align:middle line:90%
the scene is destroyed.

00:25:58.236 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:90%
You can even see this one.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Oh, oh,

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.332 align:middle line:84%
>>MOHAMED IBRAHIM:
This is too much.

00:26:03.332 --> 00:26:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: It keeps going.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.332 align:middle line:84%
>>MOHAMED IBRAHIM:
Right, and there's more.

00:26:06.332 --> 00:26:08.010 align:middle line:90%
See, we didn't see this before.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Right
on the other side.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, one with nine
stars out here.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:18.066 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.066 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:90%
It has 9.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this here
is also stargate.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Look right there, the
little symbol right there.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we got more over here.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:36.048 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.048 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MOHAMED IBRAHIM: We made
good discovery, my friend.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those
depictions are dynamite.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
they're really amazing.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And you have like a
double confirmation

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:90%
here that of a stargate.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.105 align:middle line:84%
Of course, again,
the symbolism, you

00:26:53.105 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:84%
have the larger gate
with the other symbols

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:84%
inside like the Djed pillar
with the Stars above it.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But then in the
description up top

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.530 align:middle line:84%
you have some of the
other stargate symbolism

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:84%
there with the gate
with the star above it.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is confirming
for us what

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
we're believing that, yes, these
are depictions of stargates.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going
to find some deeper

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:90%
meaning within these.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And when we take a
look at the Djed pillar

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that's inside the one,
well, the Djed pillar

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
was considered the
backbone of Egypt.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
yearly celebration

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:84%
to celebrate the raising
of the Djed pillar,

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and this was really to
celebrate new energies coming

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
into the land, so this
was very, very important

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:90%
to the ancient Egyptian culture.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old were
those depictions, Mike?

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're talking
around 1500 BC.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
when they were carved.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were amazing.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
absolutely it's beautiful.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:90%
And especially--

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
even do that today?

00:27:47.875 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: A lot
of these things no.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the things I
love about going to Egypt.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.483 align:middle line:90%
I'm always amazed.

00:27:53.483 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My father
was born there.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right, right--

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --Cairo.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.648 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER:
--which is fantastic.

00:27:57.648 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just always amazed
that you see, OK, we just

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:90%
saw a video clip.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.370 align:middle line:90%
You see photos.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:84%
You see documentaries
on ancient Egypt.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's wonderful
and fantastic

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.280 align:middle line:84%
but to actually go inside these
temples and these pyramids

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.370 align:middle line:90%
and get it--

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Awesome.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yes,
it's just awe striking.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.942 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
have an odor to it?

00:28:19.942 --> 00:28:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: You know it's--

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Musky or anything?

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Some
locations do, others don't.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Some locations are able
to ventilate a little bit.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the temples
there's a lot of airflow.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of the pyramids might
get a little musty inside.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And look at the Great
Pyramid, they've

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:90%
got so much traffic in and out.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:84%
They have installed
some ventilation there.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But what was always wonderful
about that was no matter

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.750 align:middle line:84%
how hot it got outside, it
always stayed within the 60s

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.330 align:middle line:84%
inside before it started
becoming a major tourist

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:90%
attraction.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
stargates are really for?

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I think there's
a few different purposes here

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:90%
for the stargates.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Traveling the cosmos, yes.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Traveling to other
locations in the world,

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe so as
well because we see

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different locations
with very similar makeup

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:17.320 align:middle line:84%
like the Step Pyramid at Saqqara
looks very similar to what

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.270 align:middle line:90%
we see in Chichen Itza.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.330 align:middle line:84%
We talked earlier about
where did depictions

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:84%
of Mayan headdresses come from,
there in Elephantine Island?

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But then I also
believe that there

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:84%
were some of these
locations that

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:84%
may not have been a traditional
traversing the cosmos

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.300 align:middle line:84%
but had to do more with
entering into an altered state

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness or entering
into some other dimensional

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.220 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something truly amazing
happened on this planet, Mike,

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.080 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.962 align:middle line:90%
You have to conclude that.

00:29:48.962 --> 00:29:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Oh, absolutely.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that knowledge
has been lost to time,

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:90%
and we're rediscovering it now.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But there was something that
happened in our ancient past

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.420 align:middle line:90%
that was really truly amazing.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Methodologies that other
civilizations across the planet

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:84%
were able to communicate
with each other,

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.940 align:middle line:84%
were able to communicate
with other planets

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.540 align:middle line:90%
across the universe.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I believe we were freely--

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did we lose it?

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Ancient
cataclysms lost to time.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wars.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER:
--unfortunately-- I'm sorry?

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wars.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Wars.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, and certainly wars back at
those times were very barbaric.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.750 align:middle line:84%
They would try to wipe
out entire populations.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Absolute annihilation
or genocide.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:37.340 align:middle line:84%
You have-- you see the flood
story throughout all cultures.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:42.553 align:middle line:84%
And so the survivors of
that flood at that time,

00:30:42.553 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
they weren't interested in
building massive pyramids

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.595 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:30:45.595 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:84%
They were just
trying to survive.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that survival would
last several generations.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And over that
time, the knowledge

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:84%
of how to build some of
these things was lost.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.860 align:middle line:84%
I encourage anybody that
has any interest in this

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.370 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, to come out to
Egypt and experience it.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.960 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely life-changing

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
stargates in Iraq?

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: That's
an idea as well.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.872 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit harder to
confirm that because of--

00:31:15.872 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't get there.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.038 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It's very
hard to access anything

00:31:19.038 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:90%
in Iraq, correct.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During Saddam Hussein's
day, could we have found out?

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well
what's interesting is

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein was very
interested in archeology.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And all
ancients, big time.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.900 align:middle line:84%
The reconstruction
of the Ziggurat of Ur

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.640 align:middle line:84%
we can actually thank
him in part for that.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So I guess perhaps if you
had that distinct interest

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and were a researcher
with some credentials,

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:84%
he may have let
you go out there.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.100 align:middle line:90%
But it would have been still--

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Are the stargates
formed by ETs artificially

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.430 align:middle line:90%
or is it part of our planet?

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:59.236 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I think the
energy is there in our planet.

00:31:59.236 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's magnetism powers
so much around our planet.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a shield from the sun.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about that

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:11.910 align:middle line:84%
is where the magnetic
shield of the Earth

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:84%
hits the magnetism of
the sun out in space

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:84%
they call those X
points, and NASA

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:21.960 align:middle line:84%
has designated those as portals,
which is quite fascinating.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But the energy is definitely
there in the planet.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:84%
We see that in the telluric
currents of the Earth.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:84%
We see that in more commonly
known as the Ley lines,

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and we see in those
hotspot nodes of activity

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:37.633 align:middle line:84%
where they cross that you have
that welling of the energy

00:32:37.633 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:84%
from the Earth's core that
interacts with different metals

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and minerals, and it creates
these different energy fields.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients
knew how to harness

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.115 align:middle line:90%
those in different fields.

00:32:46.115 --> 00:32:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
they were building

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.365 align:middle line:84%
things like the pyramids
or the stone circles

00:32:49.365 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody in modern
times been hurt in a stargate?

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So they
consider it an urban legend,

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
but there's always a grain
of truth somewhere in there.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Something happened,
something happened.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
ever heard the story

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.137 align:middle line:90%
of the Stonehenge hippies.

00:33:11.137 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have not.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: OK.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're about to.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: We're about to.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.495 align:middle line:90%
So this was early 1970s.

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:84%
This was at a point in time
when you could actually

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.710 align:middle line:84%
still go up to
Stonehenge and actually

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.120 align:middle line:90%
camp out if you wanted to.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
group of young adults

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that decided to camp
out at Stonehenge

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and had a little campfire
going and had some tents

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.538 align:middle line:90%
and it was about 2:00 AM.

00:33:34.538 --> 00:33:36.330 align:middle line:84%
There was a storm that
was rolling through.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:84%
There was a policeman that was
passing by and for some reason,

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.970 align:middle line:84%
there was a farmer in the
area that was still up.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And as this storm rolled in
there was this big blue flash

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.300 align:middle line:90%
of lightning.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They heard some screams, and
they noticed that everybody

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that was there at Stonehenge,
those young adults

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.910 align:middle line:90%
had completely disappeared.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof!

00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Poof!

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the question
then becomes, OK, we've

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.800 align:middle line:84%
considered Stonehenge
for calendrical purposes.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.290 align:middle line:84%
We've considered it
for ritual purposes.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:12.130 align:middle line:84%
We've considered it, OK, it
has astronomical alignments.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Was it possibly also some
sort of portal or stargate,

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.929 align:middle line:84%
and did that electrical
surge at that moment

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:23.409 align:middle line:84%
activate it and send them
off to some other dimension?

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might Atlantis have
been swollen up by a stargate?

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.929 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well, I believe
that the Temple of Atlantis

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:37.600 align:middle line:84%
had an active stargate, and
that was a mode of transport

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.980 align:middle line:84%
that they were using frequently
to travel across the universe

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.420 align:middle line:90%
but also around the world.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:84%
We see the Atlantean
symbolism all over.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And where we see that
is in those spiral

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.050 align:middle line:90%
patterns that are in--

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.389 align:middle line:84%
they permeate
throughout all cultures.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:90%
We see it in ancient Egypt.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.590 align:middle line:84%
We see it in Sardinia we see
it in the American Southwest,

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Chaco Canyon, in
which they talk about

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that the spiral patterns were
portals for the star people

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:90%
to use to come here to Earth.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where is
the Temple of Edfu

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Edfu-- that's
also in Egypt along the Nile.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:19.180 align:middle line:84%
You really have
Abydos, Dendera, Edfu.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Edfu is absolutely
fascinating because you

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:24.850 align:middle line:90%
have the pyramid texts there.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:84%
You have the
depictions of what we

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:33.750 align:middle line:84%
believe is a lost account of
Atlantis on the walls there.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.950 align:middle line:84%
It describes a cataclysm that
occurred in which the survivors

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.423 align:middle line:90%
had to recreate civilization.

00:35:39.423 --> 00:35:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.630 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating
about this is when

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:84%
you look at the
story of Atlantis,

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and this was passed
down from Plato

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.690 align:middle line:84%
but where he got it was from his
great great great uncle, Solon,

00:35:55.690 --> 00:36:00.680 align:middle line:84%
when he had visited the
Temple of Sais in Egypt.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is where he learned the
Atlantis story from and passed

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.310 align:middle line:90%
it on now.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:08.710 align:middle line:84%
The Temple of Sais is
in complete ruins now.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.810 align:middle line:84%
There's really
nothing left of it.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:12.780 align:middle line:90%
It's just rubble.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient Egyptians knew--
and a lot of their stories

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.300 align:middle line:84%
are written on papyrus,
and a lot of that

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:90%
was getting lost over time.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.070 align:middle line:84%
They knew they needed to try
to retain the story somewhere,

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.680 align:middle line:84%
so you see pieces of
it in other temples

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and Edfu has a large
chunk of that story.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your friend
Mohamed Ibrahim

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.720 align:middle line:84%
shows depictions of stargates
at the Temple of Edfu.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MOHAMED IBRAHIM: There
is a story written here

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:84%
by the priest, talks
about Atlantis.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.200 align:middle line:84%
When I explained this
to you three years ago,

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:84%
it was because it talks about
the story of immigration,

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and it showed the power
of the natives who

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.560 align:middle line:90%
came through the ocean.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.690 align:middle line:84%
It could be the story
explaining the survivors

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:90%
after the cataclysm.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.540 align:middle line:90%
But what cataclysm?

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Not the one 9,700 BC.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:07.635 align:middle line:84%
This is what I want you to know,
that most of the cycles, we

00:37:07.635 --> 00:37:10.530 align:middle line:84%
talk about it, it
didn't happen one time.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.250 align:middle line:90%
It could happen 100 times.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So we had several
ice ages before,

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and the end of each ice
age was flood or was rain

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:25.570 align:middle line:90%
and too much water on Earth, OK?

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:29.320 align:middle line:84%
In this temple, we are
going to see different type

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.290 align:middle line:84%
or different style of the
work the stargate again

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:33.145 align:middle line:90%
like this one.

00:37:33.145 --> 00:37:36.800 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, to make sure you
understand that this

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.105 align:middle line:90%
is a stargate and this one.

00:37:42.105 --> 00:37:44.940 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it
is above the star,

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:84%
above the gate, so
stand next to the gate.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.782 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic, isn't it?

00:37:52.782 --> 00:37:54.365 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It's
really fascinating.

00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this area of
research, I think,

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:58.640 align:middle line:84%
is one that we need to
concentrate on a little bit

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.285 align:middle line:84%
more because it's right there
in plain sight to be deciphered.

00:38:02.285 --> 00:38:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he knows his stuff?

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.038 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: He really does.

00:38:05.038 --> 00:38:06.545 align:middle line:90%
Mohamed, he's an Egyptologist.

00:38:06.545 --> 00:38:08.610 align:middle line:90%
He studied under Zahi Hawass.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:09.410 align:middle line:90%
He's been doing--

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Zahi is now touring
the country, our country,

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.915 align:middle line:84%
doing speaking engagements
about the pyramids.

00:38:14.915 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely,
a very, very learned man.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.550 align:middle line:90%
He definitely knows his stuff.

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:20.383 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:38:20.383 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Michael, how do people
get a hold of you?

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.750 align:middle line:10%
>>RICKSECKER: You can find me--

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.600 align:middle line:10%
my website is
mikericksecker.com.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.790 align:middle line:10%
You can also find my
online learning portal

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.110 align:middle line:10%
connecteduniverseportal.com.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:34.100 align:middle line:10%
We have a course out
there on ancient Egypt,

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.510 align:middle line:10%
and we also have our Stargates
of Ancient Egypt tour,

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.400 align:middle line:10%
second one, coming up here.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.192 align:middle line:84%
And you can find that
information out there

00:38:42.192 --> 00:38:43.150 align:middle line:90%
at both those websites.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You obviously
love what you do.

00:38:44.885 --> 00:38:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Oh, absolutely.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.670 align:middle line:90%
This is a passion.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.837 align:middle line:90%
This is an absolute passion.

00:38:47.837 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What will we
find out about stargates

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.500 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know now?

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.875 align:middle line:10%
>>RICKSECKER: I
think we're going

00:38:53.875 --> 00:38:56.648 align:middle line:10%
to find a lost chapter of
our humanity, something

00:38:56.648 --> 00:38:57.690 align:middle line:10%
that's been lost to time.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.570 align:middle line:10%
I think a lot of these
symbols that we see,

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:10%
that we are rediscovering
now are really a memory.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And we are now just finally
interpreting those memories,

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.385 align:middle line:90%
and we're coming back to life.

00:39:12.385 --> 00:39:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, thank you
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Thank you so much
for having me again, George.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.790 align:middle line:90%
It's been an absolute pleasure.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.207 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Can you
imagine stumbling

00:39:19.207 --> 00:39:22.470 align:middle line:10%
into a stargate and you
can't find your way back?

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.370 align:middle line:10%
How horrible would that be?

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But it may have happened
to hundreds of thousands

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:28.030 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
