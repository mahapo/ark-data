00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope has worked for the
United Kingdom's Ministry

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:10%
of Defence for 21-plus years.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
His career was to man a
special desk, a UFO desk.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing story,
Nick Pope, the fact

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:90%
that you have done this.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:84%
You've come to "Beyond Belief,"
and many other programs

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:90%
admitting this.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty dramatic, isn't it?

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK POPE: Yes.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:10%
And unlike some of the claims
you hear in this field,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:10%
it's absolutely 100% verifiable.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:10%
You can pick up the phone.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:10%
Talk to the Ministry of
Defence press office,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:10%
and they will confirm
that was my job.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's been mentioned
in British Parliament.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's a paper trail of
documents auditing everything

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:90%
that I did.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, as we've
discussed before,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's quite widely known
now, the British government

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.220 align:middle line:84%
is in the middle of a program
to declassify and release

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:84%
many of the files and documents
relating to my former job.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.333 align:middle line:84%
So all this is now getting
out into the public domain.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to
have a debate about it.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.292 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:90%
How was it created?

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who at the British
Ministry of Defence said,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.518 align:middle line:84%
"Let's man a UFO desk to study
these incredible stories,

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and then let's find a
guy named Nick Pope"?

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, it dates
way back, actually,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to the Second World
War, when we had

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:84%
the sightings of these
so-called foo fighters.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Royal Air Force got
a number of these sightings,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:84%
not just balls of
light, which is,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I think, people's perception
of what the foo fighters were.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.385 align:middle line:90%
Actually, some--

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:03.177 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Flying alongside
our craft, right?

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Speeds and maneuvers
that we couldn't match.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And the perception at first
was that this was some sort

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.050 align:middle line:90%
of Nazi secret weapon.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
After the war, it turned
out the Germans had seen

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.318 align:middle line:84%
and Japanese had
seen things too,

00:02:16.318 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and they'd thought it
was an allied weapon.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But some of these things
weren't balls of light.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:84%
They were structured
metallic-looking craft.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's when the British
government first got into this.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually some
years later, in 1953,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:84%
before we had a formally set
up constituted UFO program

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
with terms of
reference and suchlike.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.845 align:middle line:84%
Before that, it was just
done on an ad hoc basis.

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
see cases that would

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:84%
come across your desk and you
read them, and went, oh my god.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were you that
baffled by some of these?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of the
sightings, of course,

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:90%
didn't get that reaction.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
The day-to-day job was--

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty mundane.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:90%
You'd be looking at radar tapes.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
You'd be analyzing
photos and videos.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And 9 times out
of 10, you'd find

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
a conventional explanation;
aircraft, weather balloons,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.830 align:middle line:84%
meteors, satellites,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:90%
But yes, absolutely.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:84%
There were some,
oh-my-gosh moments.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And particularly when we
had military witnesses.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
We had UFOs tracked
simultaneously on radar--

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
again, as I mentioned
with the Second World War,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
but this goes on to
this day, of course--

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:84%
speeds and maneuvers
that we can't match.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you've got
a pilot telling you,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I was chasing this
thing and suddenly,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.093 align:middle line:84%
zip off to the horizon,
you just-- what can you say

00:03:40.093 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:90%
to someone in that position?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you say, that's probably
just a weather balloon.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Of course, not.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have
the Rendlesham case

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:90%
come across your desk at all?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.855 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain
that one for us.

00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, this was Britain's
best-known and most compelling

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.020 align:middle line:90%
UFO incident.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It took place over a series of
three nights in December 1980

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
at Bentwaters and Woodbridge,
which were actually

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
operated by the US Air Force,
but they were on British soil.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And on the first
night of activity,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.055 align:middle line:90%
a UFO actually landed.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people got close
enough to see strange symbols.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the forest.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: In the forest.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Rendlesham Forest lies
between the twin bases

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:90%
of Bentwaters and Woodbridge.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:90%
They're about a mile apart.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And so this thing
landed in the forest.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:84%
They saw strange symbols on the
side that looked a little bit

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.448 align:middle line:90%
like Egyptian hieroglyphics.

00:04:35.448 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big was the craft?

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: About 9 feet
across, 6 feet high,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:90%
roughly triangular in size.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not huge.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Not huge.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And this forced its way down,
smashing through some treetops

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:90%
into a fairly small clearing.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:90%
So this was not immense.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But on a subsequent
night, the witnesses

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
included the deputy base
commander, Lieutenant Colonel

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Charles Holt. Now, it didn't
land on either the second

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:90%
or the third night.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But Holt saw this
thing performing

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
these extraordinary
maneuvers above his head.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it landed
the first night.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.762 align:middle line:90%
Took off again.

00:05:22.762 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Took off again.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.387 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
came back and hovered.

00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: It came back, yes,
on a second and particularly

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
a third night, when
the witnesses included

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Charles Holt. Holt took a
team of about half a dozen men

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
out effectively trying
to chase this thing,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:84%
trying to run it to
Earth, so to speak.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But at one point, it
fired a narrow beam

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:84%
of light down at the ground just
in front of him and his men.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And he-- looking back
on this, he said, wow.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.175 align:middle line:90%
He said, was this a weapon?

00:05:51.175 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Was this a warning?

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Was this communication?

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stay away from us.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That kind of thing.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.958 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: He didn't know.

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But I-- to answer your
question, yes, this absolutely

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:90%
came my way.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, it took place before
my time on the UFO project,

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:84%
but I did a cold case
review in about '93-'94.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I reinvestigated,
reinterviewed

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the witnesses, looked
at the various documents

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:90%
we got.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the scientific
data that we had in terms

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
of the Defence Intelligence
staff analyzed radioactivity

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.050 align:middle line:84%
levels taken at
the landing site.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And their assessment
was that this

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.960 align:middle line:84%
seemed significantly higher
than the average background.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's a direct
quote from a document

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:90%
that's now been declassified.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, let's
jump ahead many years.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's a program called
AATIP that you've investigated.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, AATIP stands
for Advanced Aerospace Threat

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Identification
Program, or does it?

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:90%
There's a debate about that.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It is essentially the US
government's UFO program.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, for years, the US
government, of course,

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.655 align:middle line:84%
had Project Sign, then
Grudge, then Blue Book.

00:07:03.655 --> 00:07:04.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blue Book.

00:07:04.455 --> 00:07:05.255 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:07:05.255 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But in 1969,
they said, well,

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
this subject is no
longer of any interest.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
We have terminated
Project Blue Book.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is investigating.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
were saying, that's not

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:90%
particularly credible.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.485 align:middle line:90%
There must be a program.

00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:90%
It turns out there was.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And at least for some of that
time, it was called AATIP.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mentioned there
was a debate even

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
about the name, Advanced
Aerospace Threat Identification

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Program.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
interesting name.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It is.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But some people say it's
Advanced Aviation Threat

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Identification Program.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And then when we began
to get one or two

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:84%
documents about this, it was
Advanced Aerospace Threat

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:90%
and Identification Program.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.287 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might think
an and here and there

00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:55.495 align:middle line:90%
isn't particularly important.

00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It doesn't mean much.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: But it might.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It might if you make a
Freedom of Information Act

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:90%
request, as many people have.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And you're asking
for the wrong thing.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But you know, there's
another facet to all this.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:90%
It seems to have been--

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:84%
AATIP seems to have fallen
out of a wider program called

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.550 align:middle line:84%
AAWSAP, which was Advanced
Aerospace Weapons System

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.383 align:middle line:90%
Application Program.

00:08:19.383 --> 00:08:20.183 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:08:20.183 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It's real alphabet soup.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, were we
concerned about the Soviets

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
or were we concerned about
an extraterrestrial threat?

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: They have been
very cagey about this,

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.020 align:middle line:90%
as you can imagine.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:84%
There has been very little
public acknowledgment

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:84%
of this, apart from a
grudging confirmation

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
from a couple of
Pentagon spokespeople

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:90%
that, yes, we had this program.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:90%
They've gone forward.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: They've tried
to spin it as being

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:56.860 align:middle line:84%
a program looking at next
generation aviation threats.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's pretty clear
that this was about UFOs.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:90%
And we--

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're pretty
convinced about that?

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I think there are a
number of pointers

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
here, not least the fact
that those people involved

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
in setting up this program
said it was about UFOs.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was set up
largely at the instigation

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:84%
of the former Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:84%
In around 2006-2007, Harry
Reid was having discussions

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.738 align:middle line:90%
with the astronaut John Glenn.

00:09:28.738 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying,
look, we should

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:90%
be doing more about UFOs.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Pilots are seeing these
things, but there's nowhere

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:90%
for them to report.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, John Glenn,
when he was in space,

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:10%
saw some strange things
outside of his spacecraft.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:10%
And a couple of the
other astronauts

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:10%
have seen things, too.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And although he didn't see
things, he had, I suppose,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:84%
what he described as a
spiritual experience.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
Edgar Mitchell.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:10%
And Edgar Mitchell in his
later years, of course,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:10%
was very vocal about UFOs.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Not through
a personal sighting.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.348 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Apollo 14 astronaut.

00:10:03.348 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:90%
He walked on the Moon.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: All-American hero.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody like that
says, not only is this real,

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's extraterrestrial,
and I believe

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
there's a cover up, you'd
better sit up and pay attention,

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.503 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:10:16.503 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:84%
How many people were involved
with this AATIP program?

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Not many.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:84%
There's still much more that we
don't know about this program.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We know that Harry Reid,
following his discussions

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:84%
with John Glenn, got
together with a couple

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
of other senators,
set this thing up.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:90%
We know--

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spent $22
million doing it.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: $22 million
to put a contract out.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is an
interesting point.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the AATIP work
was done by contractors,

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and specifically
Bigelow Aerospace.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Robert
Bigelow, of course,

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:10%
no stranger to this subject
and somebody with a childhood

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He's a believer.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.150 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: He's absolutely.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:10%
And he did that very famous
interview where they said,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:10%
do you believe in this?

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I don't believe it.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:90%
"60 Minutes."

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And I think
the interviewer went

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
on in, as you say,
"60 Minutes," to say,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
don't you worry that people
will think you're crazy?

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I don't care.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
But when he said, I
know this to be true--

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was even
more blunt than that.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, yeah.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Was he talking about AATIP?

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, with what we know
now, the suspicion is yes.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
His knowledge of this in
part came from the fact

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that Bigelow Aerospace got a
lot of the AATIP contract work.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, that takes it
largely outside the scope

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
of the Freedom of
Information Act,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.480 align:middle line:84%
because of the exemption that
applies to private contractors.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And it also means that not only
do the people involved in AATIP

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
have their security oath,
government security oath.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:84%
They have private sector
nondisclosure agreements too.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:10%
One of the only people to
talk about this on the record

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.315 align:middle line:10%
is the guy who ran it for a
number of years, Luis Elizondo.

00:12:04.315 --> 00:12:05.755 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He's very believable.

00:12:05.755 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Credible.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:10%
I've spoken to him
a number of times.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:10%
Met him once.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there are
some similarities

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.598 align:middle line:84%
and some differences in
the programs that we ran.

00:12:16.598 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, you put
together a movie on AATIP.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
the name of it?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: "Aliens
at the Pentagon."

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.127 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at part of your trailer.

00:12:24.127 --> 00:12:28.103 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:28.103 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Nick, if the trailer is any
indication of what the film is,

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:90%
you've got a blockbuster here.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I hope so.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I've tried to do
in that is tell the AATIP

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
story in a way that
encapsulates all the information

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
we know, but makes it readily
digestible for people,

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
new to the subject

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're
deep specialists.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.337 align:middle line:84%
It's a real data
mining exercise.

00:14:15.337 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
How did AATIP come to
the public's forefront?

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, "The New
York Times" broke the story

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:90%
just over a year ago.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And they put it
on the front page.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were closely
followed by "The Washington

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.523 align:middle line:90%
Post" and Politico.

00:14:31.523 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
dramatic coverage.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.107 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: It doesn't get much
more dramatic than that.

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:84%
For years, these were the sorts
of mainstream media outlets

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
that either didn't touch
this subject at all,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
or if they did, occasionally,
it was in a sort of ridiculing,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.413 align:middle line:90%
jocular fashion.

00:14:46.413 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, very humorous.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But now
this was undeniable.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:84%
The government said for
years after Blue Book closed

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have a program.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they found out that
this AATIP project existed.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's been some
staggeringly little pushback.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And the ramifications
of this are immense.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the government,
successive administrations

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
said there's no
program, and there was.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So front page of "The New York
Times," global media coverage.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And it took this subject
out of the fringe

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and into the mainstream in a
way that I haven't seen before

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:90%
in my time in this subject.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Rock musician
Tom DeLonge from Blink-182

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:10%
put together a group called
Stars of the Academy.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.530 align:middle line:10%
And he is looking for
disclosure as well.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Is he tied into the
AATIP program at all?

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Or where is that?

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: It's a sort of
dotted line connection.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Tom DeLonge, to the
best of my knowledge,

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
has never worked
for the government.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.385 align:middle line:90%
But he has a passion for this.

00:15:50.385 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
He assembled around him
an extraordinary team

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
of people, many
of whom had served

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
in government and in the
intelligence community.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
whistleblowers?

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I would not categorize
them as whistleblowers,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
because to me,
whistleblowers are

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:84%
speaking without authorization
and they are leaking things.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've sat down
with Lou Elizondo.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.212 align:middle line:84%
And he is a patriot
and a loyal man.

00:16:18.212 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Government official.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.972 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: He's only
speaking about this

00:16:21.972 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:84%
because the government
have confirmed

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
the program itself.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the same
situation as me.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider
myself a whistleblower.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But Tom DeLonge has assembled
this team of people,

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Lou Elizondo, but also
other people involved

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
like Hal Puthoff, Eric
Davis, a number of scientists

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:90%
who've looked at--

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I guess you'd call it
almost fringe science

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
from within the government and
the intelligence community.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, taking forward some of
that work outside of government

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:90%
in this privately funded--

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a public benefit
corporation the To the Stars

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Academy of Arts and Sciences.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have
private stockholders now.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what Tom DeLonge has done
is assemble this team really

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:84%
to continue some of the work
that was being done by AATIP

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:90%
and maybe by a similar program.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is AATIP still around
or has it been disbanded?

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: That is a really
important question.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:84%
And nobody really
knows the answer.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Lou Elizondo said--
his phrase was,

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:90%
we never got a stand down order.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the military and in
the intelligence community,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
you carry on with the mission
until you are stood down.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So he is very much implying
certainly-- maybe he stated--

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:90%
that it's still running.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Others, when you look at the
Pentagon spokespeople who

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:84%
grudgingly confirmed
that there's a program,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
they've tried to spin the line
that this kind of terminated

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
in about 2012.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
The honest answer is
we don't really know.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the big
unanswered questions.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your film
"Aliens at the Pentagon,"

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
you have highlighted a story
that the Department of Defense

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:90%
released in 2017.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was these Navy jets
chasing what could be a UFO.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.113 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:18:19.113 --> 00:18:21.277 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) It's a
[BLEEP] drone, bro.

00:18:21.277 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) There's
a whole fleet of them.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.988 align:middle line:10%
Look on the ASA.

00:18:24.988 --> 00:18:25.905 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) My gosh!

00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:28.195 align:middle line:10%


00:18:28.195 --> 00:18:30.070 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) They're
going against the wind.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.835 align:middle line:10%
The wind's 120 knots
out of the west.

00:18:31.835 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) Look
at that thing, dude!

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:42.452 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.452 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) That's not
an L&S, though, is it?

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.868 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) That
is an L&S, dude.

00:18:45.868 --> 00:18:47.285 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) Well,
if there's a--

00:18:47.285 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) Look
at that thing!

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.927 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) It's rotating.

00:18:49.927 --> 00:19:00.530 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, I spent
nine years in the Navy.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
These fighter pilots
are darn serious folks.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.150 align:middle line:90%
They mean what they do.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.293 align:middle line:90%
What the heck were they chasing?

00:19:10.293 --> 00:19:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: We don't know.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
For want of a better
phrase, it's a UFO or a UAP,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.880 align:middle line:84%
if you prefer the
terminology that we

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.120 align:middle line:84%
used in the UK, Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:90%
But it was real.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.570 align:middle line:90%
It was being tracked on radar.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
We now not only
have those films.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are three of those
films that we know about.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.892 align:middle line:84%
There are more still in the
Pentagon that I hope will be--

00:19:32.892 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
not made up stuff.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And what's more, at
least two of the pilots

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and one of the radar
operators are now publicly

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:84%
on the record with this, given
that the government has itself

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:90%
confirmed all this.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And David Fravor,
one of the pilots,

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
he kind of gave this classic
quote, I think, about this.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know
what the heck it was,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:90%
but I sure want to fly one.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the craft
were shaped like Tic Tacs.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.415 align:middle line:90%
A kind of oval-shaped craft.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:90%
That was one of them.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, there are
at least three videos

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:90%
that we've seen now.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Many more of them
are still somewhere

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:84%
in the basement
in the Pentagon or

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:90%
some other three-letter agency.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
There's still a lot of
debate and controversy

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:84%
about where all these different
programs are being run out of.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And what they do-- this
is typical government,

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.460 align:middle line:90%
by the way--

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:84%
they change the
title of the program.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.803 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
different versions.

00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, it wouldn't surprise me if
some of that wasn't deliberate.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these things move
between different agencies.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:84%
We know that the DIA
had it for a while.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Then--

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.587 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Passed it on.

00:20:47.587 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Passed it back to
the Department of Defense.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So where it is now,
goodness only knows.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the devil's
own business to try

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:03.438 align:middle line:84%
and spring information
from the government when

00:21:03.438 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:90%
it comes to this sort of thing.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.703 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, how many cases
has AATIP looked at like this?

00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: We don't know.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But sitting down talking to
Lou Elizondo about it, I mean,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:90%
he was a busy guy.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:90%
So three videos that we've seen.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Dozens more.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But many of the things that
they looked at probably

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:90%
didn't involve videos.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not everyone who
sees these things, of course,

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.295 align:middle line:90%
gets it on film.

00:21:27.295 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And that
applies to the military.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I haven't
heard of that in a long time.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is
one of the things

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:84%
that we still have to
discover about this.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And people like Elizondo
have to be careful.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:84%
He is only going to be
able to talk about things

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:84%
that the government
have themselves

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:90%
declassified and confirmed.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, he does
cross that line.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:90%
So he may know more.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Oh, he does know more.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't sit
in an agency like that

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and do a job like that
and not know more.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would they
classify some and not others?

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I think any
time you look at something

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:84%
in government, the
question you ask

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:84%
is, what is the
consequence of disclosure?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And people talk-- when I'm
talking about disclosure,

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't just mean to the
American people, because--

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the world.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:21.833 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It's to the world.

00:22:21.833 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you put information
out there in the public domain,

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
it's not just going
to the American people

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and to our friends
around the world,

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.110 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to the Russians,
the Chinese, the Iranians,

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:90%
the North Koreans, ISIS.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They already
know, though, Nick.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well--

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've had the case
of the Iranian pilots chasing

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.680 align:middle line:90%
a UFO.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Russians
have been doing this.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.693 align:middle line:84%
I don't see any reason
to hide this anymore.

00:22:45.693 --> 00:22:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Not a reason,
maybe, to hide it,

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
but there is a reason, I think,
to hide what we know about it,

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.910 align:middle line:84%
because, look,
technology acquisition is

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of a lot
of the secrecy here.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: And if you look at one
of the most important documents

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:10%
about AATIP that we have,
it's a June 24, 2009 letter

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:10%
from Harry Reid to the
deputy defense secretary.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Who was the senator
of Nevada at the time.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:21.620 align:middle line:10%
And he's writing to Lyn Buchanan
the third, deputy defense

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:10%
secretary.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And he's setting
out the consequences

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:84%
of some of the things
that might stem

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:84%
from a better understanding
of what we're dealing with,

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.620 align:middle line:90%
the phenomenon.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
exotic technologies

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that we might be able to
understand, and then--

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.270 align:middle line:84%
here's the key
thing-- replicate.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But look, there's a race
for this exotic technology.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And if we know about
this and can figure out

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:84%
some of the technology,
so can the Russians and so

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:90%
can the Chinese.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.393 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:23:55.393 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And that's
why the secrecy.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And Harry Reid, he's
blunt about this.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:90%
He puts it on paper.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:10%
And he says, look, if the
Russians, or the Chinese,

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.900 align:middle line:10%
or somebody else gets
this, figures it out first,

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.140 align:middle line:10%
the consequences for
the United States

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:10%
could be catastrophic,
if any of this

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.020 align:middle line:10%
falls into the
hands of an enemy,

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:10%
be they another nation
or a non-state actor.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And he finishes up by saying,
however, if we figure this out

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and if we are first,
the United States

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:84%
will retain its
preeminent position

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:90%
in the world as a superpower.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
Lieutenant Philip Corso

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.100 align:middle line:84%
talked about how he was given
information from Roswell

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:90%
for reverse engineering.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:84%
It was part of his mission
to take these artifacts

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and give them to United
States corporations

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.310 align:middle line:84%
to try to get them to
duplicate or figure out

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:90%
what these things were.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Are we doing that today still?

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Are we still trying
to figure out

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.700 align:middle line:84%
how the technology works
and try to duplicate it?

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I don't have
any insight into that,

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
but one of the
intriguing clues that

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:84%
has come out with
the AATIP story

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:90%
is talk about metamaterials.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.327 align:middle line:90%
Now, some people--

00:25:10.327 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Please,
explain what that is.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: OK.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So exotic materials
that some people believe

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:90%
have come from UFOs.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, are we talking about
debris from crashes?

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And if so, are we talking
about the Roswell debris?

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But we do know
that AATIP and then

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
through AATIP, Bigelow Aerospace
looked at these metamaterials.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, look, everything--
I've heard these

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.120 align:middle line:84%
described in the media
as mystery metals.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:90%
They're not mystery.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Everything sits somewhere
on the periodic table.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:90%
But there are--

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.264 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The elements in
the universe are the same.

00:25:53.264 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:90%
They are the same.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: They are.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
However, however-- there
is a big however here,

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and that's isotopic
ratio analysis.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, all individual elements
have different isotopes,

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:84%
which is all to do with the
different numbers of protons

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and orbiting the
neutrons, et cetera.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about that

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
is that some analyses
of these metamaterials

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.300 align:middle line:84%
looked at in the
AATIP Program seemed

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to suggest
non-terrestrial origin.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:90%
And you can tell.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.763 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same.

00:26:26.763 --> 00:26:27.680 align:middle line:90%
When you do isotopic--

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Non-terrestrial.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Non-terrestrial.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's important.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: It's the
same test that you

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:84%
do to prove that
somebody is selling

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
you a genuine meteorite
as opposed to just

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.610 align:middle line:90%
a rock from their backyard.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I mean, of
course, if you're

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.900 align:middle line:84%
going to pay tens of
thousands of dollars,

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
you need to know
it's the real thing.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.913 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want the meteorite.

00:26:44.913 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Isotopic ratio analysis proves
that it has non-terrestrial

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:55.830 align:middle line:84%
origin, because it's subjected
to cosmic rays that we

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.740 align:middle line:84%
don't get here on Earth,
because we're protected from

00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.850 align:middle line:90%
the atmosphere--

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:90%
by our atmosphere.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:01.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:01.685 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: So this is
the sort of thing.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:90%
AATIP was looking at that.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In 2013,
our dear friend

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Bassett put together the
Citizen Hearing on Disclosure.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing event,
where he put together

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:84%
a number of speakers
in Washington, DC

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:19.950 align:middle line:84%
to come forward
to talk about what

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:84%
they know about the possible
extraterrestrial presence.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
You were one of
those who testified.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:31.330 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) --superiors tell
you that part of your job is

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:38.800 align:middle line:10%
to ridicule English citizens
or any UK citizen who had maybe

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:44.270 align:middle line:10%
filed a report or a sighting
that was legitimate?

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.270 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Nobody told me
to do that directly, sir.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:10%
But there was certainly a
sort of unofficial policy

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:10%
that in responding
to media inquiries,

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.210 align:middle line:10%
the press office
would deliberately

00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:00.640 align:middle line:10%
slip in terms such as "little
green men" and "flying saucers"

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.550 align:middle line:10%
to disparage and
downplay the subject.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.870 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) And they
haven't told you what to say

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:10%
as a private citizen, have they?

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: No, sir.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:13.270 align:middle line:10%
But when I've written books,
which I have in the past,

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:10%
I've had to submit those for
official security clearance.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you think
of that hearing that day?

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It was a great event.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Steve Bassett and
the other organizers

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.290 align:middle line:84%
are to be congratulated
for putting it on.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:27.123 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:27.123 --> 00:28:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But I think
it's really best viewed

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:90%
as a dry run for the real thing.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And the people that were
interviewing us and quizzing

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
us, and grilling us,
as you saw there,

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.800 align:middle line:84%
they were former congresspeople
and one former senator.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But what I think the
Citizen Hearing did

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:84%
is it gave us a blueprint for
what congressional hearings now

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:90%
would look like on this.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.832 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would look like.

00:28:58.832 --> 00:29:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Just so everybody
knows, this was not

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:90%
a real congressional hearing.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a mockup
with real people.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.920 align:middle line:90%
The format was real.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.780 align:middle line:84%
The people who were
interviewing us

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.365 align:middle line:84%
had all served as
congresspeople.

00:29:13.365 --> 00:29:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They asked questions
they would have asked

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:16.823 align:middle line:90%
had they still been in Congress.

00:29:16.823 --> 00:29:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Very much so.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were pretty aggressive
in their questioning.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And this was not a typical
UFO conference, where people

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.240 align:middle line:90%
can just get up and speak.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.543 align:middle line:90%
This was us under the spotlight.

00:29:30.543 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you don't
want to lie under oath.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:32.810 align:middle line:90%
We know what that's all about.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No, absolutely not.

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:35.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, and if--

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't anyway.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But of course, if we get actual
congressional hearings maybe

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:84%
on AATIP, maybe on the
phenomenon as a whole--

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and there are
current discussions

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:84%
almost literally as we speak
about that very thing--

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
that is what they
will look like.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been asked a question

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.850 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't answer directly
because you just didn't

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:90%
want anybody to know something?

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Has that ever happened
in your career?

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Oh, quite a lot.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not just on UFOs, but
on all sorts of other subjects,

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Iraq or
counterterrorism policy,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.640 align:middle line:90%
or intelligence.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.515 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the reason
you hold back is why?

00:30:16.515 --> 00:30:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It's two reasons.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, my sense of loyalty
to the United Kingdom

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.330 align:middle line:90%
and my oath of loyalty.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:84%
But secondly, my secrecy
oath, my security oath,

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:35.860 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, is not just a
question of one's own morality,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.720 align:middle line:90%
but it's the law.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.620 align:middle line:90%
I will not--

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.787 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even at this point?

00:30:39.787 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Even at this point.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I took early retirement from
the Ministry of Defence in 2006,

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.790 align:middle line:84%
but my secrecy oath
binds me for life.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just because
you've left--

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how do you
know, Nick, what to say

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and what not to say so you
don't violate that oath?

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I have through my
21 years in government a very

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
clear idea about what's
classified and what isn't.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But if in doubt, I will
do one of two things.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll either err on
the side of caution

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.740 align:middle line:90%
and not discuss the matter.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Or I will even now reach out
to the Ministry of Defence

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, I've
been asked about this.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Has this been
declassified or must

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I continue to hold the line
on this and not comment on it?

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they would probably
prefer you don't comment on it,

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:90%
I would guess.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.240 align:middle line:90%
In most cases.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.650 align:middle line:90%
But of course, I watch--

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I keep a close eye on what
the Ministry of Defence is

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:84%
releasing, either under
freedom of information requests

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:48.130 align:middle line:84%
or to the National Archives as
part of the general programs.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So I keep a watchful eye on--
and I say every now and then,

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:53.980 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's come out, has it?

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If the Citizen
Hearing for Disclosure

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:84%
became a real hearing
on Capitol Hill,

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.340 align:middle line:90%
would you testify if asked?

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I have had
already some exchanges

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:84%
with at least one staffer on
the Armed Services Committee.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why did it happen?

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So I've given some
briefing already.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that the Senate
Armed Services Committee

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:90%
is having a look at this.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.820 align:middle line:84%
As I say, I've had some
communication with them.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I know that they
have also interviewed

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.690 align:middle line:84%
a couple of the Navy pilots
who chased the UFOs, one

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:90%
of the radar operators.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The House Armed Services
Committee is also involved.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And even the space subcommittee
of the main Science

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and Technology Committee
is having a look at this.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it more properly sits
in the Armed Services Committee,

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:57.700 align:middle line:84%
because I can't imagine that the
military and the intelligence

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:84%
community would be
happy with anything

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:04.270 align:middle line:84%
other than either the Armed
Services Committee or one

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.320 align:middle line:90%
of the subcommittees.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
subcommittee, by the way,

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:13.540 align:middle line:84%
which concentrates on, amongst
other things, emerging threats.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
a very logical place

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:84%
to put this if it doesn't go
to the full committee, that is.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
that's critical here,

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:25.590 align:middle line:84%
because we have had our
airspace violated by something.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know what it is.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Or we're not publicly
telling us what it is.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.890 align:middle line:90%
And to me, that's critical.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:90%
These could be Russian craft.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And our airspace
is being violated.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:84%
We need to get to
the bottom of this.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.300 align:middle line:90%
I agree completely.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Anything in our airspace that
does those sorts of things

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that we saw on those videos
is, in and of itself,

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.950 align:middle line:84%
this is a defense and
national security issue.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I mean,
before you even get

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.323 align:middle line:84%
to the first bit of analysis,
it is automatically a defense

00:34:01.323 --> 00:34:02.490 align:middle line:90%
and national security issue.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, these
things could have been

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:90%
North Korean carrying nukes.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Government, when
it looks at this,

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:13.679 align:middle line:84%
it looks at it through the lens
of threats and opportunities.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.280 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to
anyone in government,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.719 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the
intelligence analysis community,

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.310 align:middle line:84%
you will hear those
two words all the time.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.710 align:middle line:90%
What are the threats?

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And what are the opportunities?

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's not an accident,
therefore, that the T in AATIP

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:90%
stands for Threat.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.909 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:35.969 align:middle line:84%
And that threat is
very real, isn't it?

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It is.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.070 align:middle line:90%
There is a technology here.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And if that technology is
better than us, smarter than us,

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.889 align:middle line:84%
faster than us, well,
hey, we'd better

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.480 align:middle line:90%
sit up and pay attention.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big were
these objects that we

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:90%
saw in this US Navy film?

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I'm not sure that
that data has been released.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I think when you look at
all the different readouts,

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:90%
some of them have been redacted.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.987 align:middle line:84%
So even if I knew
the answer to that,

00:35:07.987 --> 00:35:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I could
say, because we--

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:10.778 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could we even guess?

00:35:10.778 --> 00:35:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I think a couple of
the pilots have made estimates.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have the
figures at my fingertips.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's not huge.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.477 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the
flying football--

00:35:25.477 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they are not small.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No, not small.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But they're not on the
scale of the almost--

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I've heard this phrase;
I'm not kidding--

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:84%
flying football fields
that have been--

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Like the Phoenix Lights of '97.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Not on that scale.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But in one sense, it doesn't
matter what size this thing is.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the parameters in terms of
its speed and maneuverability

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:90%
that is of more concern to us.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I say us, I mean
government corporately.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of publicity do

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.140 align:middle line:84%
you think new congressional
hearings would

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.255 align:middle line:90%
garner if they held hearings?

00:36:02.255 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I think
it would be huge.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.838 align:middle line:90%
I think they would be--

00:36:04.838 --> 00:36:06.588 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd probably
get "The New York

00:36:06.588 --> 00:36:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Times" to cover it,
"The Washington Post."

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Oh, everyone would.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This time.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Everyone would cover it.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, clearly, the story
about AATIP, the fact

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:18.990 align:middle line:84%
that it ran in "The
Times" and "The Post,"

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and Politico, and
Fox, and CNN, I mean,

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.980 align:middle line:90%
this isn't a political issue.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:84%
It's all the networks of all
political persuasions covered

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.170 align:middle line:84%
If we actually got
congressional hearings,

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.460 align:middle line:90%
everyone would cover it.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.470 align:middle line:90%
That's why we might get that.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And I've called for it.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some
discussions about it.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But I can't help but
wonder whether because

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.010 align:middle line:84%
of that publicity what
they'll actually do

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.920 align:middle line:84%
is to continue what
they are already doing

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and just make these sorts
of inquiries in private.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are a lot of
people, Dr. Barry Downing,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:84%
for example, who are convinced
that the UFO presence is

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.750 align:middle line:90%
demonic.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:90%
And they staunchly believe that.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.460 align:middle line:90%
And you know, they may be right.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I
suppose I shouldn't

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.390 align:middle line:90%
be ridiculing people's beliefs.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say it is
ironic, to say the least,

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.270 align:middle line:84%
if the roadblock to serious
scientific investigation

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.480 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs isn't actually
as you would expect

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.690 align:middle line:84%
from hardcore skeptics who
say there's no such thing,

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.200 align:middle line:84%
but from another group
of believers who say,

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.925 align:middle line:84%
there is such a thing,
but it's the devil.

00:37:29.925 --> 00:37:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you think?

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I don't believe in that.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think whatever
we are dealing with here--

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not a believer
in gods and devils,

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and angels, and
demons, and things.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm a nuts and bolts person.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there is something here.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And we do need proper credible
intelligence-led scientific

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:54.370 align:middle line:90%
investigation.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
get one if people

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.480 align:middle line:90%
are talking about demons.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, we probably won't.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.420 align:middle line:90%
You're everywhere.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.660 align:middle line:84%
You were on CNN, talking about
the United Kingdom's file

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.703 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:38:05.703 --> 00:38:07.370 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMPBELL BROWN: The
British government

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:10%
is continuing to
declassify and make

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.720 align:middle line:10%
public some records
it's been holding pretty

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:10%
close to the vest
about UFO sightings

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:10%
during the '80s and '90s.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.240 align:middle line:10%
There are a few surprises
in these so-called X-Files.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.040 align:middle line:10%
Take a look.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.670 align:middle line:10%


00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.400 align:middle line:10%
>>WOLF BLITZER: Files detailing
hundreds of UFO sightings

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.910 align:middle line:10%
reported to Britain's Defence
Ministry are now being released

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:10%
online.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The release of more than
4,000 pages of documents

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:38.380 align:middle line:10%
related to UFO sightings
revealed no fewer than 800

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:10%
alleged encounters
over the last 20 years.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.010 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) 1996 was
the bumper alien year.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.312 align:middle line:10%
609 sightings, up fivefold
from the year before.

00:38:50.312 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWN: We had the chance
this evening to talk

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:10%
with one of the men
who helped investigate

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.600 align:middle line:10%
some of these
astonishing UFO reports.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:00.190 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope spoke to us a
little earlier from London.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, you were part of this
effort to track UFO sightings.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:10%
And I know 90% of
the time, it was

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.080 align:middle line:10%
due to factors like weather,
or an airplane, or satellites.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:10%
But give us some examples
of the kind of reports

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.680 align:middle line:10%
that you were looking into
that were unexplained.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.500 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Well, the cases that
were most interesting to us

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.160 align:middle line:10%
at the Ministry of Defence were
the sorts of cases where UFOs

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:10%
were seen by police officers
or pilots, and indeed,

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.250 align:middle line:10%
where they were
tracked on radar.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.070 align:middle line:10%
Now, a good example
is a case from 1993,

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.920 align:middle line:10%
where I led the investigation.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:37.240 align:middle line:10%
A UFO flew directly over two
Air Force bases in England.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.070 align:middle line:10%
And a report on that went up to
the Assistant Chief of the Air

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:10%
Staff, one of Britain's most
senior military officers.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.660 align:middle line:10%
I mean, here we had huge
triangular-shaped craft

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.290 align:middle line:10%
just flying over large
parts of the country

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:51.670 align:middle line:10%
with total impunity.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:54.130 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWN: So what do
you think it was?

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.810 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Well, we don't
know to this day.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:10%
And the case file
on this incident

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.990 align:middle line:10%
is one of the files that's
been opened to the public.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:07.150 align:middle line:10%
And there's a marvelous quote
in it where my head of division

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:12.190 align:middle line:10%
briefs these senior military
officers and says, in summary,

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.500 align:middle line:10%
there is some
evidence to suggest

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.730 align:middle line:10%
that an unidentified object or
objects flew over the United

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.040 align:middle line:10%
Kingdom on the
night in question.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:10%
And frankly, we didn't
know what else to say.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.020 align:middle line:10%
We'd eliminated all the
conventional explanations.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.450 align:middle line:10%
And we were left with
a complete mystery.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's great
publicity, Nick.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.030 align:middle line:90%
CNN.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my gosh, that's the
equivalent of "The New York

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Times" for cable.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, having
the chance to explain

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to people on
mainstream television

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that, no, this subject
isn't something

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:49.100 align:middle line:84%
to be ridiculed or ignored,
that we do have military cases.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.170 align:middle line:84%
We do have evidence in terms
of good photos and videos

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that imagery analysts within
the intelligence community

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.010 align:middle line:90%
have looked at.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:90%
We have radar data.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.500 align:middle line:90%
We have all this.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And it is a serious defense
and national security issue.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.890 align:middle line:84%
The chance to do those
mainstream media interviews

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.190 align:middle line:84%
is something that I am glad
to have the opportunity

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.195 align:middle line:84%
to do because of my
government background.

00:41:11.195 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's great
publicity, I think,

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.310 align:middle line:84%
for trying to get to
the bottom of this.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I try to be a
spokesperson for this subject

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.420 align:middle line:84%
as a whole, because there's
no getting away from the fact

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that, of course,
there will still

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.950 align:middle line:84%
be media outlets
from time to time who

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.440 align:middle line:90%
do just play this for laughs.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But when I get the opportunity
to have a serious discussion

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:84%
about this and literally get
the message across to millions,

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I see that as me playing a part
in a much wider process that

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:47.140 align:middle line:84%
is aimed, really, at
almost acclimatizing

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.540 align:middle line:90%
the public to this.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And where that
leads, I don't know.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's something
I'm happy to be a part of.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back
to AATIP for a moment.

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:84%
If it's still
ongoing, and we just

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.930 align:middle line:84%
don't know what's
happening, what do you

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:06.760 align:middle line:90%
think they're investigating?

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Are there more cases like
the US Navy jets chasing

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:84%
objects that we
don't know about?

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the ultimate
events-led phenomenon.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:22.840 align:middle line:84%
New sightings, of course, as you
know from your own radio and TV

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.360 align:middle line:90%
shows, happen on a daily basis.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Some of those cases
will involve the military.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that if
AATIP is still active,

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:36.250 align:middle line:84%
they concentrate on
military sightings.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And what I suspect happens is
that if a pilot sees something

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:46.060 align:middle line:84%
on a mission or if
a radar operator

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.540 align:middle line:84%
tracks something, that will
go up the chain of command.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, there
will be someone who says,

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:54.020 align:middle line:90%
I know where that goes.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.470 align:middle line:90%
And it gets sent to AATIP.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Or it wouldn't surprise
me if they've retitled it

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.420 align:middle line:84%
now to throw people
further off the trail

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.770 align:middle line:84%
now this is in
the public domain.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, somebody has
got to be looking at this.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And they will do all
the usual things.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:84%
They will probably sit the
pilots down and interview them

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.380 align:middle line:90%
to get all the information.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.680 align:middle line:84%
They will analyze
the radar data.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.820 align:middle line:84%
They'll probably get into
satellite data as well.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:22.995 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Obviously,
the government

00:43:22.995 --> 00:43:30.920 align:middle line:84%
has 24/7 monitoring through
a wide range of technologies.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot of resources
available to the state

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and in particular,
to the secret state.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, the
work that AATIP was

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.320 align:middle line:84%
doing in terms of research
and analysis, one hopes--

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.990 align:middle line:84%
if they've overcome these
religious roadblocks--

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:53.060 align:middle line:84%
continues with a view,
hopefully, to, A,

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:56.420 align:middle line:84%
making a determination about
what we're dealing with, and B,

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:01.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand some of
the technologies involved here

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and to replicate
them for ourselves.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if there's
nothing we can do?

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And hence, that's why
we're quiet about this.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: That's a very
interesting and not entirely

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.920 align:middle line:90%
implausible scenario.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Arthur C. Clarke once said
that any sufficiently advanced

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.025 align:middle line:84%
technology will be
indistinguishable from magic.

00:44:24.025 --> 00:44:25.650 align:middle line:84%
What if that's what
we're dealing with?

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I think the
scenario you've just set out

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:33.680 align:middle line:90%
is completely plausible.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.013 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you gave a
caveman a cell phone,

00:44:38.013 --> 00:44:39.430 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't even
know what it was.

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: He would think
of it as a shiny rock.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But he wouldn't
know what it was.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And he certainly wouldn't
be able to construct one.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.365 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that's the
scenario that we're in.

00:44:51.365 --> 00:44:55.020 align:middle line:84%
In a universe nearly
14 billion years old,

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.930 align:middle line:84%
we are not statistically likely
to encounter a civilization

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:00.890 align:middle line:90%
50 years ahead of us.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:05.513 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're only 4.5 billion
years old of that 14 billion.

00:45:05.513 --> 00:45:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: There might be
civilizations out there

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:09.237 align:middle line:84%
with a billion years
head start on us.

00:45:09.237 --> 00:45:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: What would their
technology look like?

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even a million years.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, look at
our pace every year, Nick,

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:16.850 align:middle line:90%
with technology.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:21.710 align:middle line:84%
It seems to increase by
double every year or so.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:25.270 align:middle line:84%
It gets better and faster,
and better and faster.

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Add a million years
to where we are today.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, look what
we've done in 2,000 years.

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:84%
We've gone from
the days of Jesus

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.370 align:middle line:84%
walking with rocks and rubble
to where we're going to the moon

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and beyond the solar system.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:43.488 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2,000 years.

00:45:43.488 --> 00:45:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And then you can
shrink it down even more

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and say in just maybe 200
years or 250 years we've

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.480 align:middle line:84%
come from maybe the Industrial
Revolution to the present day.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And exploded.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.957 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And we've
almost literally

00:45:54.957 --> 00:45:58.020 align:middle line:84%
come from horse and cart to
stealth fighter and space

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.550 align:middle line:90%
rocket in 200 years.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adding a million
years, let's say, to knowledge

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.817 align:middle line:84%
is nothing in the
scheme of time in space.

00:46:06.817 --> 00:46:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It's a heart beat.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:08.817 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's nothing.

00:46:08.817 --> 00:46:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: In cosmic timescales
and in geological timescales.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So your scenario
is quite likely,

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that we look at these
things, but at the end,

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.520 align:middle line:84%
even with the full resources
of the intelligence

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.160 align:middle line:84%
community and the military
researching and investigating,

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.660 align:middle line:84%
the answer might just
be a helpless shrug,

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.820 align:middle line:90%
and just we don't know.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What would you--

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:36.080 align:middle line:84%
if you went on national
television today--

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.660 align:middle line:84%
well, you just about
are, aren't you--

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and you had this ability to
talk to millions of people

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:43.970 align:middle line:84%
about the
extraterrestrial presence,

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.380 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I would say,
this is not a joke.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.000 align:middle line:84%
There is good hard
verifiable data.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
know precisely what

00:46:56.150 --> 00:47:00.080 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with, but this is
not a subject to be ridiculed.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It is a subject
that is the subject

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:05.540 align:middle line:84%
of congressional
interest and should

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:09.080 align:middle line:84%
be the subject of formal
congressional hearings.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But even I appreciate that
some of those hearings

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.230 align:middle line:84%
may have to be done
behind closed doors,

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:19.580 align:middle line:84%
because we will inevitably get
into highly classified areas.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a reporter
would say, Mr. Pope, are

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:26.240 align:middle line:90%
we in any danger here?

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: You know, there's
a threat equation.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I know this sounds
kind of crazy.

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:31.580 align:middle line:90%
But there is.

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:34.640 align:middle line:10%
Threat is defined
in the military

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:39.050 align:middle line:10%
as being a product of
capability and intent.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.450 align:middle line:10%
We know what the
capability is, or we

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:44.240 align:middle line:10%
have some fairly good pointers.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.890 align:middle line:10%
For example, watching
those videos.

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: The capability is huge.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.700 align:middle line:84%
What we don't know is
what the intent is.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And any time in an equation
where you have an unknown,

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:59.370 align:middle line:84%
the answer is also
going to be an unknown.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So my answer to
your question is we

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.810 align:middle line:90%
don't know if there's a threat.

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And therefore in government,
the prudent policy

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:84%
is to assume that
there is a threat,

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and then allow yourself
to be pleasantly

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:16.370 align:middle line:84%
surprised and relieved if
it doesn't materialize,

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:19.750 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the other
way around, which is crazy,

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.840 align:middle line:84%
assume there's no threat,
and then get caught out

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.605 align:middle line:90%
if it does prove to be hostile.

00:48:25.605 --> 00:48:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Great information.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Thank you.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.993 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He is a former
member of the United

00:48:31.993 --> 00:48:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Kingdom's Ministry of Defence.

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:38.320 align:middle line:84%
His job was to look at UFO
cases as they crossed his desk.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Remarkable.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:42.490 align:middle line:10%
He has gone public with
many of these cases.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.170 align:middle line:10%
He's the real deal.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:53.931 align:middle line:90%
