00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.966 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.340 align:middle line:10%
What you're about
to hear and see

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:10%
may be one of the most
dramatic, controversial aspects

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief"
we have ever had.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
It deals with what
very well could

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:84%
be an extraterrestrial
presence, maybe.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Jaime Maussan is with us.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Jaime is an investigator.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:90%
He is a journalist.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:90%
He's based out of Mexico City.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And controversy surrounds
your life, Jaime.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIME MAUSSAN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me a little bit
more about your background.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.086 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Well,
I'm a journalist.

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I have been a television--
an investigative journalist

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
for the last 45
years of my life.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I've been working with the
most important journalists

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:90%
in the television in Mexico.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I became reporter, then
anchor, and finally director

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of "60 minutes" in
Mexico for 17 years.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I am director and host
of "Tercer Milenio"

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
for the last 20 years.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:10%
This show presents
different investigations

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:10%
related to science, archeology,
astronomy, and even the UFO

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:10%
phenomenon.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Controversy,
Jaime, surrounds you.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:10%
Back many years ago, there
was a discovery in Colorado

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:10%
by an archaeologist, by an
archaeologist named Palmer,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:10%
who is no longer with us.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:10%
But he found some kind of a
creature, or entity, or body.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you think he found
and then the controversy that

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:90%
surrounds you.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: OK, he found
a very small body,

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:84%
a little child, 29
inches long, according

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:90%
to the documents we have.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And we have even a picture
of the moment of the finding.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:10%
And this body doesn't
fit with the picture

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.240 align:middle line:10%
I received to investigate and
present it later on in Mexico.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:10%
They are two different bodies.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:10%
But people in the US,
especially the Ufologists,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:10%
tried to match
both cases, saying

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:10%
that the body that
I presented belongs

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:10%
to the finding of Palmer.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But I can prove it
with these images

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:84%
that these are two different
things, two different bodies.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you contend
that what Palmer found

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and what you have been working
on are two different entities.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Absolutely.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
The picture I
presented in Mexico

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
was analyzed and investigated by
many experts in Canada, Richard

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Double; in Mexico, Jose
de Jesus Zalce, who

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
is the forensic expert
of the Navy in Mexico.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:84%
The National Institute
of Forensic Science

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:90%
also analyzed this body.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of them told me that
this body has so many anomalies

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:90%
to be considered human.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the smaller body
that Palmer had discovered,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:90%
the 29-inch body, where is that?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Were you ever able to
physically see that?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, no.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And probably that's
the reason people used

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:90%
that to attack the other case.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
For law now in
the United States,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
all the bodies from mummies
from the Native Indians

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:90%
had to be buried.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Then this body is
not longer with us,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:90%
has been buried somewhere.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Someplace.

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And I don't
know where it is.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason I
cannot analyze that body.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.262 align:middle line:84%
However, the picture
I have was analyzed,

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:90%
and we found so many anomalies.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, it
doesn't have a wrist.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have an elbow.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:90%
It has just six ribs here.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
The clavicle is
connected to the ribs.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't have a hip.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a knee.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And I still believe that
what I presented in Mexico

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:90%
is something that is nonhuman.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Can I say this
comes from Roswell?

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:90%
I cannot prove that.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Can I say this is
extraterrestrial?

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Probably I was wrong.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say,
this is not human,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.319 align:middle line:84%
because there are
so many anomalies.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.680 align:middle line:84%
A little boy couldn't
survive with all of those.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the 29-inch body
and the 47-inch body are gone.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Are gone, both.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing else
to investigate there

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately, George.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
But where we can investigate,
and we have been doing that,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.670 align:middle line:90%
is with the Nazca bodies.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Because now we have
physical evidence, evidence

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that is being tested, has
been tested for carbon 14,

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:90%
has been tested for DNA--

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:90%
not right now.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:90%
We're waiting for the results.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:90%
We have X-rays.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:90%
We have CAT scans.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And we have so much.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:90%
We have the physical evidence.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this
is an amazing story.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a story that has gone all
around the planet right now,

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:90%
thanks to you, thanks to Gaia.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I want
people who are not

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
familiar with this story to
understand a little bit more

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:90%
about these Nazca mummies.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.130 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: We were
supposed to see

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:10%
one of the most important
discovery of the 21st century.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Nazca, Peru, home of
one of the most mysterious

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:90%
archaeological sites on Earth.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
A new mystery has emerged
from this remote location,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and it takes us from what
we see above the ground

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:90%
to what lies below.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.527 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.527 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course,
that is a special report

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:90%
that Gaia is presenting.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It is very important for people
to understand that this is

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.350 align:middle line:84%
the region where Erich Von
Daniken wrote his award-winning

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:84%
story of the "Chariots
of the Gods,"

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.415 align:middle line:90%
the Nazca Lines in Peru--

00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: That is correct.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --where you
can only decipher what

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:90%
these objects are from above.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can see spiders--

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and birds.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But you have no idea what they
are when you're on the ground.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, was the
beginning of Eric's theories

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that we have been visited
by extraterrestrials

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.677 align:middle line:84%
from some other
system, of some place.

00:06:21.677 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: What is
very interesting is

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:10%
that this mummy, Maria,
is 1,750 years old.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:10%
It's the exact same
timing that the scientists

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.717 align:middle line:10%
have given to the Nazca Lines.

00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: It's a coincidence.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.695 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want you to tell us, what
was that white chalky material

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
that we saw in that picture
that seems to be enveloped

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:90%
all over this body?

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.213 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We didn't
know what it was.

00:06:48.213 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
It was funny, because we
have never found mummies

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.930 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of material.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:10%
And we found, after analyzing
this in a laboratory

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.150 align:middle line:10%
here in the United States, that
it's diatomaceous earth, which

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:10%
is a--

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's a powdery
substance that the planet has.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It is used for a number
of things, including

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:90%
filtration for water systems.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly, and
insecticide, and also

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:90%
fungicide.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
This compound also
desiccates the bodies.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:84%
If you have an insect and it's
trapped by this diatomaceous,

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:90%
it completely dries the body.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And
that's why we think--

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just about
lasts forever, right?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: That's why we think
that these bodies were buried

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:90%
into that kind of material.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a phytoplankton
from the past.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a fossilized plant--

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: --microplant.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.757 align:middle line:90%
And it has all those properties.

00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a
preservative, isn't it?

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Look at the body and look
at the face of this Maria.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:84%
The face is like you
have never seen before.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Check all the mummies
you want, and you

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
will see that this is one of
the best preserved mummies ever.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Describe
the body for us,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Jaime, for people
who'd looked at,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:90%
who got a quick, quick glimpse.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I noticed three fingers
and things like that.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:90%
But tell us exactly what you--

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.754 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Well, we
we're able to reconstruct

00:08:11.754 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
the body with experts, and what
they found is very interesting.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
The arms were very, very
strong, like a gorilla's arms,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and they were longer
than human arms.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.530 align:middle line:10%
They also-- the face--

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:10%
the face is like
the Homo habilis,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:10%
one of the Homo species from
the past that disappeared

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.580 align:middle line:10%
1,600,000 years ago.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: And it has
the elongated head.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have ears,
and no hair, completely,

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:90%
and many other anomalies.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.587 align:middle line:84%
If you look at that creature,
it had to be terrifying.

00:08:51.587 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Had to be something--

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
it seems to match

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:84%
the description of alien greys
or the praying mantis type.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, but very
similar to humans too.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:90%
We have to understand that too.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And probably the biggest
detail, the biggest example,

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.970 align:middle line:84%
that this is not human are
the three long fingers--

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three fingers.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: --in the
hands and the feet.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It has
no thumb, does it?

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.215 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, it
doesn't have a thumb.

00:09:17.215 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:84%
They said, the skeptics
said, that we cut the fingers

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and we put phalanges
into these fingers.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:84%
This is something
impossible to do.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.030 align:middle line:84%
We took also the skin and
muscle from the fingers,

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and we tested it.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's as old, they
are as old, as the body.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:84%
It means that we haven't
touched those fingers.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Also, it has fingerprints.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Our fingerprints are like this--

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:90%
spiral.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Their fingerprints are linear,
horizontal, very different

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:90%
than us.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
similitudes and anomalies.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, inside the body you
can find the heart, the lungs,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:90%
the stomach and the intestines.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should
be easy to analyze

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:90%
once they get into this.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, of course,
but we need real experts.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.500 align:middle line:84%
We need to take
them out of Peru,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:84%
into an international
institution, multidisciplinary.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.352 align:middle line:84%
And that way we will be able
to really find what it is.

00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many creatures
have they discovered out there?

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: OK, we have
two different species.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:90%
We have two of one kind--

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Maria.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:90%
They're very humanlike.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And a little baby, probably
less than one-year-old.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And it has three fingers, also
very similar to the big one.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, just
a smaller version.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: We have that.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have six other
bodies of small creatures,

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:84%
60 centimeters, which are
more related to reptiles.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
One of them has three eggs
inside the body, still.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eggs?

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Eggs.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big are
the eggs, couple inches?

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No well--
no, probably one inch.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
If we consider the size of
the body, probably one inch.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can the eggs
be analyzed as well?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: With a very good
team of scientists, yes.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you found a couple
humanoid-looking mummies--

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.294 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly.

00:11:17.294 --> 00:11:18.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY:
--reptilian-looking mummies.

00:11:18.835 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Six.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.380 align:middle line:84%
We have six bodies of
reptilians, six bodies that

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:90%
can be analyzed.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they have a tail?

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, they
don't have a tail.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But the face is very
similar, let's say, probably

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:90%
to a turtle.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And the neck is retractable
like the turtles.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And we think there
is some relation

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.292 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of creatures.

00:11:40.292 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it walk upright?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.835 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And it had three fingers too,
and one bone in the arms,

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:90%
one bone in the legs.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you consider
that reptilian figure

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:90%
to be animal or more human?

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They look
to be intelligent.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were buried with the
others in a very sacred place

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:90%
in the top of a mountain.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.480 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, the man
who found them lied to us.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he had
found them in a tomb.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, we know that is not true.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where were they found?

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.611 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They were
found on the top

00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:84%
of a mountain, inside a cave,
full of diatomaceous earth.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
were they laid out?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: They were buried.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.393 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were buried.

00:12:22.393 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, well, we
don't, because unfortunately

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:84%
this, the way it was found,
was completely illegal.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these people look
for these kind of bodies

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:90%
to sell them.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And what we tried to do was
to stop this from being sold.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's very unfortunate
that Peru and the world

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:90%
are losing these precious--

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you gotten some
samples from these creatures?

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.352 align:middle line:84%
The samples are being
analyzed for DNA.

00:12:51.352 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe we are
going to have them

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:90%
ready in the next few weeks.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:84%
They are now being analyzed
in Russia, United States,

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.835 align:middle line:90%
and in Mexico.

00:13:02.835 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And when we have the three
results and we can match them,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
if all of them come
with the same answer,

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be very
difficult now to discredit.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we have
some initial DNA results.

00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Professor Korotkov and
his team have discovered that

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:90%
the strange creature is female.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> They were able
to extract DNA.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.632 align:middle line:84%
They confirmed that this
is female, because there

00:13:28.632 --> 00:13:30.900 align:middle line:90%
was only X strands.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.290 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:10%
>> From the DNA samples of
the mummy now known as Maria,

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:10%
we were able to identify
that this is a woman,

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:10%
as the Y chromosome is missing.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The team also confirmed,
in the DNA process,

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:84%
a strange herbal smell
that came from the sample.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Some experts suggest that it
came from the mummification

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But the question still
remains, was this creature

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:84%
preserved by humans
or nonhumans?

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.674 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.674 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
amazing discovery

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and how exciting that will be
when these results come out.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Explain to me the position
that the body was found in.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.612 align:middle line:84%
It looks as if it died in
some kind of cradle position.

00:14:17.612 --> 00:14:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No, I think that--

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.015 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: It's
the same position

00:14:21.015 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:90%
that we find in many mummies.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
buried by humans.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And once this body died,
before it got still,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.677 align:middle line:84%
they put this position to
bury that in a sacred way.

00:14:35.677 --> 00:14:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They moved the body
into that kind of position?

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you,
Jaime, to speculate,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and this is all speculation,
on 1,700 years ago when

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:84%
these creatures are
roaming the planet.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:90%
What might have been going on?

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Did they get here through
extraterrestrial craft?

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Were they born on this planet?

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.479 align:middle line:90%
What do you think happened?

00:15:00.479 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: It's a
very good question,

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
very difficult to answer.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, can I tell you this?

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
If the small body from a baby,
it comes from the big body--

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
if they both are related, it
means they were born on earth.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:90%
It means they were living here.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:84%
It means they were
here for a long time.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And they-- some of them had
relatives, or kids, or family.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.464 align:middle line:90%
It means that--

00:15:28.464 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a
population of them.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Exactly.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.181 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they have been
always from this planet, maybe?

00:15:37.181 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We haven't
found anything

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.780 align:middle line:90%
like this in any other place.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I think for some
reason they came.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
they came from.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you
if they are ETs.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I think they are-- what
I can say right now--

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:90%
they are nonhuman.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you believe.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: --can be proven.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.803 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be more
difficult to prove that they

00:15:57.803 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:90%
are extraterrestrials.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But sooner or
later, somebody has

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to have this answer
where they came from,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think they
are originally from here.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
However, as I told
you, Homo habilis

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
is very-- it looks
like this creature.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
It means that probably
they were here before

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:90%
and they changed our species.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And our species is
different because of them.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Probably our history
is more related to them

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:90%
than we ever thought about that.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might have they been
left behind for some reason?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to Erich
Von Daniken's work

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:84%
the "Chariot of the Gods," and
we look at the Nazca Lines.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you have
just mentioned, it's

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:84%
the same time period that
these creatures were there.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume for a moment
that the Nazca Lines were made

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrials
or by humans

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to honor the extraterrestrials
and that these creatures were

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:90%
left behind for some reason.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah,
it's a possibility.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can say that is not true.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Probably they were trying
to attract their attention.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can speculate
a lot about that.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.565 align:middle line:84%
But the only real answer is that
they were here, and they were--

00:17:16.565 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've
been discovered.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.273 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: --living with humans.

00:17:19.273 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:90%
They were living with humans.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
They were close
to a civilization

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:90%
that has many mysteries.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:90%
Peru is amazing.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Peru has so many mysteries.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.646 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh, yeah.

00:17:31.646 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: And it's so old.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:10%
They just found this
city Huaca Prieta.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.947 align:middle line:10%
Huaca Prieta's
15,000 years old--

00:17:37.947 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they just found it.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: --proven.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:90%
And just found it.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:84%
It means that there
is so much more.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
creatures being investigated

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:90%
by other areas of Peru?

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Universities?

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.537 align:middle line:90%
Anything like that?

00:17:50.537 --> 00:17:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: From the
very first moment,

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
the archaeologists in
Peru rejected the finding.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Even though they hadn't seen
it, they have not seen anything,

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:90%
they say this is fake.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
really incredible.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Many people are
saying this is a fake.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, present me
one evidence that

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:90%
proves that this is a fake.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it's a
fake, if it's a fake,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:84%
what would it be made
out of, and when would it

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.490 align:middle line:90%
have been done?

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't know.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1,700 years ago?

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: It had to be,
because the fingers are

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:90%
as old as the body.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:84%
You think somebody could
do that 1,700 years ago?

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think so.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.219 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Why would you make
little reptilians?

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.968 align:middle line:90%
Why would you make humanoids?

00:18:35.968 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Why somebody
would do it now?

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is no
reason behind all of this.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is earth-shattering
if the truth comes out

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and the DNA backs up what
you believe it could be.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: History
will have to change.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It means that all
those mysteries

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:90%
that we have from the past--

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids, and the
cities, and the big blocks--

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
everything will
have an explanation.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Then we will have
to change history,

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and we will have to
become more humble.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
We will have to accept,
probably, that we are not alone

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and we have never been alone.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know
Gaia has received

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
millions of hits on
the videos for people

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:90%
who are interested in this.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Have you been approached
by scientists or anybody

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
like that who has also
sparked some interest?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, there
are big institutions

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:90%
working on this case secretly.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:84%
We cannot disclose anything,
because they would retract from

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:90%
the case.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.414 align:middle line:90%
Then we have to wait.

00:19:41.414 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But
something's going on.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Something
is going on.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are some scientists
who want to participate.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But everyone is afraid,
because they could be--

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ridiculed.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.781 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: --discredited.

00:19:52.781 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:90%
They could be affected by this.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
there is not really

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.799 align:middle line:84%
an objective investigation
behind all of this.

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, there should be.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Isn't science's
role to discover?

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And that discovery
could be, it's real.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%
But let's get the answer.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.231 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: That's what I think.

00:20:12.231 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Why in this case,
science believes

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
this is a hoax without one
single evidence of that?

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
We have presented
the carbon 14 test.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:90%
We have presented the X-rays.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:90%
We have presented the CAT scans.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
We have-- we're
trying to do the DNA.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:90%
We have some results from DNA.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But we need the
sequences and so on.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to do
the scientific work,

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and they are trying to
discredit this with no evidence.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jaime, where
are the mummies now?

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: The mummies are
in a hidden place in Cuzco.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:10%
They are on the possession
of the man who found them.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Or wherever-- we have
been able-- every time

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
we ask them that we want to
see or we want to investigate,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:84%
they have allowed us to get in
touch with the evidences again.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who owns the mummies?

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: A man named Mario.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, does
the country of Peru,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.221 align:middle line:90%
do they claim that they own it?

00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Legally, yes.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Legally, they should
belong to Peru.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:84%
However, if they are not
human, if they were not

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
found in a sacred place but
in a cave, they are different.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
They are not exactly,
strictly, forbidden by the law.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:84%
They could say, oh,
they were found in Peru.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:90%
They belong to Peru.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the same
like a traditional mummy

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:90%
or a traditional treasure.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this
individual has them.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The DNA
samples are being done.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are DNA
samples being done just

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.157 align:middle line:84%
on the female creature
or all of them?

00:21:50.157 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: In all of them.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: All of them.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So the reptilians--

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: In both species.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Remember, two species,
because nobody

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:84%
talks about the reptilians,
because there is no way

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:90%
to attack the reptilians.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
entire story and event

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.870 align:middle line:90%
come to you in the first place?

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Back in the
month of March 2017,

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:84%
somebody, one of the
people who worked

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:84%
with me in the
original case in Mexico

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
said, Jaime, I
saw some creatures

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that have some similitudes with
the creature we saw in Mexico.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.230 align:middle line:90%
He said, you should see that.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.640 align:middle line:10%
Then I got in touch with Thierry
Jamin, a French archaeologist

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:10%
that works in Peru.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.696 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him if he could
present me the evidence

00:22:39.696 --> 00:22:40.496 align:middle line:90%
like he did.

00:22:40.496 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:90%
I made an interview to him.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And then I said--

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:90%
I asked if I could go to Peru.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.040 align:middle line:90%
He allowed me to do that.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Then I got in touch with
Gaia, and I asked Gaia

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
if they wanted to
participate in this.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:90%
And they told me yes.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.260 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to participate.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's how everything
begun at the end of the--

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.215 align:middle line:90%
in the month of April.

00:23:05.215 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were talking about
Reptilians that were discovered

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.280 align:middle line:90%
with the other two mummies.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:15.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A Dr. Edson
Salazar was one of those who

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.830 align:middle line:10%
was observing these creatures.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Oh, look.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:90%
Look.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Look at this cool
feature that it has here.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.834 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
important feature.

00:23:24.834 --> 00:23:25.875 align:middle line:90%
Do we have some tweezers?

00:23:25.875 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to cut it, but
I want you to see this here.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
This here comes from the
little tubular fibers.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And here is another.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
It has a thick, compact
fiber, like a packet

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.380 align:middle line:90%
of vascular nerves.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.200 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.160 align:middle line:84%
They fulfill the
anatomical characteristics.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:84%
If this were a fraud
or were put together,

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
whoever did this definitely
had a very broad knowledge

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:90%
of anatomy.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, he
must've been an artisan

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:90%
with a unique skill or ability.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.460 align:middle line:84%
To get this, for example,
these anatomical details that I

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:84%
can assess, these
microfibers here,

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
what would apparently be tendons
or ligaments, you can see them.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.790 align:middle line:84%
This right here is the little
fibers and these two here.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Here's one, and
here's the other.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.364 align:middle line:84%
They're like arteries
or something like that.

00:24:28.364 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How exciting.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.369 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to get the results.

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: You see, they
are organic, completely.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.330 align:middle line:90%
They were not made.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:90%
They are not toys.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
story won't end--

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:84%
if they're not real
for some reason,

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:84%
the story doesn't end
there, because then you

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:84%
have to try to decipher,
why were these made?

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:90%
What was the purpose?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Especially if it were
done a long time ago.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And as the good doctor was
pointing out, whoever did

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.991 align:middle line:84%
make them, if they were made,
understood anatomy very well.

00:25:01.991 --> 00:25:05.097 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Who did
that, the huaqueros?

00:25:05.097 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:90%
People that almost don't--

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they have
had that kind of knowledge?

00:25:07.205 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: --how
to read and write?

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's impossible.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.140 align:middle line:84%
If this was-- if
this was done, it

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:84%
was done by an expert, one of
the best experts in the world.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Where is he?

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, if
they're proven to be real,

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
the story doesn't end
here, because we need now

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:84%
go back and try to understand
everything from the past,

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:84%
considering that these
creatures were real.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:84%
That's what is the most
amazing part of this history.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jaime, do we have any
idea how these creatures died?

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.895 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, that's
another very good question.

00:25:42.895 --> 00:25:47.750 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know how they
died, because they are not hurt.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened to them.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
marks, stabbings--

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.818 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --nothing like that?

00:25:51.818 --> 00:25:53.360 align:middle line:84%
They weren't
sacrificed or anything?

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
That's a very good question,
because I have never

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.117 align:middle line:90%
even thought about that.

00:25:59.117 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There could
be some disease in them

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:90%
for all we know.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, right?

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Probably because
something happened to them

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.314 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, you know?

00:26:06.314 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah,
something happened.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And explain the
difference between the mummies

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:90%
and the reptilians.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have
coexisted together.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet they were
different creatures.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.213 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think their roles were?

00:26:20.213 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They
were very similar,

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.380 align:middle line:84%
because each one of
them had three fingers.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.160 align:middle line:84%
That's the similitude
between the big ones

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and the small ones.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, they
are completely different.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And even with the
bones in the arms,

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the humanlike have
two bones in here.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:84%
The reptilians have
one bone in here.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And they've-- everything
else is different.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it
complicates it and even

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
makes it even more
mystical of course

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:84%
are the fact that we're
looking at two creatures.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Carbon dating taken from the
samples of Victoria indicated

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:10%
that the age was between
987 AD to 1145 AD,

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:09.340 align:middle line:10%
which makes her over 700
years younger than Maria.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:16.799 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: I want to
stress something here.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.490 align:middle line:10%
These are completely
different species

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:10%
even though they both share
many, many characteristics--

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:10%
three-fingered hands and feet,
and longer legs, longer arms.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.807 align:middle line:84%
But they do not appear
to be the same species.

00:27:30.807 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I think
this is going to be

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.530 align:middle line:84%
a big challenge for
science and scientists

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:38.630 align:middle line:90%
to really explain all of this.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And right now,
what we have to do

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:84%
is to focus in the incredible
features of these bodies,

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and then probably try
to relate them, and try

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:84%
to probably, through
them, solve some

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.090 align:middle line:90%
of the big mysteries of history.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible, Jaime,
that these creatures roamed

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.740 align:middle line:84%
the planet all over the
place, not just Peru?

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We haven't found
them in any other place.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.750 align:middle line:84%
However, we know there
are paintings in Egypt.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:90%
There are paintings in Mexico.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:10%
There are some evidences that
prove that people saw something

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:10%
very similar in those places.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't found them.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
However, now that
we know that they

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
were buried in
these kind of caves,

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
we should look carefully in
other places in the world.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Probably,
they are buried

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.377 align:middle line:90%
in the same kind of deposits.

00:28:35.377 --> 00:28:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There could be
hundreds or thousands of these--

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Probably.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mummies everywhere.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.671 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I mean, there
is so much more to come.

00:28:40.671 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:90%
This is just the beginning.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.820 align:middle line:90%
This is the tip of the iceberg.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of everything you've
investigated in your career,

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.424 align:middle line:90%
where would you rate this?

00:28:48.424 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Number one.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
fascinating story

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:84%
because we have
physical evidence.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
very, very difficult

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:90%
to discredit on the long run.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Right now, some people
think, some experts think,

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.250 align:middle line:84%
that they know that
they are hoaxes.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But the bodies are
going to remain,

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:90%
and that's what is important.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.000 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason,
right now, what

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:84%
really bothers me is that we
could lose these bodies if they

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:90%
are not well preserved.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Because
at this moment,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:90%
they are really getting fungus.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.870 align:middle line:84%
They are being affected
by being outside,

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.530 align:middle line:90%
and nobody's doing anything.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And I want to attract the
attention of the world

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to preserve these
bodies, whatever they

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:84%
are, because they could
have answers from the past

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.400 align:middle line:90%
to the future.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he
concerned that somebody

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.927 align:middle line:84%
may try to steal these
mummies from him?

00:29:48.927 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't think
so, because they are well

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.790 align:middle line:90%
hidden until now.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I think he's concerned that
he's going to lose them,

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and I hope he's
going to lose them.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I hope these
mummies will go back

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.180 align:middle line:90%
to Nazca, to the Nazca people.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I hope one day they will
build a museum in Nazca

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.680 align:middle line:84%
to preserve them and to
show them to the world.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that they deserve this,
and this is what should happen.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the
government from Peru

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.860 align:middle line:90%
is not putting attention.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not listening
to all these voices

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that are claiming to
have these bodies back.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they will,
when the time comes.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I hope, but I hope
the bodies will be preserved.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.212 align:middle line:84%
If they are not preserved,
when the time comes--

00:30:32.212 --> 00:30:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's too late.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: --probably
it's going to be too late.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be too late.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And what could DNA
results determine?

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: They could determine
that they are different.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:84%
They are-- one of them is going
to be completely different.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:84%
The small ones are going
to be completely different.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.530 align:middle line:84%
The small ones are
going to be reptilians.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No
question about that.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I
would like to compare

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:84%
how they are to the
reptilians on Earth,

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:84%
or to probably
dinosaurs, or something

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.320 align:middle line:90%
very far away from us.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: The other is
going to be very, very close.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But I want to see
how close it is.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it has these features
from Homo habilis, it's human,

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.480 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time it's
not human and could be

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:90%
related to the past of humans.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I hope to find
many, many answers.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do these doctors
who have looked at the species

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.090 align:middle line:90%
say right now?

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:27.514 align:middle line:90%
I mean, are they baffled?

00:31:27.514 --> 00:31:28.930 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: All the
people who have

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:34.070 align:middle line:10%
looked directly to these
bodies, yes, they are baffled.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.560 align:middle line:84%
The people who
doesn't know anything,

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have the bodies,
and they don't have anything,

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:84%
they are, you know,
this has to be a hoax.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's a real problem.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.170 align:middle line:84%
We want to attract the
attention of the real experts

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to come close to the
bodies, because we

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.890 align:middle line:84%
know that when they come
close to the bodies,

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.460 align:middle line:84%
they will believe
this is probably

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:84%
the most important finding in
the history of human beings.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How disappointed will
you be if the results come back

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and they merely say these
creatures are human,

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.614 align:middle line:84%
they're deformed, or
something like that?

00:32:12.614 --> 00:32:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I don't think
it's going to happen,

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.670 align:middle line:90%
but I would be disappointed.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.560 align:middle line:90%
But that wouldn't matter.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.880 align:middle line:90%
We have to tell the truth.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:84%
If that is the
truth, it's truth.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:26.600 align:middle line:84%
If I have to say I was
wrong, I will say I am wrong.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
In the case of
Mexico, I never said

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I was wrong, because I
don't believe I was wrong.

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:34.200 align:middle line:84%
At this moment,
with these species,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:84%
two different species,
until this moment,

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.840 align:middle line:90%
I believe we are right.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.880 align:middle line:84%
But again, if the
results say otherwise,

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.180 align:middle line:84%
then I would have to accept
it and continue my life.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will this stop
your other investigations,

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.300 align:middle line:90%
regardless of the results?

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, what could
have stopped the other

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:90%
of my investigations is this--

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.040 align:middle line:90%
we have the physical evidence.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.280 align:middle line:90%
If we are not--

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:84%
if we know, when the
DNA comes, and we

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.320 align:middle line:84%
understand that these
are nonhumans and so on.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:84%
If we will lose
this one being real,

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.270 align:middle line:84%
then there is no
reason for anyone

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:84%
to continue in this kind
of field or investigation.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Except
that one day, Jaime,

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.800 align:middle line:84%
you may find something
and discover something

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.926 align:middle line:90%
that could be real as well.

00:33:21.926 --> 00:33:22.841 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: This is it.

00:33:22.841 --> 00:33:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why stop?

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: This is it,
because this is it,

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.210 align:middle line:90%
because I am convinced.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.770 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be very
difficult that the DNA comes

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:84%
in a different way
that I'm expecting.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you are banking
your journalistic career

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.950 align:middle line:84%
on this discovery in terms
of what you think it is.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, I
am, and I don't care.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I think when you believe in
something, you have to risk.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.170 align:middle line:90%
You have to have the courage.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.880 align:middle line:90%
You have to stand.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, when everybody
told me in the Mexico case,

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.680 align:middle line:90%
oh, Jaime, just retire.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Say that you were wrong.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.570 align:middle line:84%
No, because I really
believed this was real.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And now, I really
believe this is real.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I wouldn't
get involved.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.960 align:middle line:90%
This is not a competition.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth for humanity.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.159 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth for the future.

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:14.080 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth for our kids.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.210 align:middle line:90%
That's what really matters.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:18.850 align:middle line:84%
They've been lying to
us for so many years.

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the chance,
because for the first time,

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
humanity has this
kind of evidence.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:84%
In the past, just the
military, the governments,

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else
have kept the evidence.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:39.080 align:middle line:84%
This time, the civilians,
us, we have the evidence.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.739 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
prove finally what

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:84%
really happened in the
past of the human beings.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope we
get these answers,

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.055 align:middle line:84%
because they could just
revolutionize who we are--

00:34:49.055 --> 00:34:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We need
these answers.

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --as a species.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.273 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: Think about it.

00:34:52.273 --> 00:34:53.620 align:middle line:10%
Think about this world.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.420 align:middle line:10%
Think about what is happening.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:59.610 align:middle line:10%
Think how this news
could change everything.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.220 align:middle line:90%
And we need it.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.020 align:middle line:90%
We need to change.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.280 align:middle line:84%
We need a new beginning,
and this is here.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Please give us a chance.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Please be fair to this case.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Please be objective to this
case, not just discredit.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.870 align:middle line:84%
The people in the United
States is very fair.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is the chance.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I-- please ask the scientists.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Please, I ask the universities.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Please, I ask the people
who has the credentials

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:84%
to investigate this, to do it,
because this is the chance we

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:90%
have to make a new humanity.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.631 align:middle line:84%
And it is right here,
and it is right now.

00:35:35.631 --> 00:35:37.171 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be
one of the greatest

00:35:37.171 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:90%
discoveries of all mankind.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: It is.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.780 align:middle line:84%
It is the greatest
discovery of humans.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
chance right now.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Or we can discredit this,
and we put it in the trash

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.030 align:middle line:90%
and forget about it.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.731 align:middle line:84%
The big loser here
would be the truth.

>>NOORY: Keep fighting, Jaime.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: --not Jaime
Maussan, but the truth.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keep fighting.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: I will.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What an amazing story.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:03.070 align:middle line:84%
What a great discovery
in a cave in Peru,

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:84%
these creatures that
you've just seen.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:90%
We'll get the results.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Gaia will pass them
on to you, and then we

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.090 align:middle line:90%
will move on from there.
