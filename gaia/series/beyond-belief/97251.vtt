>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:08.730 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.584 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:13.250 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.520 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: How many
of us pick up the newspaper

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:10%
or watch television
or listen to the radio

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:10%
and daily hear
stories of hacking,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:10%
computer hacking, that
some commercial company has

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:10%
been nailed and
your information,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:10%
your private information,
has been taken,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:10%
confiscated by who knows whom?

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, our guest on "Beyond
Belief" is Charles R. Smith.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
He's an expert in
cyber technology.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
What a field, Charles,
that you're in.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.830 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES SMITH: Well,
it is coming of age.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:84%
We've been in it since the end
of the Cold War, more or less.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:10%
But it's now migrated right
down to your street level.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did it happen?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well,
obviously the advent

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:10%
of the computer
and the Internet,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:10%
and then finally the
computer on your cellphone

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:10%
or your wristwatch or your
camera or your television.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
We've become more or less
like tagged dolphins,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
walking around with electronic
devices all over us.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've become too
technical, haven't we?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: In some cases
that is a big disadvantage.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've actually
found people going back

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:84%
to the good old ways
of using typewriters

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
or not connected
to the Internet.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're the only
ones seem to be secure.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.486 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Charles, what
the heck is a typewriter?

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I remember that.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I used to hunt and
peck all the time

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
when I was doing newscasts
in the early days.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But I only did it with two
fingers, which I still so.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.475 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, nowadays, you'll be
doing it on your cell phone

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be taking a
video at the same time.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And who knows who else
is also watching you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.532 align:middle line:90%
as you're typing it?

00:02:00.532 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.145 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved
in all of this, Charles?

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I backed into this
because I'm an old Cold

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Warrior.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.380 align:middle line:84%
During the original 1980s, we
were transitioning computers

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:84%
from gigantic room-size
things to something that could

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.100 align:middle line:90%
be transported for the US Army.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the items
that we created

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.984 align:middle line:84%
was a global network
for these computers

00:02:22.984 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:90%
to talk to each other.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, as contractors, we
had to talk to each other

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
as well, so I helped develop
a little communication system

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:90%
to talk with each other.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.312 align:middle line:84%
And we also secured
that basically

00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't want the
US Army and the government

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:90%
to see what we were saying.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.175 align:middle line:84%
But one evening a
general walked by,

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
who happened to be the
commander of the base,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and saw me hacking away at
this little communications

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:84%
network with one of my
compatriots in Alaska.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And he inquired,
and I told him what

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:84%
it was, showed
him how it worked,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:84%
how you could secure
it with code words.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we saw
all of the officers

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
on the base who had basically
neglected their computers up

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to that point suddenly
swarming to their computers

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
every day so they could
communicate with each other.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
anticipate the day

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:84%
that people would be
hacking into computers

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:90%
the way they're doing it now?

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, we did.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
We actually tried to harden
some of the Army computers.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And then later on,
as we got further

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
into how things could
happen, we began

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
designing both offensive and
defensive types of systems,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:90%
hardware and software.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I can remember
distinctively speaking

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
with some of my compatriots
saying that, you could destroy

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
a hard drive with a
computer program or a virus

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
if it was downloaded or
placed on a computer.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And they greeted
that with skepticism.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Destroy hardware with
computer software?

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And once we
demonstrated it, that's

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
when a lot of the individuals
involved with the operations

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:84%
became extremely concerned,
because they recognized

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:90%
how vulnerable they were.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
These days, with everything
being computerized,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
we can see that the
communications networks are

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:90%
actually your biggest opening.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Literally, if you open
yourself to the world,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
the world can come storming
right through your front door,

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and it may not necessarily
be a nice kind of world.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:10%
Cell phones and
wireless computers

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:10%
operate with radio
waves, meaning

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:10%
that if I can broadcast and
receive, so can the bad guys.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And as we all know, nowadays
with your credit card,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:84%
the ancient credit
card magnetic stripe

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
contains very little
information as

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
compared to what is necessary
for, say, the credit card

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:84%
industry to secure
your credit card.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:90%
We found that out with Target.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:10%
The hacking of
Target was actually

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:10%
almost an opportunistic
kind of thing,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:10%
where a contractor
for Target was hacked.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:10%
Basically what they were doing
was monitoring Target stores

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:10%
and how much
electricity they would

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:10%
use to heat and/or cool them.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, Target gave them direct
access to their computer system

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:90%
in order to do this.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
One of their employees
carelessly downloaded something

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:84%
in a phishing scam, which
was they get an email

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:90%
and they click on it.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And the net result was the
hackers now had an access point

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.950 align:middle line:84%
to get into the Target
computer systems

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:84%
literally down at
the store level.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, once you
get into the store level,

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't very long
before they figured out

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:84%
how they could get right down to
the card swipe terminal level.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And at that point they
began gathering, obviously,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
large numbers of credit card
numbers and pin numbers, which

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
was of great concern
to both the banks

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:90%
as well as to major consumers.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
The answer, of course,
security-wise, to all of this,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:84%
was to let's encrypt
literally at the terminal,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and we need to start
swiping turning over

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
cards from the
old magnetic swipe

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:84%
into a more secure
chip, which we actually

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:90%
proposed, I believe, in 1992.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So you can see how
long it's taken.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
The credit card industry
is not all that interested

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:90%
in the security aspects.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:90%
They get to write that off.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, absolutely.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
consumer is the one

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
that ends up paying for it,
both by paying extra fees.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And the flip side is,
if you're the one that

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
got hit with the
credit fraud, you're

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.537 align:middle line:84%
the one that one has to end
up with cleaning up the mess.

00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
federal government

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:84%
is really not interested
in allowing the credit card

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
industry to secure things as
well because they are quite

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
interested in monitoring
the financial track

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:84%
transactions on en mass basis,
usually under the guise of law

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
enforcement or anti-terrorism
or intelligence operations.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
However, sweeping large
amounts of data, as we've seen,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
has been relatively
ineffective in stopping

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
any of the criminal
and/or terrorist elements.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
people these hackers who

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
are hitting commercial
enterprises,

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:90%
are they doing this like 24/7?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:84%
They're just sitting around
at a computer somewhere

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.927 align:middle line:84%
in some country just
trying to get into access?

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they
actually work in teams

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
literally around the
clock on shift basis.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The real professional
gangs actually

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.483 align:middle line:84%
have their own data
centers, supercomputers.

00:07:53.483 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:84%
As you can well tell
with the Target and the--

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.322 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sony.

00:07:59.322 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The Sony hack.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll talk about
Sony in a second here.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:02.321 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
These hacks, in some
cases, can be directed back

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.334 align:middle line:90%
towards government entities.

00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
directed back to

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:90%
professional criminal entities.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a
combination of both,

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
since the criminal entities
can be more or less made

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:84%
into mercenaries depending
on how operations go.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And acting as mercenaries,
they frequently

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
will leave trails
after combat operations

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
to come back and
exploit commercially.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So I reflected upon
this back in the '90s

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:84%
when I looked at an FBI
compatriot and said,

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:84%
listen, you work
40 hours a week.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:84%
You go home and you
knock off for the day.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Your adversary is someone
who has no social life, who

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
would stay up 48, 72 hours even
without going to the bathroom

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
in order to accomplish
what they're doing.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Which one of you do you
think is better equipped

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
to perform an
offensive operation?

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Very clearly, the vested
interests have found this

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and are recruiting
these individuals,

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:84%
not only in the professional
and governmental senses,

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
but as well as in the
criminal enterprise senses.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the Lizard Squad, for
example, who've recently hacked

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Sony and Xbox and others.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They haven't done it
for commercial gain.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:90%
They did it just for fun.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.592 align:middle line:84%
They brought down whole
networks of gaming systems just

00:09:34.592 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:90%
to prove a point.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: During Christmas.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:37.806 align:middle line:90%
Just to prove a point.

00:09:37.806 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Just to be--

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
imagine how many

00:09:39.755 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
fathers unpacked their
Xboxes with a little kid

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
there all excited, and
he tried to hook it up,

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't working
because it was hacked.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And he's probably thinking
he's doing something wrong,

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.370 align:middle line:90%
how has he screwed up?

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And the little kid is crying,
daddy, I want to play.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.060 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do it.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.567 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't find that funny,
but I guess these people do.

00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the other group,

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
for example, Anonymous,
who have been associated

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:84%
both with commercial as well
as non-commercial just plain

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:90%
vandal type of hackings.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who are they?

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You could say that
they're a faceless group

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.856 align:middle line:90%
of individuals.

00:10:20.856 --> 00:10:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know each other?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: In many cases they do.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:90%
They meet personally.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.205 align:middle line:84%
They meet at many of these
computer conventions.

00:10:28.205 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
They even have
conventions of their own.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:84%
The flip side of that is
that some of them don't meet.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have been
recruited or, in some cases,

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:84%
their groups have either
been hijacked and/or employed

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
by government and/or criminal
entities to carry out purposes.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Crime, in a cyber
sense, not only

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
hits you at your credit card
or Christmas morning level--

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or your bank account.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Or your bank account.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
A real good example of a
recent hack-- this was actually

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
on one of your competing
networks-- a couple came home,

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:10.347 align:middle line:84%
and they had to put a nanny
cam up to watch their child.

00:11:10.347 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And while they were
sitting pleasantly

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:84%
in the living room
watching television,

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.190 align:middle line:84%
they heard a voice
that they'd never

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:84%
heard before coming out
of the child's bedroom.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:84%
They walked into the
back and essentially

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
found that someone had
hacked into their nanny cam

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.684 align:middle line:90%
and was essentially cursing--

00:11:27.684 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Talking to the kid.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Talking to
the kid, cursing,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
saying that they were going
to do horrible things.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And was
looking at the kid.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Looking at the kid,
knew their exact address,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.160 align:middle line:90%
knew the child.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Now you've got a real problem.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And the issue here is, in
computer security terms,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:84%
commercially speaking,
most companies

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
aren't really willing to
put this in because it's

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:55.299 align:middle line:90%
an extra expense.

00:11:55.299 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And a good example
is like the couple

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:90%
that shopped for the nanny cam.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
If you have a nanny
cam at $100 that's OK,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.599 align:middle line:84%
and a nanny cam at
$200 that's secure,

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:06.765 align:middle line:90%
which one are you gonna buy?

00:12:06.765 --> 00:12:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And there are no
real requirements for anyone

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:90%
to do these kinds of things.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I put
a piece of tape

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
over the cameras that
are on my laptop and net

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:84%
book, the one that points at
you, just because perhaps I'm

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.870 align:middle line:84%
a little paranoid, or perhaps
I just don't want anybody

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to just happen to be
passing by and take a look

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and try to view me and
find out what I'm doing.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen this get
worse from the point of view,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:84%
for example, a major corporation
represented by a piece of fruit

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
sells a very large
number of cell phones.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:10%
Well, it was
discovered recently,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:10%
within the past year, that
one of the applications

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:10%
that individuals downloaded
officially from them

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:10%
also contained a little back
door that would periodically

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:10%
report on your
exact GPS location

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:10%
while you held that phone.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So why would a major
corporation want

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
to know where you're
at at any given time?

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have the other aspect
of this, the competing nature.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Some people enjoy using the
GPS features of their phone

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:84%
so they can go find where's
the nearest pizza place,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:84%
or where are their
other friends?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hate to break
it to you, but there

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:84%
are people out there
who are monitoring this

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:90%
who also know where you are.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.205 align:middle line:90%
Not a really good thing.

00:13:38.205 --> 00:13:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you get on
your cell phone

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and you text, I'm
going to the store,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll be a couple of hours, and
leave your house or apartment,

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
there might be someone
down the block,

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps not the FBI,
who received that message

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.324 align:middle line:84%
and know exactly who you
are and where you are.

00:13:54.324 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they that
sophisticated, Charles?

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
There are devices
called stingrays.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The FBI is currently using
them, along with the NSA.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.347 align:middle line:84%
Think of them as
mobile cell towers.

00:14:06.347 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've heard about these.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:84%
We've broken some stories
about that on "Coast to Coast."

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You can set them
up, and essentially instead

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
of talking to the
local cell tower,

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
you're now talking
to the stingray.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Everything you
say, everything you

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
do, everything that the device
you carry that communicates

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:84%
about you will go through
the stingray or get

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:90%
picked up by it.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And it could surreptitiously
download things

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:84%
onto your system if
you're not careful.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:84%
These devices are not that
difficult to put together.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Once again, back in the
1990s for a demonstration

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:84%
to a congressman,
I looked at him

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, you know it is
against the law, federal law,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
to have a scanner that
will monitor cell phones.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:84%
However, it's not against
the law to have a cell phone.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult to
modify a cell phone

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:84%
to do exactly the reverse, to
monitor other conversations

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:84%
and/or text messages that
come from other cell phones

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.632 align:middle line:90%
within that cell district.

00:15:09.632 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they want
with all this information?

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
the hackers now.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.600 align:middle line:90%
What are they after here?

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, a
real good example

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.270 align:middle line:84%
is hackers will download, like
in the Target case, millions

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:84%
of credit card numbers
and PIN numbers,

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and then resell them
on the open network

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to others who abuse that
and credit card fraud

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
to buy and get billions of
dollars worth of equipment,

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:84%
make a large amount
of money off of this.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they would
make a purchase somewhere

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and have it shipped somewhere.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's use an example.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Somebody has a stolen
card number and PIN.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:90%
They're online.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:84%
They go to Amazon.com,
for example,

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and they buy as much as
they can up to the credit

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:84%
limit of that credit card before
they start getting denials,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.321 align:middle line:90%
Where do the goods go?

00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What they'll usually
do is ship it to a drop point.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And that can be an apartment
that's for temporary rent,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle line:84%
or a commercial business where
they can walk up and pick up

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.692 align:middle line:84%
the packages and just literally
walk away and no one knows.

00:16:16.692 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:84%
They could even
use the credit card

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
to secure the apartment as
well as the phony credentials

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:90%
along with it.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:84%
It can actually blend from
commercial to military.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Russian military

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:84%
has used stolen
American credit cards

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:84%
to set up hacker sites which
they used against the Ukraine

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and Georgia governments
during the combat operations.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have this fine line no
longer being such a fine line

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:84%
between being a
commercial target,

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
being a civilian target,
being a military target.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And you also have the flip
side, as we've mentioned.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:84%
We've seen, for example, some
of the antiquated problems

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:84%
like with Craigslist,
where we had murderers

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:84%
contacting individuals
for things for sale,

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.512 align:middle line:84%
and then meeting them and
killing the individuals.

00:17:12.512 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just to do it.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.109 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is going to
become some of the norm

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.609 align:middle line:84%
with your cell phone,
with text messaging,

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
with cell phone conversations
with GPS applications.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Those things are going
to migrate into that area

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
as criminals become more
sophisticated and savvy.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.630 align:middle line:84%
We've already seen
these things happen

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
with Internet-based
camera systems which

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:84%
can be on your
computer or set up

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:90%
around your house or business.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a great idea, but
if you don't secure it

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.397 align:middle line:84%
correctly someone else could
be using it against you.

00:17:50.397 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is remarkable.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm amazed at how many, or
the lack of, wrong numbers

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.620 align:middle line:90%
I get on a cell phone.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I would get more on a landline
phone in the old days.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:02.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't get many now.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.984 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:18:04.984 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: One of the
features, especially

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:84%
on my phone, which
I find quite useful,

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
is the auto reject, meaning no
matter what number comes in,

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I can put it on a reject list,
whereas your major landline

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:84%
carriers, if you called
them up and said,

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to receive this
call from XYZ individual,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:84%
they will generally
tell you, well, it's

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
either going to cost you
an awful lot of money,

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.751 align:middle line:90%
or we can't do that.

00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't even know
the originating call sometimes.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, because these
days you can fake calls.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:90%
You obviously get fake numbers.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Again, because of the
merger of Internet

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and computerized networks, the
kind of software and hardware

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:84%
that allows me to
fake a phone number

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and then dial whole area codes
with that fake phone number.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And that phone number can
be just an ordinary person.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.195 align:middle line:84%
And I've already
had that experience.

00:19:02.195 --> 00:19:03.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it shows
up on your phone.

00:19:03.905 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:90%
With their name.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you call
them back and say,

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever want to
hear you calling me

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.454 align:middle line:90%
with this kind of garbage.

00:19:11.454 --> 00:19:12.995 align:middle line:84%
And the other person
at the other end

00:19:12.995 --> 00:19:14.079 align:middle line:90%
is going, what phone call?

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:15.578 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
you talking about?

00:19:15.578 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that's part of
the, again, newer system Skype.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
There are hacks
into that that allow

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
foreign, literally
phone-based operations,

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.200 align:middle line:84%
to generally run
massive database calls.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And the American consumer
is getting pummeled

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:90%
with this on a daily basis.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way to tell
exactly where it came from,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:84%
because by the time
you track it back

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
through all of the
Internet jumps,

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:84%
it could be somewhere
offshore, it

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:90%
could be in a foreign country.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.712 align:middle line:84%
And again, we get
outside of US law,

00:19:50.712 --> 00:19:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that becomes much more difficult
to prosecute and run down.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
interesting you

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:90%
say that, Charles.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
I will sometimes call my
credit card companies.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:84%
What are the dangers
of those people, who

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:84%
we don't know who they are,
giving away your credit card

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:84%
information to friends
or other companies?

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's
already occurred.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the major northeast
banks hired a phone bank.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:84%
The net result was a large
number of their customers,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:84%
their financial accounts
were suddenly hacked.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Large amounts of
money were missing,

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:90%
credit cards were stolen.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was tracked
literally back

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:84%
through their essentially
contracting out this call

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.390 align:middle line:90%
center operation.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It cost them an awful
lot of money to do this.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And we don't necessarily
hear about these things

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
on a major scale because a major
bank or commercial operation

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily want you
to know that this has happened.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:52.180 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty with this is
that as we internationalize,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and in many cases offshore
a lot of these operations,

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
there becomes a problem of
the institutional security.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Even the US government
has found that.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Say, the NSA.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.714 align:middle line:84%
No Such Agency, as we
used to refer to it.

00:21:08.714 --> 00:21:10.880 align:middle line:84%
They don't like to be
publicized, and now that we've

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.607 align:middle line:84%
mentioned them, I'm sure that
Fort Meade will be judiciously

00:21:13.607 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:90%
watching your shows.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:90%
We're now high on their list.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.222 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We knew-- they've told
me that they're fans of yours,

00:21:20.222 --> 00:21:21.930 align:middle line:84%
so they already record
your stuff anyway.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The fact
remains is that if we

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
don't know who
you're dealing with,

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
then you already have
a security problem.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And even though
professionals such as myself,

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:84%
who develop wide varieties of
secure equipment and software

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and extreme security
and encryption systems,

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.462 align:middle line:90%
you can't make it foolproof.

00:21:50.462 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, you can't.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The human element is
always one of the major flaws.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened
with Target.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The human element brought
in an external hacker

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly their entire system
not only became vulnerable,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
millions of their customers
became vulnerable along

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.450 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So it spread from one to many
to millions in a matter of days.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was
the lack of foresight

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.360 align:middle line:84%
on restricting the
kind of access that

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:84%
should have been in place that's
done at the physical security

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I sometimes
wonder if it's

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:84%
the company that makes the
credit card, the physical card,

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
if they're sometimes behind
this, because they're

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:90%
the ones who benefit.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.350 align:middle line:84%
When there's a hacking
worldwide and you

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:51.430 align:middle line:84%
have to order five million
new credit cards or whatever,

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:90%
don't they benefit?

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's an old line
from "The Maltese Falcon" where

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Humphrey Bogart shares a toast
with two other police officers.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And his quote is,
"Success to crime."

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a business,
and without it, they

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be in business, such as
police officers and detectives,

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
to fight it.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
In many cases there are
individuals and/or companies

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.620 align:middle line:84%
who will essentially
break the window in order

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:90%
to come back to fix it.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And there is not a
lot of incentive,

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
for example, with the
credit card industry,

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to make their credit
cards very secure.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even some
of the simple things.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I myself receive blank checks
from my credit card company

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.200 align:middle line:90%
about once every two weeks.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I have called them
up repeatedly,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:84%
asked for whoever
in your marketing,

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:84%
please do not send these to me
because they sit in my mailbox.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.255 align:middle line:84%
Anyone could pull that
out, sign my name on it--

00:23:59.255 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And cash it.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And cash it.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they give
me plenty excuses,

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:84%
but they continue
to send the checks.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
It is in their interest to have
fraud continue to take place

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:84%
because they still
garnish, get that 1% or 2%

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:90%
that are legitimate.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So again, if the cost is
not on them-- in essence,

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
most of the cost is on
you and the consumer--

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and if it doesn't
cost them anything,

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
meaning they can hike your rate
if it does cost them something,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.820 align:middle line:84%
then they have no
incentive whatsoever

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:90%
to change their ways.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
It's only when you make
it unprofitable for them.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we were to
fine credit card companies

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
every time that
they get breached,

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:84%
suddenly you would see a major
effort to stop the problem.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And that would be done at the
commercial terminal basis,

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:90%
like we saw with Target.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Their terminals were
completely wide open

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.750 align:middle line:90%
to their local system.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Home Depot
got hit the same way.

00:25:01.475 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.265 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, as soon
as you swipe the card,

00:25:04.265 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:84%
the information was
available to their system,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:84%
which then encrypted
it and sent it

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:90%
to the credit card processor.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:84%
What they needed
to do was literally

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.700 align:middle line:84%
encrypt the data at the
credit card terminal

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and have it piggybacked
through their system

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:90%
directly to the banks.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can this
be stopped, Charles?

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And I can point to one entity
who has literally walked

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:84%
above all of this for many
years, the Federal Reserve

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Bank.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve
Bank, in many cases,

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.240 align:middle line:90%
doesn't garner a lot of trust.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But in my field, the Federal
Reserve Bank probably

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.010 align:middle line:84%
has the best encryption
security systems

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:84%
in the world, military
notwithstanding.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But anybody could
follow that game plan, right,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:90%
and encrypt the same way.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY:But they won't.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Money?

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's not
in their interest,

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
as long as they don't
have any real reason to.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:90%
The Federal Reserve Bank does.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
They transfer nearly $2 trillion
a day through the banks.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
If someone was to break into
that, there'd be a problem.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A huge problem.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I
have, for example,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
met with Alan Greenspan, the
old chairman of the Reserve.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Head of the fed, right.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: When the NSA
walked into his office

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:84%
once and said, we would
like to have a back door

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:84%
to monitor transactions,
he literally

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:84%
threw the NSA
agents out the door,

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:84%
ordered security to escort
them from the building

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and not ever let
them back in time.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is,
the answer is no.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't need
access, and we also

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
know what can happen
if we give you access.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.450 align:middle line:10%
And as we've seen with
Snowden, and as we've

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.940 align:middle line:10%
seen with several Russian agents
and many of the intelligence

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:10%
agencies if they get
ahold of these main keys,

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:10%
there is trouble.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:10%
And if you had, say, the keys
to the entire financial global

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.122 align:middle line:10%
system of the Federal
Reserve Bank--

00:27:08.122 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're golden.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Charles, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:10%
Fascinating how
hackers are breaking

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:10%
into all kinds of
systems worldwide.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.740 align:middle line:10%
Wait'll you hear Charles R.
Smith on our next episode

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:40.757 align:middle line:90%
