00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.870 align:middle line:10%
Since she was 15 years
old, John Greenewald Jr.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.260 align:middle line:84%
has been accumulating all
kinds of documents related

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
to UFOs and possible
UFO visitations

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:90%
that the government has had.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:10%
He's accumulated them and
put them into his website

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:10%
called The Black Vault. John,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN GREENEWALD:
Thank you, George.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.651 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did a
little 15-year-old

00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:43.275 align:middle line:84%
get involved in
doing all of this?

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:45.816 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: You know, I wish
I had a better answer for you.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:10%
It was just simply curiosity.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
As a 15-year-old kid, I wanted
to know what was out there.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.345 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I wanted
to see what was online.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:10%
The internet was, kind
of, in its budding stages,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:10%
but I used the search engine,
looked for UFO information,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:10%
and found the same
stories over and over.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.914 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, well, this
isn't working for me.

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know what the
government connection was.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I taught myself how to use the
Freedom of Information Act,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and here we are,
nearly 21 years later.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you didn't
do any hacking, did you?

00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: No,
no, it was all legal,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- most of
the people that walk around

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:84%
everyday don't realize
that we can access

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:90%
this information legally.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to do
anything illegal,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:84%
hack, or get something
leaked to us.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the truth is
stranger than fiction.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is, the government

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
will actually give
you information.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to believe some
computer hacker in Bulgaria

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:90%
that got this information.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
This is something that the
CIA or the NSA or whomever

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.177 align:middle line:90%
will actually hand to you.

00:01:44.177 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you started
getting the information,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.902 align:middle line:84%
were you surprised about this
UFO-government connection?

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I
was very surprised.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:84%
The big picture, you'd think,
with the US government--

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
deny everything,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
or there's just simply
nothing to be found.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.680 align:middle line:10%
On the contrary, there were
thousands of pages to be found,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.430 align:middle line:10%
and those thousands of pages
were detailing UFO sightings

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:10%
that-- here we are, well
into the 21st century--

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:10%
we cannot explain.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, some were from the
'40s, '50s, and '60s,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:90%
and that's all interesting.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But what fascinated me was stuff
from the '70s, '80s, and '90s,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:84%
the stuff that came well after
the United States military

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
said we investigated these
things and found nothing.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Move along.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet, behind the scenes,
the Freedom of Information Act

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
has told us, there is a lot more
that they don't want us to see.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more going
on behind the scenes

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
that they just simply
do not talk about.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.437 align:middle line:90%
But the documents will tell us.

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were some of these
documents blacked out,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
so you're reading them,
and you're coming up

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
to some great material,
and then, all of a sudden,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.265 align:middle line:90%
it's all blacked out?

00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:50.306 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And In some cases
you get entire pages

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
that are blacked out--
literally, top to bottom.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why cut down the tree
to send these documents out?

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why send them out?

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.006 align:middle line:84%
Now, some agencies
don't, but others do.

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And you get these
things, and they're

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:90%
blacked out from top to bottom.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty amazing find on
a topic that's, quote unquote,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
easily explainable or a
phenomenon that doesn't exist.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes,
you'll find names

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:84%
or personal identifying
information,

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and that's exempted through
the Freedom of Information Act.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's something you
commonly see blacked out.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm talking
about is literally

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
big paragraphs, big
chunks of information that

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:90%
are just completely omitted.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:84%
That's a threat to
national security.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:10%
If they said, well,
here, George, we

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:10%
want you to read
this, that would be

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:10%
a threat to national security.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So then, I ask
the question, what

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
is that threat to
national security

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking
about the UFO phenomenon?

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Again-- a phenomenon
that shouldn't exist.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion, is the
UFO-government situation still

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:90%
continuing?

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.389 align:middle line:84%
Are we still probing and
investigating these cases?

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: I think so.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I think there's still a
behind-the-scenes interest

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:90%
in this material.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
I discovered a United States Air
Force manual, the same agency

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that loves to say, we
investigated these things,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing to find.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
A US Air Force manual that
had black-and-white proof

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:84%
that they were still
collecting UFO reports.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I got a major
mainstream media organization

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
to do a story on this, and they
made a phone call to the US Air

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.695 align:middle line:84%
Force and inquired
about this manual--

00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:27.947 align:middle line:84%
it's called Air
Force Manual 10-206--

00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gosh, you
know 'em all, John.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, this
was a big one for me.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't forget this one,
because unidentified flying

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.050 align:middle line:84%
objects was, again,
black-and-white in this thing.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force did not
call this media agency back.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And after two days, I get
a call from the journalist

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:90%
who was doing this story.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
He goes back on, and not only
did I have the documents,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
but I actually showed him how to
download it from the Air Force.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you can believe it, it was
like hiding it in plain sight.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
This was proof that they
were investigating UFOs.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:84%
He goes back to
download it again,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:84%
because he was
finishing up the story,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and the manual was
completely changed.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:90%
He calls me.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:90%
I thought he made a mistake.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I go on, and sure
enough, within 36 hours

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
of his initial inquiry,
the United States Air Force

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
completely removed the entire
chapter on UFOs, rewrote it,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and it was something
else entirely.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And I did subsequent
FOIA requests

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:84%
to try and figure
out what happened.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.020 align:middle line:84%
They truly did change it
within 36 hours of the media

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:90%
asking the question.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:90%
It was like they covered it up.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.962 align:middle line:84%
Their official explanation
was, it was a coincidence.

00:05:35.962 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, what are the odds?

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we know there
are no coincidences, John.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.476 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly.

00:05:39.476 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And plus, this is the
United States military.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:84%
The United States government
does not do things quickly.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So for them to do this
on the fly like that,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:90%
that's a pretty big coincidence.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
knew that there was

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:90%
going to be a profile on this.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:84%
It was irrefutable
proof they were lying--

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
didn't think anybody

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.120 align:middle line:90%
would spot it or see it.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.953 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Right.

00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But now we did, and they
thought, OK, well, we've

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:90%
got to cover this up.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And they took it out and claimed
that it's no longer there.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:84%
They had multiple
opportunities to remove that.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Some might say, well,
it was a coincidence.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But actually, there's-- like
you said-- no coincidences.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
They had multiple
opportunities to revise it,

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.629 align:middle line:84%
and they would revise the
manual, but UFO stayed in it.

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
They only removed it when
the media asked the question.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there newer cases
still coming and new documents

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:90%
still forthcoming?

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.366 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, it's
been a little bit harder,

00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
because I've tackled nearly
every agency out there--

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.242 align:middle line:84%
arguably, all of them
trying to find information--

00:06:40.242 --> 00:06:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Including the
Forestry Service, right?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.783 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, and that was
one agency that actually just

00:06:44.783 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:84%
came out with some
UFO-related documents.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
It was an agency I had
never really hit before.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
even think about that?

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I really
thought it was a long shot.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect anything.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:90%
I filed a FOIA request.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, I
get this response.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I opened it up, and there
were color photographs

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:90%
of a UFO sighting.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's very rare.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.830 align:middle line:90%
What did it look like?

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, it's,
kind of, what you see.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
When somebody reports a UFO and
they have a cell phone video

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
camera or something
like that, where

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:84%
they take a picture of
an object in the sky--

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
the story was very similar
to what you read today, where

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:90%
they were not out hunting UFOs.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:90%
They were simply camping.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And they were out, and they
took a photograph of one

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
of the people sitting
on a rock, got back,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
downloaded the digital
photos to their laptop,

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.746 align:middle line:84%
and behind them was
this UFO in the sky.

00:07:38.746 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And they sent it to
the Forest Service.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
What I can't really deduce is if
this was a civilian or possibly

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.350 align:middle line:90%
a forest service personnel--

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:90%
They don't say.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:90%
They don't write that down.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.713 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, because
they black it all out.

00:07:48.713 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit hard
to figure that part out.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, they're taking
these things seriously.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
There are craft in the sky
that they just can't identify,

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:84%
whether it be in a
major booming city

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.715 align:middle line:84%
or whether it be in
a forest somewhere.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
These things are
being seen everywhere,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.995 align:middle line:84%
and seemingly, the government
is taking it seriously.

00:08:06.995 --> 00:08:08.869 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Based on looking
at these documents,

00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:84%
since you were 15
years old, have

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:84%
you come to your own conclusions
on just what's going on?

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I very much approach
it with what

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:90%
I call the common sense way.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, I, kind of, step
to being a full believer.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So in my step
process, I think it's

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:84%
very easy to determine that
the UFO cover-up is real,

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:90%
and it's going on to this day.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:84%
This is not something that
goes back five or six decades.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
This is something that the
military and the government

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:84%
do not want us to know
about, even to this day.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a conclusion
that I can safely draw.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Is it alien-related?

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I'm
the type of person,

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
personally, that needs
to see to believe.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.979 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen an
alien, so I don't know.

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not
from Missouri, are you?

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.353 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I'm
not. (CHUCKLING) No.

00:08:53.353 --> 00:08:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But you have to draw
your own conclusions

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.230 align:middle line:90%
from these top-secret records.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And in my personal
opinion, the phenomenon

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:90%
is real, whatever it may be.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.379 align:middle line:90%
The cover-up is undeniable.

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:10%
Because I mean, I could bore
you to death for hours and hours

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:10%
on these thousands
of pages that prove

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:10%
that that cover-up is real.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:90%
But then, the question is, why?

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's top-secret
military aircraft or something

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
we can easily
explain, skeptics love

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, that's testing
new aircraft here, there,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But the military itself
would be able to identify it.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.656 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: When I
request information

00:09:31.656 --> 00:09:35.930 align:middle line:84%
on unidentified flying objects,
the material that comes up

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
is unidentified to the
military and the government.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:90%
That's undeniable.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:84%
So the question mark is,
what is it, alien-related?

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:84%
You start tackling every
explanation possible.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
only ones that's left.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know that you're

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:84%
getting the information
you've requested?

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:84%
How do you know they're
not holding back documents?

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: It's
blind trust and faith.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
does that tell you?

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: That's right.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're dealing with the
government and the military.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And time and time
again, they've been

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:84%
proven to either make
an oops mistake or lie,

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:90%
however you want to label it.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But they overlook things,
they make mistakes,

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
they claim certain
things don't exist.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And as a citizen,
I can't just say,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:84%
well, I think you're
lying, so look again.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I can appeal their decision,
meaning, if they say,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:84%
well, we've got nothing
on this, I can appeal it.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But I have to have
grounds for an appeal.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.246 align:middle line:84%
If I just say, well,
I think you're lying,

00:10:32.246 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to do anything.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have a little
bit of trust and faith

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:84%
that whomever is processing your
request on the other side is

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:90%
actually doing their job.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yet--

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: That's
tough sometimes.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.206 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet some
of the documents

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
will merely disappear, like
they did at an Air Force base.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.590 align:middle line:10%
- On August 1st, 1965, a
dramatic large-scale UFO

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:10%
incursion took place at F.
E. Warren Air Force Base

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
in Wyoming, as this
declassified report confirms.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Dozens of sightings of
disc-shaped craft cavorting

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:84%
at low altitude over Minuteman
missile silos known as launch

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
facilities, were reported
by the Air Force security

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:90%
personnel guarding them.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.540 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.915 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was dramatic,
as all get-up, John.

00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:90%
My God.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: That's
a big question.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And you've got not only
this particular case

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
but quite a few others
where UFOs appear

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:90%
over nuclear installations.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.820 align:middle line:84%
They seemingly interact
with the silos.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, there
are eyewitnesses

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.230 align:middle line:84%
stating that whatever
these UFOs are,

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
they're strategically
shutting down--

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
good eyewitnesses, too.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.071 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: And they're good.

00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:90%
They're reliable.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
that, and you realize

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
there is a connection,
whatever it might be,

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:84%
between these UFO cases
and nuclear installations.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of, kind of,
thinking through a little bit

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:84%
of all of these past
cases, I thought

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
to fire a Freedom
of Information Act

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
request to what's called the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:90%
or the NRC and ask them--

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the watchdog.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.106 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly--
to see what kind

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.480 align:middle line:84%
of UFO information,
if any, they had.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Because if there was
this UFO connection,

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:90%
that would be the place to go.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And to my surprise, I
got a stack of documents

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:84%
just in the last
couple of months,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84%
where they detail one
particular security guard.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:10%
He recalls, in the late 1980s,
at Cooper Nuclear Station,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:10%
he saw a UFO come down.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:10%
He watched it for a
short period of time

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.849 align:middle line:10%
and had an eyewitness with him.

00:12:37.849 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
He goes back and tells
the other security guards.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:84%
They laughed at him and said,
no, you didn't see that.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, to his surprise, he
went out the next night

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and, sure enough,
it was there again.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.091 align:middle line:84%
And he saw the
UFO a second time.

00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:84%
He goes in and he gets
all those guys that

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.402 align:middle line:84%
laughed at him,
brought them all out,

00:12:55.402 --> 00:12:57.235 align:middle line:84%
and sure enough, they

He did not report it at all.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And just in the last
5, 6 years, he decides,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, I should make
a report of this.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:90%
And he goes back to the NRC.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.420 align:middle line:90%
He's retired.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:84%
He goes back to the
NRC and actually makes

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:90%
an official report.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.600 align:middle line:84%

the agencies do not care.

>>GREENEWALD: And
yet-- there you go.

00:13:26.851 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And the NRC took his
report seriously.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
They sent it to
the nuclear station

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:90%
on a need-to-know basis.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:84%
They said, do not
circulate this report.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Only give it to those that
have a need to know, which--

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:84%
why would you have that kind
of stipulation on something

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:90%
like this--

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:90%
that happened 20, 25 years ago?

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And there, the report
went off to the station.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.340 align:middle line:84%
No follow up, no response-- at
least, none that they gave me.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But this was a brand
new UFO experience

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and case where it had
never been released before,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and it came out straight from
the United States government.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So whatever that connection
is, it's still a question mark.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.366 align:middle line:84%
But you can definitely see
a connection between UFOs

00:14:09.366 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:90%
and these nuclear stations.

will shut these silos down

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and will turn them

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:84%

Who are they?

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.941 align:middle line:84%
Are they another country that's
now capable of coming here?

00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Do they have technology
that we're not aware of?

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
it's another country.

>>GREENEWALD: I don't
think so either.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.906 align:middle line:84%
But you have to tackle
that possibility--

00:14:49.906 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
have to rule it out.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.363 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Right.

00:14:52.363 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But you start realizing,
OK, common sense tells us,

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.764 align:middle line:84%
there is no country close to
having that type of technology.

00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And if they did, they wouldn't
be in the heart of America.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there
are some people

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:84%
who theorize that these are
coming from the inner planet,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.952 align:middle line:84%
from a very advanced race of
humans who live down there.

>>GREENEWALD: That's
a possibility.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what kind of
story you want to follow.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm along
the belief system

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that if these things are
not us, meaning humans

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:84%
that live on the
planetary surface,

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:90%
then it's out there somewhere.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And the question mark is,
why are they coming here,

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:90%
and what are they looking for?

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it a coincidence that they
are found above nuclear--

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No coincidences.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: No coincidences.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.519 align:middle line:84%
So you have to use common
sense and say, OK, well,

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:90%
what are they doing here then--

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:90%

>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have a lot of
fun being on camera.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:84%

young, being interviewed

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
for the History Channel
and Discovery Channel type

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.680 align:middle line:90%
networks.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.190 align:middle line:84%
But I fell in love with the way
television was made, you know.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was 18 when I
first did my first interview.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And not to be cheesy
about it, I just

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
loved everything-- the
camera, the lighting.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was a
sense of magic to it.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And to most viewing
audiences, they

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:84%
know there's a magic
there, but that's

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.190 align:middle line:84%

interest grows--

>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to actually
do it and make it.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.135 align:middle line:84%
And so I started creating
shows for History Channel.

00:16:27.135 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:84%
That was my first big
run-- and to my surprise,

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:84%
selling the idea as though
we were coming up with.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I got to be a
producer and worked my way up

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.190 align:middle line:84%
as a supervising producer,
director, writer--

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.191 align:middle line:84%
whichever comes my
way-- janitor if that--

00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd do
whatever you have to do.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.815 align:middle line:84%

I just love working,

grown over the years.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:84%
We had a blast every
season, and I think

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:90%
they're done at least for now.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I know that you can
view it online and--

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of them
have a life to it.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But again, it shows that
people just have this interest.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And what was fun about Unsealed
versus a lot of the other shows

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that you see on
television now is

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that it was a lot less reality
and more so just storytelling.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.705 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Now, I've
worked on reality television,

00:19:37.705 --> 00:19:39.597 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going
to trash it, but I

00:19:39.597 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
would like to see a lot
more of that storytelling,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
because I think that's
what people want.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, UFO
research is just not

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
that exciting to be
in the moment with us

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.670 align:middle line:90%
as we're doing it.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.266 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
line, the end of the story,

00:19:52.266 --> 00:19:53.890 align:middle line:84%
that's the interesting
part, and that's

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
what I think we need
a little bit more

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:84%
of in television--
and conversations

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
like this with Beyond Belief,
where you don't have the fluff.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
You just have dialogue,
ask those questions,

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, maybe have a
few answers along the way.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
get to a point where

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
you think Hollywood or
Hollywood producers are fudging

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
UFO information
because the government

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.549 align:middle line:90%
might be pressuring them?

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: There's a
big conspiracy out there,

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:84%
which I've been attacked
with quite a few times

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:90%
by the public--

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
which is, there's
this conspiracy

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
to hold the real UFO
information, that

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
damning evidence that, if
it was put on television,

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
all heck would break
loose around the globe.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we're part
of the conspiracy

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:84%
as producers and writers-- that
we're part of the cover up.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to tell you after
all the shows I've ever done,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.817 align:middle line:84%
I've never had somebody tell
me, oh, you can't say that.

00:20:46.817 --> 00:20:48.025 align:middle line:90%
You're going into territory--

00:20:48.025 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same with me.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.002 align:middle line:90%
Same with me and the radio show.

00:20:50.002 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: As
long as you-- what

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.835 align:middle line:84%
I've learned with
the executives,

00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:84%
the big guys that are
much smarter than me,

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:90%
is that they want a good story.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's all they want.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
They want you to
tell a good story.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes, producers want
to tell a very skeptical story,

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and one that destroys UFO
research rather than helps it.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, that's not a
cover-up or conspiracy.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:84%
That's just ignorance on
the part of the producer,

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:84%
because they just
want to destroy it.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.724 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe
in it, so that

00:21:16.724 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:84%
means that no one else can,
and so they destroy it.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.314 align:middle line:84%
So that's not part
of a cover-up.

00:21:20.314 --> 00:21:23.957 align:middle line:84%
I think that's just a
producer that has an agenda.

00:21:23.957 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:84%
But as long as you
tell a good story--

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:84%
we've gotten some great
stories on television before--

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:84%
stuff with trace evidence,
scientific facts that could not

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.060 align:middle line:84%
be denied, that supported
that this UFO phenomenon was

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.732 align:middle line:84%
real and quite possibly
connected to extraterrestrials.

00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of disclosure?

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I keep going
at it with Gaia's

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.294 align:middle line:90%
David Wilcock about disclosure.

00:21:45.294 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
He thinks it's going
to happen, and he's

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:90%
talked about some scenarios.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:90%
They haven't occurred yet.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're going to
get that kind of disclosure

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:90%
from government.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: No
argument from me.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
going to happen either.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:90%
You know, pop culture--

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would
have by now, if--

00:21:59.969 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: I think so.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think
the shroud of secrecy

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:84%
is getting heavier in
covering everything up,

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:84%
versus prepping
us for disclosure.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
the government

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.222 align:middle line:90%
is going to come clean.

00:22:14.222 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's
for the reason we think,

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:84%
where it would scare
society or panic people,

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:90%
although that is a possibility.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I think the bigger possibility,
what's more plausible to

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:84%
me is that the government
just doesn't have the answer.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
there's collusion

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:84%
between extraterrestrials
and the government

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
working underground

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:34.840 align:middle line:90%
in some secret base.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I think quite possibly, the US
government just has no idea,

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.974 align:middle line:84%
and that we are not
superior when it comes

00:22:40.974 --> 00:22:41.890 align:middle line:90%
to an inter-galactic--

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:42.931 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, far from it.

00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD:
--interplanetary scale,

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and that we can't combat
them if they are dangerous.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I just did a show for
History Channel, which was

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:90%
all about the end of the world.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And one particular scenario
they had asked me to do

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
was, if aliens attack,
how would they do it?

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very serious,
scientific look on,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.024 align:middle line:84%
if aliens come here and
they're aggressive--

00:23:07.024 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Independence Day,
all over again, isn't it?

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.023 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Right.

00:23:10.023 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that
science fiction--

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.440 align:middle line:84%
you know, we go to the movies
and we see those blockbusters.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:84%
But we realize,
science fiction is not

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
all that far off from the
truth and from reality.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was a blast of a show
to work on-- pardon the pun--

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.600 align:middle line:90%
this alien race coming down.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think it reinforced
my belief in the fact

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that the US government
just quite possibly

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:84%
has no idea what's out there,
or no idea how to deal with it.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself is your
national security threat.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:84%
That the United States
government has never said,

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle line:90%
we just don't have any idea--

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we can't stop it.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.843 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: --and we
can't stop it, right?

00:23:48.843 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:84%
That would create
that public panic.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physicist
Stephen Hawking says, you

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
ought to be very careful letting
them know that we are here.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How come?

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, you
don't know their intentions.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.022 align:middle line:84%
And again, I keep
calling it my--

00:24:03.022 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
just the way I look at
it with the common sense

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:90%
way, which is--

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, instead of thinking
like this with the universe,

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:90%
think like this with the Earth.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And not everybody
lives in harmony.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.660 align:middle line:84%
We know that more
now than ever, where

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:84%
countries want to destroy
someone else or somewhere else.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:84%
They want to wipe certain
places off the map.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I think
we have to look at this--

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that if we do have a
universe teaming with life

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.750 align:middle line:90%
and it is intelligent--

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.126 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
both agree we do.

00:24:32.126 --> 00:24:34.083 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, and
I think scientifically,

00:24:34.083 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:90%
mathematically, we do.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:36.420 align:middle line:90%
That's easy.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
If it's out there, chances
are, they're not all angelic,

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.280 align:middle line:84%
peace-loving,
dove-releasing societies

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.720 align:middle line:90%
that want to come and save us.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're like us.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Very much so.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
kill, they destroy.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.166 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly.

00:24:49.166 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
nature of humanity.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:84%
You look at it from the smallest
ant in the middle of the Sahara

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the
biggest creatures on Earth--

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:57.612 align:middle line:90%
they fight.

00:24:57.612 --> 00:24:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
no way around it.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence does
not bring peace.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence seemingly
brings more war.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:84%
As we get smarter and our
technology gets bigger,

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:84%
we have more conflict
around the world.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think that--
for me, anyway,

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:84%
it's silly to think that an
intelligent civilization that

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
has a million-year head
start is going to want

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:90%

No.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, nobody
really cares.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:84%
I like ants and I would care,
but the vast majority of people

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:90%
don't.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.555 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's how
we have to look at it,

00:25:46.555 --> 00:25:48.930 align:middle line:90%
on a big intergalactic scale--

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that they don't come
here to save us.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that they're
coming here to survive.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason, they're
coming here possibly to live.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they need something.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the-- you
know, fill in the blank.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to survival, I think

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.090 align:middle line:84%
humanity would do
anything, and that

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.710 align:middle line:90%
would include being aggressive.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%

true for alien life out there.

Bill Clinton at the time,

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:90%

look, what do we know?

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:84%
We know now, we live in an
ever-expanding universe.

We know that there are
billions of stars and planets,

We know from our
fancy telescopes

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that just in the last two
years, more than 20 planets

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:84%
have been identified outside
our solar system that

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:84%
seem to be far enough away from
their suns and dense enough

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
that they might be able to
support some form of life.

the UFO phenomenon,

well, the Clintons

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:84%
have this inherent
interest in UFOs

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and that if they got back
in office with Hillary

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:84%
as president, quite
possibly, that

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:84%
would be the

happening, because there

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:84%
is a wild assumption here
based on that belief,

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and that wild assumption
is that the United States

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:90%

There were a few.

I think Richard Nixon
was one of them.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I think Eisenhower might
have known something.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.841 align:middle line:90%

00:28:22.841 --> 00:28:24.215 align:middle line:84%

is being in the spotlight.

But I think there's also
something else that's

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
very interesting that
many people forget,

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and this, kind of, ties into
when Hillary Clinton addressed

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:84%
it and said that she would take
it seriously and look into it.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.124 align:middle line:84%
UFO believers, at
least some of them--

00:28:55.124 --> 00:28:56.540 align:middle line:84%
maybe a small
percentage-- doesn't

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.550 align:middle line:84%
matter-- for some UFO
believers, that is

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:90%
the only topic they care about.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't care about
North Korea or wars

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.180 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East or whatever.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
They care about-- well,
if the person I vote for

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.600 align:middle line:84%
is going to release UFO
information, that's the key.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a vote.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So if they went on there and
laughed and made fun of it,

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.530 align:middle line:84%
you're going to lose a certain
percentage of society that

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:84%
says, well, I believe
in UFOs, I saw a UFO,

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.530 align:middle line:84%
or I watch George Noory and
listen to him every night,

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.097 align:middle line:90%
and I believe.

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:27.430 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to laugh at me?

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not going
to vote for you.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's a key
piece that I think

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
many people are forgetting--
that they're talking

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.625 align:middle line:90%
about this on a serious level.

don't care, but I'm

saying they care
about those votes

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.930 align:middle line:84%
probably a little
bit more, and they

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.157 align:middle line:90%
and we cannot stop it--

00:31:26.157 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:84%
that scares the living daylights
out of a lot of people.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Because even if they
said in disclosure,

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.890 align:middle line:84%
we know aliens are real,
but that's all we know--

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:37.682 align:middle line:84%
we've seen them light
years away from us--

00:31:37.682 --> 00:31:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've got an
incredible propulsion system.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:40.723 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Right.

00:31:40.723 --> 00:31:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say
they just gave you

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:84%
that little light at the end
of the tunnel to believe.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.430 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the
public will do the rest.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.160 align:middle line:84%
The public will just say,
look at the abduction stories,

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.665 align:middle line:84%
I'm abducted next,
they're coming after me,

00:31:54.665 --> 00:31:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to do
strange science experiments.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:00.647 align:middle line:84%
So it opens up a whole new
dialogue and a whole new fear.

00:32:00.647 --> 00:32:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And all the government
did was say, well, we

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.730 align:middle line:84%
think there is intelligent
life out there.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.754 align:middle line:84%
If disclosure is that
small, then the public

00:32:07.754 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is just going to
fill out the rest

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:90%
and that, again, is that threat.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's one
of the main plausible reasons

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.930 align:middle line:84%
that the government can't
talk about it, at least

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:84%
on a serious note
where they say,

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.070 align:middle line:84%
we believe alien life is out
there and it's intelligent.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.020 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it or
we know it's there.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many television
shows and movies

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
portray ET life, some in
a fun and whimsical way,

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and some in a very
serious way as well.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:84%
My favorite of all
time was on television.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.787 align:middle line:90%
"My Favorite Martian."

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.790 align:middle line:90%
- What's wrong, Officer?

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.140 align:middle line:90%
- Well, I'll tell you.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:10%
This parking meter and I
have a working agreement.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.890 align:middle line:84%
When it puts up its little
red flag, I write a ticket.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.555 align:middle line:90%
You are over-parked.

00:33:04.555 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.241 align:middle line:84%
- Aren't you being
a little hasty?

00:33:13.241 --> 00:33:16.050 align:middle line:84%
- If you're trying to
talk a civil servant out

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:19.990 align:middle line:84%
of a sworn duty, you're talking
to the wrong stone wall.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.425 align:middle line:84%
- I was just trying to prevent
a miscarriage of justice.

00:33:23.225 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.110 align:middle line:90%
That was fun.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was fun, but
there was a little serious tone

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:90%
to that, too.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:33.270 align:middle line:84%
There are some that believe that
even though that was fiction,

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.300 align:middle line:84%
there are aliens
walking among us.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And although that's not--

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Far-fetched, isn't it?

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, that's
not what I personally believe.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think that, again,
looking at it on a global scale,

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
just here on Earth, we
send spies in all the time.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.880 align:middle line:84%
If we were able to take
a spy, go back in time,

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and look at the caveman days,
or go back thousands of years,

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.550 align:middle line:84%
would we do it and
walk among them

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and try and blend
in just to learn?

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:90%
And I think we would.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's my point?

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:07.290 align:middle line:84%
If a civilization out there
has a million-year head start

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:08.090 align:middle line:90%
on us--

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Assuming growth
is at the same level.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: --at the same
level, and scientifically,

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:15.870 align:middle line:84%
they evolve in the same
or similar fashion.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.550 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
any record of where

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:84%
they were a million years
prior, and we are the cavemen.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.650 align:middle line:90%
What would they do?

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think as we
reach to the stars

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and we're putting
rovers here and cameras

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:30.060 align:middle line:84%
there and new space-based
telescopes, we are watching,

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:90%
because we want to learn.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And you know, as far-fetched
as that theory is

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's not one I buy into, I
think it's definitely possible

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.090 align:middle line:84%
that if there is a
civilization out there,

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.639 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking
back in time at us.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.409 align:middle line:84%
And then, if they're
able to come here,

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:46.230 align:middle line:84%
we may not be at that
intellectual level

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:50.534 align:middle line:84%
to understand that this race
has a million-year head start.

00:34:50.534 --> 00:34:52.409 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of people that wouldn't

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.239 align:middle line:90%
be able to handle that.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:84%
They might be intelligent
enough to know that and realize,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:84%
we just need to blend in,
and let's go walk among them

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and learn, because that
is our written record

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.700 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have on whatever
planet 60 light years away

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:90%
from us.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's far-fetched,
but it sounds

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.230 align:middle line:90%
like something we would do.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.970 align:middle line:84%
We're doing it all
the time, and we're

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:84%
doing it right now with robots
and sending probes and so on.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But as we excel, if we
find life out there,

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.150 align:middle line:84%
you better believe
we're going to go watch.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.358 align:middle line:90%
We're going to learn from it.

00:35:22.358 --> 00:35:24.120 align:middle line:84%
It'll probably be
microbial at first,

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.220 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless, that's
what we're going to do.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.930 align:middle line:84%
When we find
intelligent life, are we

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.721 align:middle line:84%
going to go down and
knock them on the head

00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:31.170 align:middle line:90%
and say, hello, we're here?

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I think we would probably
sit back, watch, and learn.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like those
tribes in the Amazon.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they might
say, it's about time.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's about time.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What took you so long?

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at the
tribes in the Amazon--

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they're sending
drones over these rain forests

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that humans really
haven't gone over yet,

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.510 align:middle line:84%
but yet, they find
a group of tribesmen

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that have lived there
for however long,

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:58.950 align:middle line:84%
but we had never
discovered them before.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't go and
communicate with them.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.798 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's how we have

00:36:02.798 --> 00:36:04.530 align:middle line:90%
to look at intelligent life.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we do that?

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Because they have their society.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at
this drone in the sky

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:90%
and throwing arrows at it.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:84%
You look at that, and
you go, how fascinating

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:14.910 align:middle line:90%
is that, really?

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the intelligent--
well, I shouldn't say that.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.980 align:middle line:84%
The technological
gap-- not intelligent,

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.890 align:middle line:84%
but the technological gap--
between that society and this--

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.510 align:middle line:90%
they think it's the gods.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.210 align:middle line:84%
In World War II, that's what
happened in some of the islands

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that we put some of
our equipment on.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: The
tribes on those islands

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.733 align:middle line:84%
thought that they were the
gods that were bringing

00:36:33.733 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:90%
this amazing equipment.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, I think when
you go back to Ancient Greece

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about Zeus
and those kinds of gods,

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
they were talking

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.970 align:middle line:84%
about an extraterrestrial
presence.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:50.250 align:middle line:84%
When you have that kind
of intelligence gap,

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.980 align:middle line:84%
technological gap,
or scientific gap,

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.820 align:middle line:84%
you can't help but get
into that godly mindset,

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.900 align:middle line:84%
where-- well, this isn't a human
from a 1,000 years from now.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.980 align:middle line:84%
This has to be godly,
because we can't do this.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, we can't
fly in the sky.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:90%
We can't go to the moon.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're a history of
can'ts, and yet we keep doing

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that we
have to really consider

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.270 align:middle line:84%
how we look at that
technological gap between us

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and a society in the
middle of the Amazon,

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.940 align:middle line:84%
versus an alien race
out there and us.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're closer to that
tribe in the Amazon,

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:84%
versus a civilization that
has a million-year head start.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.614 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't surprise me
that they haven't come here

00:37:31.614 --> 00:37:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and knocked us on the head
and said, we're above you

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:90%
and we're watching you.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.230 align:middle line:84%
We want you to get rid
of your nuclear weapons

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.790 align:middle line:90%
because we care about you.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I just don't think
that that will happen.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, of all the
documents that you've looked

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:90%
at--

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:84%
of all the documents
you looked at,

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is there anything
there that you would

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.910 align:middle line:84%
say is so compelling to
lead us into the direction

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.700 align:middle line:90%
that we are being visited?

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I wouldn't say
there's one single smoking gun.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.650 align:middle line:84%
For me, I look at
it as a big picture,

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a
big puzzle to me.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And you have to put a couple
of pages and documents together

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:09.150 align:middle line:84%
to realize that this isn't as
easily explainable as they want

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
us to believe, and that the
extraterrestrial presence,

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.350 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it's here,
that's, kind of, one

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.720 align:middle line:90%
of the only explanations left.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Because if you sit down
with a skeptic and they say,

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.565 align:middle line:84%
well, you know,
so-and-so saw this UFO,

00:38:23.565 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is what it
looks like, they'll

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.500 align:middle line:84%
have their laundry
list of explanations.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you try
and match up those

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.330 align:middle line:84%
very common skeptical
explanations for what

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:90%
UFOs are--

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and only use common
sense-- you don't

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.240 align:middle line:84%
need to be a rocket
scientist to figure this out.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.220 align:middle line:84%
You use that whole
list and match it

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:84%
up to what the
government gives you--

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:84%
not leaked information,
not rumored something

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.310 align:middle line:84%
on the internet,
not what some guy

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:48.990 align:middle line:84%
told you in the
middle of Kansas.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:84%
This is stuff that
the CIA, the NSA--

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:84%
fill in the acronym that
they'll give it to you.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.200 align:middle line:90%
You match those up.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Nothing makes sense from
that skeptic's list.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:90%
And I've tried.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Could this be a shooting star?

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Could this be the planet Venus?

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Could this be whatever,
you know, silly--

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:06.454 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Easy to rule out.

00:39:06.454 --> 00:39:07.786 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Rule them all out.

00:39:07.786 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's easy to
rule them all out.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.890 align:middle line:90%
So what are you left with?

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.750 align:middle line:84%
The military doesn't
know what it's flying?

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, that doesn't
make sense either.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Why would
all of these documents--

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
not another country,

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.510 align:middle line:90%
because we'd be on top of that.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:19.426 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly.

00:39:19.426 --> 00:39:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So it hasn't come out that Iran,
China, or the former Soviet

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Union had aircraft in
our skies in the '70s,

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:90%
and that's what it was.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.920 align:middle line:84%
No, that's never
been proven before.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So when you try and match
all those explanations up,

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.682 align:middle line:90%
nothing works.

00:39:36.682 --> 00:39:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, even though, again,
I'm the kind of person

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.097 align:middle line:90%
that needs to see to believe--

00:39:40.097 --> 00:39:40.930 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:43.555 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: --there is a
very short list of, well,

00:39:43.555 --> 00:39:45.090 align:middle line:90%
what are we left with?

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And that
extraterrestrial presence

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:84%
is, kind of, one of the
only things that make sense

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and that is a threat
to national security.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Because then, that makes sense.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't they tell us?

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.889 align:middle line:84%
And then, you start
thinking of the reasons why,

00:39:57.889 --> 00:39:58.860 align:middle line:90%
and that makes sense.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.737 align:middle line:84%
Again, the skeptic list
doesn't make sense,

00:40:00.737 --> 00:40:02.070 align:middle line:90%
because you can rule it all out.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD:
Extraterrestrial presence?

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.718 align:middle line:84%
That's, kind of, what you're
left with, and it makes sense.

00:40:06.718 --> 00:40:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the 1960s,
we had amazing cases.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.210 align:middle line:90%
We had abduction cases--

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Barney and Betty Hill.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.170 align:middle line:90%
We have landing stories--

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Socorro, New Mexico,
with the police officer,

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.350 align:middle line:84%
the late Lonnie
Zamora who saw things.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
We have the landing
pad indentations.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.110 align:middle line:90%
We had burned-out residue.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.760 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that anymore.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.870 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Why did those stop occurring?

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: I don't
think that they've stopped.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I think-- and I'm going to
be a negative Nancy here

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.160 align:middle line:90%
for a second--

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I think the internet has
largely harmed UFO research.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And
I'm a tech geek,

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and my whole life is running
a website on the internet.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think that it's ruined it,
because I think a lot of people

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.950 align:middle line:84%
are doing nothing but
hoaxes for whatever reason.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Some want millions of hits
on their YouTube channel,

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's muddied
the waters a lot.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.144 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or
disinformationed people?

00:41:04.144 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: It's possible.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.476 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look at our
history with the government,

00:41:07.476 --> 00:41:11.864 align:middle line:84%
and there was a past program
that there was disinformation.

00:41:11.864 --> 00:41:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A great way
to screw things up.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Exactly.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.242 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some disinformation
guy online all the time.

00:41:16.242 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And
that was probably

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.020 align:middle line:90%
needed for their agenda.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't support
that, but that was

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:84%
needed for their agenda
30, 40, 50 years ago.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, this day and age, the
public does the work for them.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I think you've got
all those people from around

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.110 align:middle line:84%
the globe that are
incredibly talented--

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that's my producer
side talking--

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:37.957 align:middle line:84%
that can do CGI and animation
that look photo-realistic--

00:41:37.957 --> 00:41:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: --that
looks like moving video--

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
Hollywood movies.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah,
exactly-- where

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:45.987 align:middle line:84%
George Lucas would pay
hundreds of thousands

00:41:45.987 --> 00:41:47.070 align:middle line:90%
of dollars for this stuff.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And you find out it's some
kid in some former Soviet bloc

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.160 align:middle line:84%
country that just put
a UFO video out there

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and got 28 million hits in
a week and a half, you know?

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's money
to be made by that,

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.242 align:middle line:84%
so there is
incentive and motive.

00:41:59.242 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Because some people say,
well, why would you do that?

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, money talks.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think these
things are still continuing?

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.275 align:middle line:90%
People are being abducted--

00:42:05.275 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: I think so, yeah.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and those
cases are happening?

00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: And when
you've got a 98% hoax, error,

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.050 align:middle line:84%
or misidentification
rate, arguably,

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of these things
can be explained away,

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.550 align:middle line:84%
those 2% or whatever the
percentage is of people who--

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:90%
the Lonnie Zamoras of today--

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.520 align:middle line:84%
go out and see a craft in the
field, and see indentations--

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.661 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or pilots reports.

00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Pilot
reports-- all of that.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:32.910 align:middle line:84%
The fear of ridicule is off
the charts now, because now,

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:36.180 align:middle line:84%
the public is so saturated with
those Hollywood blockbusters--

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:90%
that's fake--

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.950 align:middle line:84%
hearing about a
sensationalized UFO report.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And I won't call any
of the tabloids out,

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.510 align:middle line:84%
but there are British
newspapers that love

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.400 align:middle line:90%
to run these types of stories.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
on the front page

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.350 align:middle line:84%
of the website that get
millions of hits, which is what,

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:54.232 align:middle line:90%
to a newspaper, they want.

00:42:54.232 --> 00:42:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It comes out a week and
a half, two weeks later

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:59.190 align:middle line:84%
at some publicity
stunt, and you never

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.350 align:middle line:84%
see any type of
story about that.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:04.112 align:middle line:84%
So they get the hits that
they want, and they move on,

00:43:04.112 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's what you
see this day and age.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.210 align:middle line:90%
PR stunts-- you see that a lot--

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.370 align:middle line:90%
hoaxes.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And the more sensational it
gets, the more press it gets.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So not to be too
negative on it, but I

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.800 align:middle line:84%
think that that largely
harms the true research--

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: --with
people like myself

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:24.250 align:middle line:84%
who are looking for the
Lonnie Zamoras of today,

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:27.850 align:middle line:84%
but it also hurts the
Lonnie Zamoras of today that

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:32.080 align:middle line:84%
are afraid to come out and say,
George, this is what I saw,

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.880 align:middle line:84%
this is the photograph,
and this is this.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And your audience
will probably handle

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.140 align:middle line:84%
it just fine and not
ridicule, but if they

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.930 align:middle line:84%
get on some television program
or if they're lucky enough

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:42.687 align:middle line:84%
to get a little bit
of press for it,

00:43:42.687 --> 00:43:44.770 align:middle line:84%

at their neighborhood.

00:43:45.686 --> 00:43:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The media
years ago, John,

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:52.417 align:middle line:84%
was a little more accepting
of these kinds of stories.

00:43:52.417 --> 00:43:54.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to be
today, and I'm talking

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.249 align:middle line:90%
about the general media.

00:43:55.249 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think it's
that the print industry has

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:00.910 align:middle line:90%
been hurt a lot over the years.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.644 align:middle line:84%
The internet has redefined
newspapers as a whole,

00:44:04.644 --> 00:44:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and I think that
they're looking, again,

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:09.760 align:middle line:84%
for those hits, because in
the internet digital realm

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:84%
of today, hits
translates into dollars.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So people aren't
spending $0.75 or $1.25

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.560 align:middle line:84%
or whatever for a
newspaper anymore.

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:84%
They're going
online, and they're

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.696 align:middle line:84%
flipping through their
phone, and that's

00:44:20.696 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:90%
how they're getting their news.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's how the newspapers
are getting their money.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will the
BlackVault.com one day

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.190 align:middle line:84%
get that one document, that
one document that says,

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:36.100 align:middle line:90%
we are being visited?

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GREENEWALD: I hope so.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.373 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's under the
assumption the government would

00:44:41.373 --> 00:44:42.370 align:middle line:90%
release it.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I think if they ever do,
it might be a mistake,

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:47.120 align:middle line:90%
and mistakes have happened.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.474 align:middle line:84%
Some I've publicized before,
which wasn't a threat

00:44:49.474 --> 00:44:50.390 align:middle line:90%

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not a mistake to do
it, but a mistake leaking it?

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:56.789 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Well, yeah, they
make mistakes when they release

00:44:56.789 --> 00:44:57.705 align:middle line:90%
information, meaning--

00:44:57.705 --> 00:44:57.970 align:middle line:90%

>>GREENEWALD: Back-track?

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So then, the question
is, well, what

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:03.640 align:middle line:90%
do I do if it was a mistake?

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, if they
sent it officially

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.770 align:middle line:84%
but it was a mistake,
do I publish it or not?

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
different show in itself.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But I just don't
think the government

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:15.670 align:middle line:84%
will release that
type of evidence

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.830 align:middle line:90%
yet, at least not anytime soon.

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But what we have to do is
look at that bigger picture.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that even though
we don't have that smoking-gun,

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.270 align:middle line:84%
aliens are real and they're
visiting document, which we all

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:32.650 align:middle line:84%
want, I think when you look at
all those pieces of the puzzle,

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.840 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize
that that quite possibly

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.250 align:middle line:90%
is what is going on.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What keeps
you going, John?

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>>GREENEWALD: It depends
on how I look at it.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I have a personal curiosity, so
that is one of my number ones.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:51.970 align:middle line:10%
The number two is the reaction
I get from the public.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And I've gotten letters
from second-, third-,

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.940 align:middle line:84%
fourth-grade students
that are just,

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of, researching
something for a small report,

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.110 align:middle line:84%
all the way up into
college thesis papers,

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:08.140 align:middle line:84%
doctorate papers on alien
life, all the way up to--

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I remember a

>>NOORY: It's because
of your creed.

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GREENEWALD: Yeah, and
that kind of public reaction

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:23.780 align:middle line:90%
is awesome to me.
