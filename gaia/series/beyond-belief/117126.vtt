00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.350 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, that
was an excerpt from the movie,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:10%
"Exorcist House of Evil."

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:10%
How would you like to go to
sleep after seeing that movie?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Kind of chilling.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
The filmmaker, of course,
who put that all together

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:84%
is Jeff Lewis from Saint Louis,
one of my neck of the woods,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.752 align:middle line:84%
That was a kind of a
scary scene, Jeffrey.

00:01:55.752 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFF LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.257 align:middle line:84%
And we were kind of worried
about Hayden, the young boy,

00:02:00.257 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of going through all
that in the actual room.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.057 align:middle line:10%
So we had prep him and
his mother on the events

00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:10%
that had taken place, and
assured him that he was OK--

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:10%
and his mother that he was OK.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: How'd you
find the little guy?

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:10%
>>LEWIS: He submitted his
resume and a head shot.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.220 align:middle line:10%
And he just had such a fantastic
look, as to somebody from 1949,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:10%
and was just a neat little
kid when he came in.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:90%
So we cast him immediately.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I hope he doesn't
have nightmares now.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.321 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: No, we talked to
him, and he's all good.

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:90%
He's fine.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He didn't
answer the phone like,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING IN GRAVELY VOICE)
what do you want, Jeff?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Nope, no.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:90%
No Redrums, no nothing.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
He's doing good and was
at the premiere last night

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.814 align:middle line:84%
at the Saint Louis Film
Festival and doing good.

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Great.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Lots of interest in evil, "The
Exorcist," stories like that.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.595 align:middle line:90%
How come it's so big these days?

00:02:49.595 --> 00:02:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I think
everybody's kind

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:90%
of looking for what's beyond.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's always had
that-- does life truly end?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that looking for
things like that and spirits

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and demons, kind
of proves the fact

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.340 align:middle line:84%
that there's life beyond what
we know in the physical form.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Let's go back and
talk about the actual story

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that the book "The
Exorcist" was written about,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
by William Blatty, and,
of course, the movie

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:90%
"The Exorcist" with Linda Blair.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Linda Blair, right.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It was a
real story, wasn't it?

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Right, yes.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:90%
The actual events took place.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:90%
They did take some licensing.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Linda Blair played
the girl, in the film.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.837 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Spins--
I'll always remember

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:90%
her head spinning around.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: The spinning
head and the pea soup--

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:90%
that's the two things.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But the real case
was a young boy.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:84%
It did start in Maryland,
where he and his family

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:90%
saw carvings in his stomach.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And this all took place after
an aunt, and elderly aunt,

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
had given him a Ouija
board for Christmas.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.854 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Uh-huh.

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: She passed away
several months later,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's when she started
speaking to him from beyond.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Once they got the carving
in the stomach that said,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:84%
"Louis," that drove the family
to come to St. Louis to seek

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.494 align:middle line:90%
help from the Jesuit priests.

00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what brought them
to St. Louis and to the house

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.904 align:middle line:90%
in Bel-Nor.

00:04:06.904 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you think that
they originally thought either

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
the kid was
self-mutilating himself,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:84%
or that somebody else would
have carved that on him?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.667 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: No, I think back
in 1949, none of that

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
was back then.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I think today, people would look
as if it's a self-mutilation

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:90%
or schizophrenia.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
But back in 1949, that really
wasn't-- that wasn't an issue

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and a social issue that I
think people even dealt with.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a common thing
today that we look at.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.822 align:middle line:84%
But back in 1949, it was
more of a spiritual thing.

00:04:37.822 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
The thing that they
did find interesting,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.860 align:middle line:84%
that the carvings weren't
from an exterior carving,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
they were in an
interior carving--

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:90%
coming from the inside.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.481 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: The inside out, yeah.

00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: So that also takes
it from being the kid doing it

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:90%
to himself.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.176 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There were a
couple priests involved

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:54.002 align:middle line:90%
in the exorcist--

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Correct.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: --and the exorcism.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:90%
One was in St. Louis.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:90%
He died.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I tried to interview
him years ago.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Father Bowdern?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:90%
It was a real story.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And it really scared
a lot of people.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
They tried to exercise
him in the house,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:90%
and they did work on that.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But they also moved him to
the old Alexian Brothers

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.895 align:middle line:90%
Hospital in Saint Louis--

00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Right.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: --put him in a
room, and what happened there?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, they did-- they
worked on him in the house.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Things-- once he got
to the house, started

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:84%
to intensify to the
point-- and this

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.354 align:middle line:90%
was his aunt and uncle's house.

00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So the family--
once things really

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
started to intensify-- because
it just wasn't the two priests.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:90%
It was seven, eight priests.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.935 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They were all--

00:05:40.935 --> 00:05:43.185 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: They were there all
day long, 24 hours a day,

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:90%
in shifts and doing this.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So once it finally
became so traumatic

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the
family members,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.174 align:middle line:84%
they figured they
had to move him.

00:05:50.174 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
They put him in a private
wing of the hospital

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
to where they could
monitor him 24 hours a day

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and have constantly
bombarded by the priests.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And they finally exorcised
the demon, so they thought,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.892 align:middle line:90%
out of him.

00:06:04.892 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And then
the hospital comes in.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, and then the
hospital shut that wing down.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: It hadn't been
opened from the '50s

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:84%
until, I believe it was '85
or so, when they tore it down.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And then I think
they've torn the building down.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.173 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:06:19.173 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
story about that

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.542 align:middle line:84%
was, when they went to
knock down the hospital,

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
they just went in with
the regular cranes

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:90%
and knocked the hospital down.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.929 align:middle line:84%
That section of hospital
they could not knock down.

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So they had to go
to extreme measures

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
to get that particular
section to be knocked down.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But before they did all that,
they got rid of the furniture.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they found
Father Bowdern's diary

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
that he was keeping
through the entire process.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was locked
in a desk drawer,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and that's where they found
the diary-- of which we found

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and used that as a
template for what

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:84%
was going on in the house and
the real things that happened.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So there was no
spinning head, but there

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
was levitations
and extreme power

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.880 align:middle line:84%
by this boy and multiple
voices and different voices

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:90%
that he wouldn't know.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did the priest,
in his notes, seem scared?

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I think his
faith was tested.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And he-- in the readings,
it doesn't come off

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that he's scared,
but he's definitely

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
worried about the other family
members, as well as the boy.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Because these are things
that he had not experienced.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.365 align:middle line:84%
When you start getting
beds levitating and--

00:07:33.365 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.865 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: There are
stories where the kid just

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:38.090 align:middle line:84%
used several
fingers to throw off

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:90%
grown men against the walls.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, then it
starts getting to--

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Truly amazing.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.056 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --something
more powerful

00:07:45.056 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:90%
than just a normal boy.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The little
boy is now an adult.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I think his name is Roland Doe.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, that's the
name that the chruch--

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Or is that the John
Doe that they've given him?

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, that's the name
that the church has given him.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And they've gone to
great pains to keep

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.179 align:middle line:84%
that name disclosed,
because they

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:01.470 align:middle line:90%
didn't want him to be bothered.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And he's never
gone public, has he?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: He's never gone public.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.721 align:middle line:84%
The only things that we were
able to find out about him

00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:08.754 align:middle line:84%
is that he became a
lawyer in Washington,

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:90%
and a very prominent lawyer.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.629 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: DC?

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:90%
And his life has been fine.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.604 align:middle line:84%
There's been no
relapses or recurrences.

00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So he's doing, to the best
of everyone's knowledge--

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He's going to
become the Antichrist.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.783 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who knows?

00:08:22.783 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: He's doing well.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who knows?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.985 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Stranger
things have happened.

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:29.631 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He obviously knows
that he was the little boy who

00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:30.755 align:middle line:90%
went through this exorcism.

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.338 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: He does know that
he was the little boy that

00:08:33.338 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:90%
went through it.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:84%
And we've-- through research,
we have learned that he

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really remember
a whole lot about things.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:90%
He remembers bits and pieces.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.218 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: It's almost
like, kind of,

00:08:43.218 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:84%
being in a coma, to
where he remembers--

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:84%
he fades in and out of
the events that took place

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:90%
over those months.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So during the days, when
things would be quiet,

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:84%
he remembers more
times like that.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
When things would start to pick
up with the possession, that's

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
kind of when, you know,
his mind would black out,

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.134 align:middle line:84%
and he just kind of has
loss of time and memory

00:09:04.134 --> 00:09:04.800 align:middle line:90%
of those events.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Let's take
another clip from the film.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
a clip from "Exorcist House
of Evil," Jeff Lewis' film.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And, Jeff, just
to set the stage,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.972 align:middle line:84%
that was a scene from later
on in that house, right?

00:10:44.972 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Correct.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:90%
That's a present-day scene.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.960 align:middle line:84%
We start the movie off just
kind of giving the audience

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
a taste of what was
going on in 1949,

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and then we progress
to the present day

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:90%
when Amy takes over the house.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What's become
of the house to date?

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, today,
somebody does live in it.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And he enjoys the fact that it
was the real Exorcist house.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.279 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't want to have--

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Does he have parties?

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: He does have parties.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.338 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't want
to know it's haunted.

00:11:15.338 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:84%
We would try to explain to him--
because we would shoot all day,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and he would leave
the house for us.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:90%
And we had such a small crew.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And we would try to tell him
things that would happen to us,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.689 align:middle line:84%
or things we would hear,
and experiences we had.

00:11:25.689 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I really
don't want to know.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.605 align:middle line:84%
He's like, if I really
think this place is haunted,

00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have to move.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.192 align:middle line:84%
So, he likes the fact that
it's the Exorcist house,

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
but just doesn't want to
know it's haunted, so.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I know this past
Halloween, "Destination

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:84%
America" aired a live
exorcism from that very house.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Right.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And, of course,
it was television,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and it was-- some things
were forced, I think.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Nothing really happened.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:84%
They tried to give you the
impression that something did,

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
but it's very difficult to
capture things on live TV.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.230 align:middle line:84%
But I did get the
feeling, Jeffrey,

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.860 align:middle line:84%
that there's still something
weird about that house.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: There is.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is
something left over.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I think, when you have
traumatic experiences in places,

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:84%
events are captured
in time and a place.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.784 align:middle line:84%
And we ran into
several instances

00:12:12.784 --> 00:12:14.450 align:middle line:84%
while we were shooting
and actually left

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:90%
those in the film.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:84%
We caught different
voices on our audio.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Some voices that we couldn't
hear until later on--

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Later on when
you listen to it, yeah.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: --that we went.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And we actually, one night,
we were all sitting there

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:84%
in the bedroom where it
actually took place and heard

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:90%
a blood-curdling scream.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.067 align:middle line:90%
The entire crew heard it.

00:12:31.067 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:90%
The actors heard it.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:90%
We all kind of stopped.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could figure
out where this came from.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:90%
We would see doors close.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.210 align:middle line:90%
We saw--

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Creepy.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.146 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --a little
image of a boy

00:12:40.146 --> 00:12:43.020 align:middle line:84%
up in a window, when
nobody was in the house.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided-- I told
the director, I said,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.197 align:middle line:84%
these are things I want
to be left in the film.

00:12:47.197 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing
to do with the film.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: They don't
work in the scene.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:90%

>>LEWIS: Just let them go.

00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Just like whatever happens,
happen, and leave it be.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you said,
during the original situation

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:84%
for the little boy,
it happened because he

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:90%
was given a Ouija board.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%

00:13:56.744 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Jeff, I've got to tell
you, I'm no fan of Ouija boards

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I had a bad experience back in
one of my studios in St. Louis

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.370 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Never again.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:84%
You brought a Ouija board here
for us to kind of look at.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's how it all started
in the original Exorcist case,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.208 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Correct.

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the boy was given,
by his aunt, a Ouija board

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:90%
for Christmas, of all things.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Merry Christmas.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.334 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the demon world.

00:14:23.334 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And she passed away
about six months later,

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and once she passed
away is when they

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.520 align:middle line:84%
started getting contact who
they believed was from her.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And her form of communication
was the scarification

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
on the boy, which drove
them to come to St. Louis

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure
out how to end that.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did they ever find out
who the demon might have been?

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Not to my knowledge.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
When they were
talking to the boy,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:84%
there were instances
where he would

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.094 align:middle line:84%
be speaking in different
voices at the same time.

00:14:57.094 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Different tongues.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.634 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: There
was one case where

00:14:59.634 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:84%
he was having three
different conversations,

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:84%
at the same time,
coming out of his mouth.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So they know there was
more than one demon in him.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.686 align:middle line:84%
They said there could have
been as many as three to five.

00:15:10.686 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was just an interesting--
that nobody's ever really

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.200 align:middle line:84%
been able to peg it down
to one particular demon

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.116 align:middle line:84%
or get a name, which
they do try to do.

00:15:20.116 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Exorcists try to
get a name from you.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:90%
They want that name.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, and that was
the thing we were always

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:84%
trying to search for, was
there ever a name to be given.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:90%
And there was never one.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do you
think of possession?

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.489 align:middle line:90%
What do you think is it?

00:15:32.489 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Uh.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.724 align:middle line:10%
If you were to ask
me before this film,

00:15:36.724 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:10%
I would have said it's-- you're
dealing more with a mental

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:10%
issue, you're schizophrenia.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:84%
But after going through this
and doing all the research,

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe there is
something to that.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there
is a dark side

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and there are demons out
there, as well as angels.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:84%
The one story that I
always listen to and took

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:84%
great interest in, was when
the boy was at the Alexian

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Hospital, the night that they
exorcised the demons from him,

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.845 align:middle line:84%
supposedly the Jesuit
priests in the church

00:16:08.845 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:84%
were around the
church that night.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And there was, I
think, four of them.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And they saw the Archangel
Michael walking down

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:90%
the center aisle.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Whoa.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And they said
it just so happened

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to correspond with when
the exorcism supposedly

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:90%
finished in the hospital.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So now, whether
Michael the Archangel

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:90%
had anything to do with it--

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sheesh.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --but the
coincidence that these priests

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
did notate that they did see
Michael the Archangel, who they

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.566 align:middle line:84%
believed, walking
down the center aisle

00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and disappear once
he got to the altar.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's a battle
between good and bad, isn't it?

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.641 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:16:42.641 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Constantly.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.139 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yes, I do
believe that now.

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I never believed, in
the past, of ghosts.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I was more of the kid that was
always into aliens and things

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:90%
But ghosts, no.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But working in that
house has definitely

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.087 align:middle line:90%
changed my perception on that.

00:16:55.087 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All right.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look at a
possession clip from the movie,

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:90%
"Exorcist House of Evil."

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.789 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.872 align:middle line:84%
>>FATHER HALLORAN: You've
never seen these before?

00:17:05.872 --> 00:17:08.824 align:middle line:90%
>>AMY: No.

00:17:08.824 --> 00:17:13.252 align:middle line:84%
She's always had
her arms covered.

00:17:13.252 --> 00:17:22.108 align:middle line:90%
T-E-S. Aunt Margaret?

00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:24.823 align:middle line:90%
>>AUNT MARGARET: Who are you?

00:17:24.823 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:90%
>>AMY: I'm Amy.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I know you don't remember me,
but I need you to remember.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
How did you get these
scratches on your arm?

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Who did this to you?

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.515 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.515 --> 00:17:42.265 align:middle line:84%
>>AUNT MARGARET: I
don't know who you are.

00:17:42.265 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING IN DEMONIC
VOICE) I remember you.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, that
was pleasant, Jeff.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.145 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING IN GRAVELY
VOICE) "I remember you."

00:17:53.145 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.646 align:middle line:90%
Last thing you want to hear.

00:17:54.646 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So that was the demon
from the original "Exorcist"

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.925 align:middle line:84%
in that woman, who
remembered that priest.

00:18:00.925 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Right.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.425 align:middle line:90%
Right, from the past.

00:18:02.425 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Because, in the beginning
scene, the little boy

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
makes the same statement
that he remembers him.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And so Father Halloran is
haunted and pretty much chased

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.165 align:middle line:90%
by this demon.

00:18:13.165 --> 00:18:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We're going to show
one last clip, in a moment,

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
on that movie, but I don't want
to give it away at the ending.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like what you do
as a director and producer is,

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:84%
you took the original
story of "The Exorcism,"

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:84%
moved it into the house where
things occurred, and brought it

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.825 align:middle line:90%
into current times.

00:18:34.825 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Right.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Myself and the
director, David Trotti,

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.210 align:middle line:84%
we sat down and
tried to-- we didn't

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:44.230 align:middle line:84%
want to do just a story
of the 1949 exorcism.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.526 align:middle line:84%
We wanted just to kind of
do a brief story of that

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to bring the
audience up to speed

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.047 align:middle line:90%
of what this house represents.

00:18:50.047 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we brought
it in modern time,

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.890 align:middle line:84%
so we could kind of see
where has this house gone--

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:90%
in the journey of this house.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Because, to us, the house was
another actor in the story

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:90%
and what's happened to it.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And, for the longest
time, the house

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.524 align:middle line:84%
had sat vacant before the
current owner had bought it.

00:19:06.524 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody wanted
anything to do with the house.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why don't
they just level it?

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.499 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, you
know, I don't know.

00:19:12.499 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There's
obviously something

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.248 align:middle line:90%
still going on in that house.

00:19:15.248 --> 00:19:17.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: There's
something still going on.

00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:84%
During the filming,
we would talk

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.973 align:middle line:84%
to the neighbors on
both sides, and actually

00:19:20.973 --> 00:19:22.650 align:middle line:84%
in the whole street,
and everybody

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:90%
has stories of that house.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.789 align:middle line:84%
They know when the owner is
gone, and they'll hear things.

00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And they'll see
things in the window.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.038 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Creepy.

00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.445 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You think they'd
like that house leveled?

00:19:33.445 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: No, I don't.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.694 align:middle line:84%
I think they
actually enjoy the--

00:19:35.694 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They
like the notoriety.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.053 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --being in
that neighborhood, yeah.

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it really,
kind of, has become

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:90%
the staple of the neighborhood.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I know that area.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:90%
It's near the airport.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Right.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And that airport
area-- Bridgeton for example--

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
is under fire right now
because of a burning landfill

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.065 align:middle line:84%
that's getting close
to a nuclear dump.

00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Right.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.049 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And so that's
got its own evils--

00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yep.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.715 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: --in its own way.

00:20:01.715 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:84%
We've got a final
clip from the movie.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKE: It's just a
ghost scratching letters

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.422 align:middle line:84%
into your skin because of
a spirit talking thing.

00:20:11.422 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AMY: It's a spirit
talking board.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKE: Whatever, Amy.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:14.827 align:middle line:90%
It sounds crazy.

00:20:14.827 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AMY: You think I don't
know how it sounds?

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.077 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.077 --> 00:20:27.004 align:middle line:84%
I think something-- someone is
trying to tell me something.

00:20:27.004 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKE: What?

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AMY: I don't know.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:90%
But I have to find out.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.361 align:middle line:84%
As crazy as that sounds,
I need to know what it is.

00:20:34.361 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKE: And what if you don't
like what the answer is?

00:20:36.610 --> 00:21:04.292 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.292 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Look, you know
what it's like to win Emmys.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.107 align:middle line:84%
That one might
qualify for one, huh?

00:21:09.107 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.220 align:middle line:84%
With Star Trek, I was nominated
six times for Star Trek,

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:90%
and you know, so.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, we're
happy with the film.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking
forward to doing more.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.565 align:middle line:84%
And people keep
asking if we're going

00:21:21.565 --> 00:21:22.814 align:middle line:90%
to go back and do another one.

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, we're trying to
consider if we should go back

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:90%
and tempt fate again.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You got me on the set
of one of the Star Trek films

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.087 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:21:31.087 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: I did that.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And brought in Jolene
Blalock to the show,

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
when you first moved out
to LA and started the show.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.346 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:36.346 --> 00:21:36.702 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:21:36.702 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Yep, you sure did.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Scott Bakula, I think,
was on during that time.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Scott Bakula
who is from St. Louis.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.525 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of great
talent from St. Louis, Jeff.

00:21:43.525 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Oh, there is.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.104 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
started the production

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
company in Saint Louis and
want to film more back there.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we have so many
great things to see and do,

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and it just gives a
new look to films.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.557 align:middle line:84%
Because we've all seen
LA before, in every film.

00:21:56.557 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You've always
kept your St. Louis roots.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: I have.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.018 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
important to me, now,

00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:84%
to start something there and
use local talent, to show off.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm proud
of where I'm from.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:90%
And I think we can do good work.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.362 align:middle line:84%
I still have my LA
friends, and they all

00:22:12.362 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:84%
want to come to
St. Louis and work.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:84%
In this film, I brought Connor
Trinneer, from Star Trek fame,

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.709 align:middle line:90%
to be in the film.

00:22:19.709 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I have more
friends that want to come,

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.660 align:middle line:90%
because they enjoy being here.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, I get a kick--
being a broadcaster-- of being

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
from an area-- though
I was born in Detroit,

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:90%
I moved to St. Louis in '79.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm in an area
where Joe Garagiola came

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:84%
from, Jack Buck came
from, Joe Buck, his son,

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Bobby Costas, who's
a friend of mine.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And to be a part of that
family is just a great feeling.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of great people.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.646 align:middle line:84%
We've got John Goodman, and
Laurie Metcalf, and Jon Hamm.

00:22:48.646 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.311 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And there are
so many good people.

00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:52.620 align:middle line:90%
And they all love St. Louis.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
They still reside there
and love to come back.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And so my mission is to keep
the production company going

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.072 align:middle line:84%
and bring more work
back to St. Louis--

00:23:03.072 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Good for you.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --and
just have some fun.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Good for you.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And Vincent Price
used to be there.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Vincent Price, yep.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:84%
He's a local St. Louis,
and always, always

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:90%
happy to hear "Thriller."

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Jeff, do you
think it's one entity,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:84%
or do you think there's a
series of demons hanging around?

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.616 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I've gotta believe--
after listening, and reading

00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
the notes, and what
would happen to the boy--

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I've got to believe
that it's multiple.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's just one.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.491 align:middle line:84%
The voices we caught were two
different voices on audio.

00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:32.919 align:middle line:84%
Just the things we saw--
the little boy we saw.

00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think there might be a
little something with that.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.015 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They just
bombarded him, didn't they?

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.769 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's definitely
more than one entity

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:90%
to that house.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.284 align:middle line:90%
But we did nothing to evoke it.

00:23:45.284 --> 00:23:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that our actress would
not step foot into the house

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:84%
until her priest gave
her permission to do it.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Amy?

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Amy.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.719 align:middle line:84%
And she brought crucifixes
for everybody, and you know.

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow, she was serious.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:90%
She was serious.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.454 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
nobody would ever--

00:23:59.454 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:84%
during the day, everybody would
go in and out of the house

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:90%
and be pretty much OK with it.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.799 align:middle line:84%
Once night falls,
nobody ever wanted

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:90%
to go back in that house.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.464 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wanted to that
last guy to go in

00:24:08.464 --> 00:24:11.037 align:middle line:84%
and make sure all the lights
turned off and lock up.

00:24:11.037 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Well, I gotta tell you.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:90%
You have a Ouija board here.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a little uncomfortable
with this thing being here.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't like these things.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.945 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, this
was the one that we

00:24:19.945 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:90%
made for the made for the film.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.932 align:middle line:84%
And so they used this
throughout the filming of it.

00:24:25.932 --> 00:24:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I'm not even
going to touch it.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And this box here.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: That was an
antique exorcist kit

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:84%
that we found, that
the director found.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to use this
in the exorcism scenes.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to set this
up and bring some authenticity

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:84%
to the movie and to the
rituals that were being done.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, what would
have been in here?

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: In there,
you would pour in oils

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:90%
or burn some incense in there.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
You've got little
decanters where

00:24:59.020 --> 00:24:59.460 align:middle line:90%
you would keep holy water.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.334 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Holy water.

00:25:00.334 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: You definitely
have your crucifix.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.680 align:middle line:84%
You have candle
holders for candles.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Just a lot of different little
boxes and trinkets and--

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.332 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.332 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It looks authentic.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.366 align:middle line:84%
No, it's definitely
an antique kit.

00:25:20.366 --> 00:25:23.167 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you think this
was really used in exorcisms?

00:25:23.167 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.480 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, my god.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:26.911 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: You know,
back then, I think

00:25:26.911 --> 00:25:30.520 align:middle line:84%
a lot different priests
kind of kept those around.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.089 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
harder to find these days.

00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, we were able to
scrounge one up for the movie.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Jeff, any
concern that what

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.348 align:middle line:84%
might have been in
the house-- what

00:25:39.348 --> 00:25:43.650 align:middle line:84%
may still be in the house-- may
have attached itself to you?

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: No.

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I never had any
concern with that.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I know some of the
actors were concerned.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Connor Trinneer, for
example, his wife

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
would not let him come
back to their house

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.627 align:middle line:90%
until she smudged him--

00:25:54.627 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He was cleansed.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes, exactly.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:90%
So people do take that serious.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But, as far as I was
concerned, I knew I was safe.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I've never
had any worries.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And nothing bad has happened
since we did the film.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Heard no creepy sounds
around my own house,

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I actually had my
son on the set,

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
helping me out during
his summer vacation.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It was, for most of us,
it was a great experience.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.647 align:middle line:84%
And some were a little
scared, but nothing's

00:26:26.647 --> 00:26:27.480 align:middle line:90%
happened to anybody.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's happy and healthy,
and they're all doing good.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What can you conclude
about what this all is?

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:90%
What's out there?

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I just believe
that the house, it had--

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I think it was fine before,
but once the boy went,

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:90%
I think with the--

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He
brought it with him.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: He brought it with him.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And with the exorcism,
I think the demons

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.894 align:middle line:84%
that they did exorcise out
of him stayed at the house.

00:26:49.894 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Even though they didn't
get the final ones out

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:84%
till he got to the
hospital, I think the ones

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that they did get out in the
house, stayed with the house.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So and that's what also leads
me to believe that there

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:90%
were more than just a few.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That could be.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Because
I think the ones--

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:84%
they did get some out at
the house, but they stayed.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:84%
They didn't transfer
over to the hospital.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the ones that stayed
with the hospital, I think

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:84%
is what made it hard
to tear it down.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I can assume the
scariest room in the house

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.069 align:middle line:90%
was that bedroom.

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: The bedroom was
the second-scariest room

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:90%
in the house.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, really?

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: You know, knowing that
the exorcism had taken place,

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
definitely when we all got
into the house, we thought,

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:90%
oh, my god, this is it.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.910 align:middle line:90%
We were wrong.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
When we went to the
basement, that's

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:90%
where the scariness happened.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:84%
We actually found a
wall in the basement

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that the current owner
of the house uncovered,

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
after he pulled some old
paneling off the wall.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
drawing, done by child,

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:84%
which we show in the movie,
of a character named Harold.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was a stick figure
drawing, drawn probably back

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:49.295 align:middle line:90%
in the '50s.

00:27:49.295 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Maybe by the boy?

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.503 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Maybe by the boy.

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And it had a devil on
one shoulder and an angel

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:90%
on another.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:28:08.137 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.137 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: So once
we all saw that.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:90%
We all concluded--

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.933 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:28:10.933 --> 00:28:13.512 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --the basement was
the scariest room of the house.

00:28:13.512 --> 00:28:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sheesh.

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I mean, the whole
house itself is creepy.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.400 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, the basement
really took a turn for us,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't
expecting that.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.452 align:middle line:84%
So when you're surprised by
a drawing like that, yeah.

00:28:25.452 --> 00:28:26.160 align:middle line:90%
That definitely--

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's kind of weird.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --put a new thing
into what we were doing.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The current ownership
of the house-- I mean,

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:84%
has that person felt
anything bizarre or strange?

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: He's told
us stories, but he

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.490 align:middle line:84%
has excuses of why this may have
happened, or that's happened.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:84%
He's never chalked it
up to it being haunted,

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did you have
to rent the house?

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.831 align:middle line:90%
We rented the house from him.

00:28:48.831 --> 00:28:51.080 align:middle line:84%
We would tell him what days
we were going to be there.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Because we had definitely
other locations to shoot at.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And, on the days we would shoot,
he would pack his stuff up,

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:84%
and he'd leave the house
and just gave us free reign

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:90%
to go wherever we wanted.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: So, with you,
the "Destination America"

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.000 align:middle line:84%
live exorcism from
the house-- the guy's

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:90%
making some money on the house.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He's making
a little money, yeah.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:84%
It's nice for him
that he's doing that.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.964 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, he enjoys the fact
that was the Exorcist house,

00:29:15.964 --> 00:29:17.130 align:middle line:90%
or it is the Exorcist house.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I bet he
would love to turn it

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.730 align:middle line:90%
into a tourism attraction.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Now, I don't think
his neighbors would love that.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:22.761 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No.

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: But he does
tell me at Halloween--

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's on a one-way
street into a cul-de-sac--

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes very
crowded around Halloween.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Lots of drive-bys, lots of
people getting out of cars,

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.900 align:middle line:84%
taking pictures in front
of the house on the lawn.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I wonder
what would prevent him

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:43.420 align:middle line:84%
from doing that and turning
it into a national tourist

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:90%
attraction.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I've often
wondered that.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.021 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: At 10 bucks
apiece, or something.

00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And I've talked
to him about that.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
many ways that he

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.230 align:middle line:84%
might be able to make
money off the house.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know I actually went
home with a huge bucket of dirt

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.537 align:middle line:90%
and a brick from the house.

00:29:57.537 --> 00:29:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, great.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.203 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: So I got a
piece of the house, now.

00:30:00.203 --> 00:30:01.537 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I shook your hand.

00:30:01.537 --> 00:30:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll send you some
dirt and a brick.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No, no.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It's bad enough you have this
Ouija board on our desk here.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.773 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, I'll
take this with me.

00:30:09.773 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I won't--

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What drives you, Jeff?

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.295 align:middle line:90%
Especially into this topic.

00:30:14.295 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Like I
said, I've always

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:90%
been interested in aliens.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to
explore the other side

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and see really what's out there.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always been
interested in all the stories.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.593 align:middle line:84%
And in St. Louis we've
got such great places

00:30:26.593 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:90%
like the Lemp Mansion.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:90%
We have the McPike Mansion.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And you hear of all--
you know, Illinois

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:90%
is a pretty haunted state.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got Decatur
and a lot of things.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to
kind of delve in to see,

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:90%
are these things really real?

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to look at
these things and figure out,

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.350 align:middle line:90%
are these real?

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Are these just stories?

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What do you think?

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.557 align:middle line:90%
Are they real?

00:30:47.557 --> 00:30:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Or are they stories?

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: With this house,
like feel it's real.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.715 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: I feel it's real.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.709 align:middle line:84%
I've been to other
locations where

00:30:53.709 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
people say they're
extremely haunted,

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and I've never felt a
thing, seen anything.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard for me
to make a judgment

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:90%
based on those stories.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But to go in the Exorcist
house, and hear the voices,

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and hear just sounds
we could never

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.230 align:middle line:84%
explain at night,
and things like that,

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.309 align:middle line:84%
made me a believer
that there are things.

00:31:11.309 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: When you look at
the house from the outside--

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Mm-hm.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.082 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: --does it seem to look
back at you, like it's alive?

00:31:19.082 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: It does.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got the
two corner windows.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.820 align:middle line:84%
You've got this
little round window

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.778 align:middle line:84%
in the middle that's
almost like a little nose.

00:31:24.778 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And at night, we would
have-- if you just

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.970 align:middle line:84%
had an off light in the
hallway, it would kind of shine

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:90%
through the windows and stuff.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And it would just get this
creepy little look, you know.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.911 align:middle line:90%
Now whether that's--

00:31:37.911 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Like it's laughing
at you, or just looking at you?

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I think, just
looking and studying

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.415 align:middle line:90%
who's coming to the house.

00:31:43.415 --> 00:31:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And I think, everybody
also projects their own fears

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.250 align:middle line:90%
upon that house.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think the more
scared you are, I think,

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.650 align:middle line:84%
projects itself of what
you see in that house.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, I always
wondered about demons.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't kill them.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:84%
You merely move them from
one section to another,

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:84%
from one individual
to who knows what.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So, when it leaves the
body, the possessed

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.621 align:middle line:90%
body, where does it go?

00:32:11.621 --> 00:32:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, and in this
case, I think it went and--

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:14.615 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Stayed with the house

00:32:14.615 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --stayed
with the house, yeah.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:84%
It has to have, I think,
some form of containment--

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a body,
whether it's a building.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.577 align:middle line:84%
You know, it just
needs that energy.

00:32:24.577 --> 00:32:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That attachment.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And I think that
the ones that they got out

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:84%
of the boy during that
time, I think it found

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:90%
its attachment to that home.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.094 align:middle line:90%
And it's happy being there.

00:32:33.094 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have any
of your crew members,

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:84%
or actors and actresses, had
any fallout from this film,

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.910 align:middle line:84%
in terms of something
grabbed onto them afterward?

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: No.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:90%
They're all doing really good.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:45.955 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Everybody's good.

00:32:45.955 --> 00:32:47.907 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Everybody's
happy, and--

00:32:47.907 --> 00:32:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You haven't seen
any personality changes

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:51.010 align:middle line:90%
in people, or anything?

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: No, no.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.814 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's good, and
they're all looking forward

00:32:53.814 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:90%
to doing the next one.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So they're all willing
to travel with me

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and see what other creepy
place I take them into.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You like
the unusual spots now.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to go the Mansfield
institutions and places

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:06.920 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:07.798 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I've always been a huge fan of
the show and listening to you.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's kind of really
got me into this and the movies

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:16.750 align:middle line:90%
that I want to produce.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.899 align:middle line:84%
Because I really want
to kind of find out.

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I listen to the
stories on your show,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.722 align:middle line:84%
and I really want to see--
are these just stories,

00:33:22.722 --> 00:33:24.805 align:middle line:84%
or is there something
really behind these stories?

00:33:24.805 --> 00:33:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.620 align:middle line:84%
No, we've known each other
for 12, 13 years, Jeff.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:10%
But, yeah, so that's my pursuit
and my interest and passion.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.230 align:middle line:10%
And so, hopefully we'll
keep making films.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:10%
We'll make an interesting
film in an interesting place

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.446 align:middle line:10%
and kind of blend
the two together.

00:33:40.446 --> 00:33:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, if
people want to watch

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.430 align:middle line:84%
"Exorcist House of Evil,"
how do they do that?

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, right now, it's
going to be video-on-demand,

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to work out
deals with any of the cable

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:51.360 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: OK.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Sounds exciting.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Good luck
with your work.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, thanks for
having us, and we appreciate it.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Spooky stuff.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.490 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: I shook
his hand, but I'm

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:10%
going to wash it, right
after this program.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:90%
