>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome to
this edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.410 align:middle line:10%
Julia Gordon-Bramer is with
us, a professional tarot card

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:10%
reader, scholar of the
mysticism of Sylvia Plath.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
Sylvia in a moment.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:84%
She is also an award winning
poet, former professor

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:84%
of creative writing in the
graduate program at Lindenwood

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:84%
University, which is a great
school because that's not

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:84%
too far from where I live
in the Saint Louis area.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIA GORDON-BRAMER:
That's right.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about Sylvia Plath.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:10%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Sylvia
Plath-- well, she's

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:10%
the subject of my next book.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:10%
My current book is
"Tarot Life Lessons."

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:10%
And I like to say that Sylvia
made me a better tarot card

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:10%
reader because I've
been studying her

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:10%
for over 20 years and the
mysticism behind her work.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:10%
Most people don't realize this.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:10%
Most people just know her
as suicidal, depressive.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:10%
They may have read
"The Bell Jar."

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:10%
And Sylvia goes a
lot deeper than that.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was
suicidal and depressive?

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.583 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh, yes, yes,
she killed herself at age 30.

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She killed herself?

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what she's,
unfortunately, best known for.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, I think it was
Gwyneth Paltrow starred

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:90%
in a movie called "Sylvia."

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And in just about her drama,
she was quite beautiful.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
She was married to a very
handsome, philandering guy.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's all people know.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah, so
it's kind of a sad story.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to think that
my purpose is to raise her out

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:84%
When I was in graduate
school in 2007,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a
semester end project.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't find an idea.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And I had seen a lot of tarot
imagery in Plath's work.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned it
to my professor.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know what
I was talking about.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over his head.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Over his head.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
realized you had

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
to be both a tarot scholar
and a Plath scholar

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:90%
to kind of match it up.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But Sylvia Plath wrote
her book "Ariel,"

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty much her
greatest work of poetry,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:84%
in perfect alignment
with the tarot.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you know how
to read it, if you

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
match the cards corresponding
the numbers to the poems,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
the poems take on radically
different translations.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty interesting.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knows this.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And scholars are actually
not happy about it.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:84%
People have invested
their careers

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.355 align:middle line:84%
in that depressive
suicidal Sylvia.

00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Julia, how
far back do tarot cards go?

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: [SHARP EXHALE]
We know for a fact

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.900 align:middle line:84%
that decks are as
old as the 1400s.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long?

00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: That long.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.830 align:middle line:90%
They may be older.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But the 1400s is
what we've dated--

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
what they have found.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:90%
There's a lore behind the tarot.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And I do like to say lore
because the historical sticklers

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:90%
will get on me about this.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.260 align:middle line:90%
It isn't proven.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
But the Romani people
took the tarot,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
which embodies secrets,
symbolism, numerology,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of mysticism.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's rooted in
the Kabbalah, which

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:90%
is ancient Jewish mysticism.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was a way to hide
it during the Crusades

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and to bring it
all through Europe.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Were they first created
like as a parlor game?

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Well,
people like to-- some people

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle line:84%
do play tarot as a
parlor game, even today.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It can be known as
Tarock or Tarocchi.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Most people tend
to think that it's

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:90%
used for divination primarily.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And the parlor
game was the excuse

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
for having the cards in
case the Church asked back

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:90%
in the 1400s or so.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.954 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's 78
individual cards in a deck.

00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:19.829 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yes.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they used for?

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
So those 78 cards

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
have two different meanings,
depending on whether they're

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.762 align:middle line:90%
right side up or upside down.

00:04:28.762 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you have a deck.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Let me hold it up.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.697 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: I do.

00:04:31.697 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are two kinds of
groups within these 78 cards.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So we have the Major
Arcana, which are

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:90%
kind of the more famous cards.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
you've seen before.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
You've probably seen the
Hermit card or the Lovers card

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:84%
or the Death card--
famous in Hollywood.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't want that one.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh, that's
actually not a bad card.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what I hear
from tarot cards readers.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.635 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: It's
very misunderstood.

00:04:53.635 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it
does freak me out.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But the Major Arcana is
those big life events.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And the Minor Arcana is the
more everyday, mundane things.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
The Death card should
not freak you out.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It says that the old
life is behind you.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:90%
And everything has changed.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So you may get the Death
card if you graduate,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:84%
if you get married, if
you have a child, if you

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:90%
retire, if you get divorced.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It can mean death
because that can also

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:84%
change your life in a big way
if somebody else dies perhaps.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
But it almost never
means that you're dying.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in tarot card reading?

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:10%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Well, this is
the first chapter of my book

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:10%
"Tarot Life Lessons" because
it's probably the question I get

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:10%
asked the most.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:10%
I was 16.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was wandering around
a mall on a hot summer day.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:90%
And I walked into a magic shop.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And I like to say that--

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How cool?

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: We don't have--

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
back in the 70s, when
I was growing up,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
there were not these new-age
shops that we have today,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
with the crystals
and the pendulums--

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't have that.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.718 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
--and all of that.

00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:90%
This was actual magic--

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:84%
so pulling rabbits out of hats
and sponge balls and the gag

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.830 align:middle line:90%
gifts and that sort of thing.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And in this
particular shop, there

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
was a glass case and a young
woman of probably about 20 years

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:84%
old who, to my
16-year-old self, seemed

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:90%
so knowledgeable and cool.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:84%
She said to me, do you want
to see some real magic?

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:90%
And she--

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.372 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little girl.

00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Right.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And she beckoned me over.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And the rest is history.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I plunked down my
babysitting money.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And I was sold.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
start of everything.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines
what the tarot card means--

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:84%
the individual, the
client, or you the reader?

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: That's a
really interesting question.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a bit of both.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
If you ask me a question and
I put the cards down for you,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I may be putting it--
well, I am putting it down

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of
answering your question.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: So
there may be a way

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:84%
that I'm putting them
down as far as what

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:90%
we call a layout or a spread.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe that I'm reading your
cards because we're connecting

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:90%
on a higher subconscious level.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I call that the life
force, even God.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.875 align:middle line:84%
I don't tell people how to
do God, what to call God.

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:90%
That's your business.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's their thing.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: But I do like
to say that, yeah, I'm reaching

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:90%
you on this deeper connection.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I am showing you what you
already know on some level

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and mirroring it back to you
and making you conscious of it.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Are you psychic?

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: I am labeled
one of Saint Louis' top 10

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:90%
psychics.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm really kind of weird
with the term, honestly.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody is psychic
to different degrees.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I think it's teaching
ourselves to pay attention.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:90%
I compare it to singing.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So everyone can
sing a little bit.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Some people, it's like,
oh, God please stop.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And other people, you
could listen to all day.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people
are tone deaf.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.718 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah, right.

00:08:13.718 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And others, you could
listen to all day.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I've gotten
pretty good at it.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty in tune.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.008 align:middle line:84%
I feel my way into people,
I guess you could say.

00:08:25.008 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right,
let's take a look

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.140 align:middle line:10%
at a clip of you doing a
tarot card reading for one

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:10%
of your clients.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: OK.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
- All right, so what do
you want to look at today?

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.580 align:middle line:84%
- I want to look at
when I'm returning back

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:90%
to work to the post office.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:90%
It's been quite a while.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:90%
- Let's see.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.825 align:middle line:84%
- From the capacity of
how I'm returning back.

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:46.625 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:04.963 align:middle line:84%
So it's not fast, which
is annoying as hell.

00:09:04.963 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:90%
- It's been 10 months.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, 10 months out of work.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:90%
- I feel like I'm retired.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, no kidding.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Here we are this time.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:90%
This is now.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:90%
This is this time next year.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:90%
This is the energy of the year.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the Hanged
Man is in limbo.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:90%
You are stuck.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:84%
What I like to say, he hangs
from his foot, not his neck.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:90%
He's not dying.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:90%
He's got this halo.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So he's becoming enlightened
and learning in the stuckness.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:84%
The Chariot in reverse
is saying you are not

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:90%
in the driver's seat here.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing is
out of your control.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Very frustrating.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And Ten of Wands in
reverse, all you want to do

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
is take up that load
and get back to work.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.530 align:middle line:90%
And you cannot.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:90%
So very, very frustrating.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So the energy of the year--
and when I say the year,

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:90%
basically 2024 now--

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
is the Seven of
Pentacles in reverse.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that you're
looking at all the time and all

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:90%
the effort you put into this.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're kind of saying, Is it
ever going to come back around?

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So as we get into the
new year, Three of Swords

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
says the first six months, it
just feels like a heartbreak.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And then some
things turn around.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.910 align:middle line:90%
So King of Swords.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:84%
A king is masculine
energy usually advocating

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:90%
for you in your favor.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:90%
So he is a ruler.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:90%
He is a decision maker.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And his decision is
Ace of Pentacles.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:84%
It is handing you the golden
coin to get back to work.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:84%
But holy smoke, I'm
seeing like a year.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:90%
[END OF PLAYBACK]

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting reading.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does a
reading generally take?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh, it
depends on the question.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So I could say 5 to 10 minutes
for a simple question like that.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Some people are looking
much further out.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.610 align:middle line:84%
It's been the start of the
year as we're recording.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing a lot
of New Year's readings

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and people wanting to
see their whole 2024

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:90%
and what that looks like.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:84%
That can get pretty
involved, as you might guess.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:23.022 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can tarot cards
be used for ill or evil?

00:11:23.022 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: I
really don't think so.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a
Hollywood notion.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not conjuring spirits.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm not casting spells.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it's a
connection of energy.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
There are times that
I'm not really thrilled

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:90%
with who I'm connecting to.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But that's more how I'm
receiving somebody than anything

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm putting out.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I start every reading asking to
be a channel of love and light

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:90%
and keeping it--

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a
blessing to my clients

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.673 align:middle line:84%
and help them to understand
and learn what they need to.

00:11:59.673 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's not
always good news, is it?

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: It's not
as you saw in that clip.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not always good news.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:90%
But it's a heads up.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The poor
lady can't get a job.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.025 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
Yeah, it's a heads up.

00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And it helps people
to understand

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
what's ahead and maybe how
to change their energy.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So for a longer reading,
which obviously we

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
couldn't show a very
lengthy one here,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I do try to give my
clients tools to handle

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.130 align:middle line:90%
some of these problems.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.893 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you've got 78
cards in this deck you gave me.

00:12:27.893 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go
through all of them.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But like for one, the
Tower, what does that mean?

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:10%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: So the
Tower is a tumultuous card.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.000 align:middle line:10%
It usually feels that there's
something very sudden that's

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:10%
happened, oftentimes bad.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:90%
Not always though.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean it can be something
that's just a shock.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It can show up for something
that's groundbreaking.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the card,
the design is kind of scary.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a tower getting
hit by lightning.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:90%
And bodies are falling off it.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I usually say the
foundation was wrong,

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
the building has to come
down, it's time to rebuild.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had tarot card
readers on our "Coast to Coast"

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.655 align:middle line:90%
radio show, including you.

00:13:10.655 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yes.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have one named
Art Rosengarten, who

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
has developed his own card
deck and things like that.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:84%
How close does tarot echo
numerology or astrology?

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Or is it totally different?

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: It's
all a part of tarot.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the really
fascinating thing.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Tarot aligns with the
Kabbalah tree of life.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Kabbalah is sort of an
all encompassing-- think of it

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
as an umbrella over all
the occult sciences.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And so tarot, if you
look at every card,

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:90%
it has a number on it.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And the numerology is
part of reading that card.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And we've got
mythology in tarot.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And we've got alchemy in tarot
and all of these lessons.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
There's historical stories
in some of the pictures.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of wisdom
and lessons kind encoded

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:90%
in these pictures and symbols.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who came up
with the tarot cards?

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:05.515 align:middle line:90%
Who invented them?

00:14:05.515 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Well,
that's a big question.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody knows.

00:14:08.455 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: We know
that the modern deck

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
was created by Arthur
Waite and Pamela Colman.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Rider-Waite deck.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Somebody named Rider was
involved there somewhere.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know him too well.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.990 align:middle line:84%
The Hermetic Order of
the Golden Dawn kind of

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.350 align:middle line:90%
oversaw all of that.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So that all happened
around 1900.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
popular deck that we

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.296 align:middle line:84%
use today, from which most
decks are based on, the deck

00:14:32.296 --> 00:14:33.096 align:middle line:90%
you're holding.

00:14:33.096 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The psychologist Carl
Jung was obsessed with tarot,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:90%
was he?

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yes, he was.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he use
it in his practice?

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: He did.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:90%
And Carl Jung really nailed--

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
he was famous for
his archetypes.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And he had an
understanding that tarot

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
was expressing all of these
archetypes that we've had,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:84%
what Joseph Campbell would
call the hero's journey,

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
that Jung called it the
individual's path of initiation.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And we all have certain
experiences, or most of us

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:13.150 align:middle line:84%
do anyway, just in life of
being born, becoming a teenager,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and finding your talents,
having a mother figure,

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:84%
having a father figure,
having society have rules,

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:90%
having a lover.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a card for
all of these things.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let me go
through these cards

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and pick one based
on my feeling.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:90%
And you tell me what it means.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: All right.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
fact that I pick it,

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, does
that have anything

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:90%
to do with it, the influence?

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.475 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Sure, I mean,
if you're drawn to it, yeah.

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this?

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: So that
is the Seven of Cups.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And I call that the
bucket list card.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:10%
It's saying you have
a lot of dreams.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of goals,
the things in life

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:90%
you most want to do.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
There can be problems
with that card

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
always mean that people

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle line:90%
have a plan to get there.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So I usually tell
my clients that we

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
need to get some momentum
going for the dreams.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't just hope that
life hands it to you.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the cards
work individually

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.260 align:middle line:90%
or in tandem with each other?

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
Both, so it depends

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:84%
on the question you're asking
and the kind of reading.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So some people do pull just
one card the way you did.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And that can-- a
lot of people do

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:84%
like a card for
the day or a card

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.180 align:middle line:84%
for some inspiration
or some guidance.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Other spreads can
have many cards down.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll often look at how the
cards are working together

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and even how the characters
may be facing each other.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your book
"Tarot Life Lessons,"

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:90%
you explain a lot about tarot.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:90%
What does the layout mean?

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:84%
That's funny, I'd like to
correct you on that in the way

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:90%
that I--

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I kind of don't explain
a lot about tarot

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
because I leave that for
the other tarot books.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:84%
What "Tarot Life Lessons" does
is it gives real world examples.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So you're basically kind of
spying on a tarot card reading.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I wrote these stories as
my own journal entries.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:84%
My working title was
"The Tarot Diaries."

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was originally
just for me.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds
like a reality show.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.708 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
Yeah, and I wanted

00:17:28.708 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to remember some of these
more shocking readings

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:84%
or transformative reading
or painful readings.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going
to see real life

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:42.910 align:middle line:84%
people in universal
experiences and how the tarot

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
worked to help awaken
them to something

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:84%
or heal something or just
reveal something in some cases.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But the layouts that
you had asked about

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:90%
are a part of it, of course.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the question,
depending on the situation,

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I will use different layouts,
which that's mostly intuitive.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.365 align:middle line:90%
I just kind of know what to use.

00:18:05.365 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Julia,
let's take a look

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
at a video example
of how you change

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
the tarot layout depending
on the client's question.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:90%
- All right.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.670 align:middle line:90%
So new place for Daria.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It's is a different spread.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:90%
- Whoa.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:90%
- Look at this.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:90%
- I mean, you're seeing it all.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So first, Ace of Pentacles,
this is a new opportunity

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:90%
being handed to you.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
You see that little gate into
the meadows, into the mountains?

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:43.595 align:middle line:90%
- So Ace of Pentacles.

00:18:43.595 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:90%
- That's my house.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:45.930 align:middle line:90%
- It's right behind there.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
- And Four of Wands in
reverse is a moving card.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think you can
do this this year.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the year ahead
that I'm looking at.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:84%
- Temperance in reverse,
you are saying--

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you recognize that
country landscape, right?

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And the forest and the
stream and all of that.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like
fresh air and balance.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
In reverse, it's saying, you
don't have that right now.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And as a center,
that's all you want

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:84%
is like that, that beauty,
that nature, that flow.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Strength in reverse,
I like to say

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:84%
no one gets the Strength
card who's not very strong.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.885 align:middle line:84%
In reverse, you
sometimes doubt it.

00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So there may be that
part of you that's

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:84%
like, I don't know
if I can do it.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:10%
But I believe that
anyone who gets it will

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.860 align:middle line:10%
accomplish what they're trying.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.280 align:middle line:90%
So that is fantastic.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And the Emperor in reverse,
I want to just clarify

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:90%
that last one for you.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you had a conception
that it would be cheaper

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:84%
to live in the country, I
don't necessarily see that.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:10%
You are feeling like
it's kind of expensive.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:90%
That Emperor in reverse is--

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a law
card, a society card.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Are you looking to
buy or just rent?

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:90%
- Probably buy.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So that could include
the mortgage rates.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
That could include
just inflation

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing,
Five of Pentacles

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:84%
is in reverse,
which is good news.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
If it has to show up,
you want to see it

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:84%
in reverse, which is saying,
I can get through it.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:90%
I can do it.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I won't be completely
poor from it.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.150 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
- But, boy, it looks to me
like maybe an expensive time

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to get a mortgage.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:84%
You might be kind
of, ugh, that rate.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:84%
But you can always
renegotiate it later.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:84%
You are feeling with the
Queen of Pentacles in reverse

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
that you're giving an
awful lot for this.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But I absolutely see you
doing it this coming year.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:90%
[END OF PLAYBACK]

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.308 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Julia,
how important is it

00:20:58.308 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
for them to tell you what they
want as you pull the cards?

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah,
it's not important.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I can be more specific if
they tell me what they want.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody says--
and I have many people who

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:90%
just want to test me.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:84%
They just want to say,
let me see what you see.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.905 align:middle line:90%
And that's great too.

00:21:16.905 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just broadly open.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah,
and I'm open to whatever.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:10%
And usually, something will
show up that's meaningful,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.873 align:middle line:10%
that affects them in an
emotional way perhaps.

00:21:27.873 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:90%
But I can do it either way.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So I always say, the more
specific your question,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.757 align:middle line:84%
the more specific
my answer can be.

00:21:36.757 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.507 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: And
that was pretty specific.

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do your
psychic abilities ever

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.913 align:middle line:90%
come to the forefront?

00:21:42.913 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh,
yes, I've had times

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:90%
that I will put a card down.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And I will hear something
kind of internally.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And that isn't necessarily
part of the card reading.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But I'll know that I
have to communicate that.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
fascinating, isn't it?

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.617 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever pulled a
card that you wish you didn't?

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: I've
pulled some cards that

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:90%
put me in awkward situations.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading for
somebody who sat down who--

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I had some feelings
about him to begin with.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:90%
And we put down his cards.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And right up, I had the
King of Swords in reverse.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I read that
king as a narcissist

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:84%
when he's in reverse, which
is upside down as it faces me.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know how to-- you
don't want to just tell somebody

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:10%
that they're a bad person.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:84%
But I did say that I saw this
energy, this masculine energy.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said that,
typically, this king

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:53.440 align:middle line:84%
hurts people, always emotionally
and sometimes physically.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of
hijacked the reading.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
that's my father.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And I just let him.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.500 align:middle line:90%
I let him go there.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:84%
As I got to know
him a little better,

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:84%
he most certainly did hurt
people both physically

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.200 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah, not a nice person.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And it will show.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It comes up.

00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: And
so it can be hard news

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:90%
to deliver to people sometimes.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they're ready for it.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they know it.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And they're in a crisis.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.580 align:middle line:90%
And they want to make a change.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:90%
This guy didn't.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a clip of
you with a client talking

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
about their reaction to the
power of a tarot card reading.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
- Now, this Four of Swords
is an interesting card

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
because it's not always
the happiest card.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It can be a card
of enforced rest.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:90%
It can be a card of a vacation.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But it is a card of some kind
of leave me alone energy.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Give me my space.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
You just may be
somebody like that

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:84%
who needs some private
time, some quiet moments.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Or you are, this time
next year, very much kind

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:90%
of holding up and resting.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you want more
information on that?

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:06.620 align:middle line:90%
- Sure.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
- I mean, given the fact
that you were in an accident,

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.670 align:middle line:90%
that's kind of interesting.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, I think it's something good.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:90%
We have the Lovers over it.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think your
Tammy is with you.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:90%
We have at the root of it--

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.200 align:middle line:84%
this is-- Ten of
Pentacles is like a family

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:90%
prosperity and blessings.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:84%
The Justice card is usually
something legal and/or something

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.400 align:middle line:84%
you deserve, something
you have earned.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:90%
You have been awarded.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Moon-- whoops,
the Moon in reverse

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:84%
here is a card of healing
illness, interestingly.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.063 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:24:48.063 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:90%
- That's very helpful.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:54.985 align:middle line:84%
- --you are still healing
over this entire year, which--

00:24:54.985 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like
you're doing it

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:84%
with your lover, who was
in the accident with you.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind
of significant.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But it does look
positive and good.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:90%
- Wonderful.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:06.860 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on that?

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
- No, it's just
amazingly accurate.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
As we were discussing
earlier, it's

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
amazing how
something that is not

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
truly in the realm of science
is as accurate as anything

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:90%
I could have--

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I could have told you
everything beforehand.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.730 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's all played out.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:90%
- And here it is.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:90%
- Perfectly in the cards.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:90%
That is remarkable.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:90%
- Great.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.560 align:middle line:90%
- That is remarkable.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:90%
- I love it.

don't believe the reading?

>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh, I don't
think that's a problem for me

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:90%
because I think they--

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.442 align:middle line:84%
I think the reading
shows itself to them.

00:25:53.442 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would agree.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.817 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
There's not a lot

00:25:55.817 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to believe because they know
their own lives already.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if
they're skeptical,

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.480 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to come
to you in the first place.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.438 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Right.

00:26:02.438 --> 00:26:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I have had people who
said-- when we saw something

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:84%
in the future, they said, oh,
I don't see that happening.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
call me a year later.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, oh, it
was exactly as you said.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it happened differently
from the way they thought.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, it's not a question
of belief, I don't think.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:90%
It's just revealing.

fantastic questions

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:90%

>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh, I
don't know about fantastic.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:90%
I have my typical questions.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I think if everybody
just had one question,

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I think it would be around love.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone cares
about love more than--

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Love, jobs, health.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.280 align:middle line:90%
But love rules.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Love is the top question.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And we would rather have
nothing else but feel loved.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:84%
That's just sort of
that core human need.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
I would say it probably goes
back to that God is love idea.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the thing that unites us.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:10.408 align:middle line:84%

All right, so I'm going
to tell you what I see.

00:27:37.832 --> 00:27:38.632 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:27:38.632 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:84%
- And you'll know if
that's what you thought.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.760 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:84%
- First of all, she was
not a friend to you.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:44.970 align:middle line:90%
- Ooh.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:90%
- Queen of Cups is in reverse.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.100 align:middle line:84%
This is a person who's a little
out of balance, honestly.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And Five of Swords in reverse
is a very conscious hurting.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, it could be
looked at as a cheating.

Center card, Temperance
in reverse, I do

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.560 align:middle line:84%
think it's probably
over whatever it is.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this is a
love affair or something.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
She either lied to you or
didn't want to talk about it.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:24.860 align:middle line:84%
- And she is aware that she
sacrificed this friendship

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:90%
for this behavior.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:90%
- Wow, that's unfortunate.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.920 align:middle line:84%
- Yeah, she wasn't
a friend, not truly.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:90%
- And I always believe that.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:84%
But I always just give people
a chance time and time again.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:90%
- Well, my sister has a thing.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:90%
One strike and you're out.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.350 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, I really
need to live by that.

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It would save me a lot
of heartache, yeah.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's what
I really wanted

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:84%
to know because I didn't know
if I was being too stern on not

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:90%
being her friend again.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted
to make sure that I

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:90%
was doing the right thing.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:84%
- No, you were doing
the right thing.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.608 align:middle line:90%
You were protecting yourself.

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.942 align:middle line:90%
And you were having some doubts.

00:29:04.942 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:84%
- So it was something that
needed to happen actually

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:90%
to lead them on out.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:90%
- She was not a friend.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:90%
- Wow, thank you so much.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.110 align:middle line:90%
[END OF PLAYBACK]

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Julia, did you ever
have anybody run out of the room

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.173 align:middle line:90%
after a tarot card reading?

00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: I
have had that happen.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:20.493 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: One time.

00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: It was actually
for a girlfriend of mine.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And she was asking
about her marriage.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And I saw her ultimately
getting a divorce.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you told her that?

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
And I told her that.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.388 align:middle line:90%
She had asked me.

00:29:35.388 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
tell her because she

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:90%
was a friend of yours?

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Or would you have
said that anyway?

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: I think I
might have said it anyway.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But she wasn't
ready to hear that.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Usually-- I mean,
that is-- as I said,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.320 align:middle line:84%
it's happened one time since
I've been reading in 45 years.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So I really don't
think that's the norm.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.890 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that when
people ask me questions,

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:90%
they're usually want--

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.450 align:middle line:90%
they're ready for the answer.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:84%
She was maybe in
some denial about it.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.230 align:middle line:84%
But like I said,
she still asked me.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever regretted
giving somebody a reading?

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.092 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: I can't
say that I have, no.

00:30:17.092 --> 00:30:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
are what they are.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.633 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: They are.

00:30:19.633 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And I believe I'm
channeling something

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:84%
from a higher level that is
important for that person

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.340 align:middle line:90%
to know.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever turned
down somebody for a reading?

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: I have.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I generally-- I've learned the
hard way not to read for drunks.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm employed for a lot of
events, a lot of parties.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They show up drunk?

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.155 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
Some at parties.

00:30:41.155 --> 00:30:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they can be drunk.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I like to say there's a
reason they call it spirits.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the most annoying thing.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll ask me the same
question three times over.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.730 align:middle line:90%
They'll get hysterical.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:90%
They'll holler everything.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't remember
what I just told them.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.312 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about my life.

00:30:59.312 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah,
yeah, it's awful,

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.927 align:middle line:90%
not what I want to do.

00:31:01.927 --> 00:31:03.302 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, you
don't want that.

00:31:03.302 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't need that.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Do they get belligerent?

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Occasionally.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Probably one of the worst
people I ever read for--

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and this is going back
probably 15 years now.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think I really
attract people like this

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:90%
But I did a public event.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was paid for by
the host of this event.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody got
their reading free.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's a different
kind of audience

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.832 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
invested in it personally.

00:31:31.832 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They want fun.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
Yeah, they want fun.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.670 align:middle line:84%
They're not invested
in it personally.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:90%
So they have nothing to lose.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:90%
And this guy sat down.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And he threw my
cards in my face.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.110 align:middle line:90%
And he--

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Literally?

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:44.775 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Literally.

00:31:44.775 --> 00:31:47.482 align:middle line:84%
He said, these are nothing but
a bunch of pieces of cardboard.

00:31:47.482 --> 00:31:48.690 align:middle line:90%
And he threw them in my face.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why was he even
there in the first place?

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Exactly.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Why was he there?

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:90%
He--

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Party pooper.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: --just
wanted to be a jerk.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But that was maybe the worst
person I ever read for.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.060 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:90%
I didn't read for him, really.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I just wished him well.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And off he went.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And I had to pick
up all my cards.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Julia, what
are oracle cards compared

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.810 align:middle line:90%
to tarot cards?

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oracle
cards are something--

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.485 align:middle line:90%
it's a whole different system.

00:32:16.485 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:90%
It really isn't the system.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Same
cards or different?

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
No, very different.

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So oracle cards, sometimes
they just have one word.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they have an
affirmation or a quote.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But they're just--
you pick something.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And you might get a
word like community.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, OK,
so today I have

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.220 align:middle line:84%
to work on building
community or however

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.320 align:middle line:84%
you want to apply
it to yourself.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Oracle cards are very different.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Tarot-- I have my structure.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:90%
I have my system.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I have the way the cards
relate to each other.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Right side up, they
mean something.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Upside down, they
mean something else.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, tarot is a lot more
involved, a lot harder to learn.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Takes a lot longer to
learn how to read tarot.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, with
the oracle cards,

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.940 align:middle line:90%
why do people even do them?

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh, they
can be fun in their way.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Some people like just
to have, like I said,

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of inspiration.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Or they might feel
that it affirms

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:90%
something that's on their mind.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just a one card little bit
of wisdom, kind of bibliomancy,

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:90%
if you know that.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's been a favorite
client reading you've done?

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
Well, all of them

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.320 align:middle line:84%
are most recently in my
book "Tarot Life Lessons."

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I--

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: From Saint Louis.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.807 align:middle line:10%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: From
Saint Louis, yeah.

00:33:35.807 --> 00:33:39.210 align:middle line:10%
And, yeah, they're all
Saint Louis based stories.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:43.020 align:middle line:10%
And I matched a story
with each tarot card.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So the meaning of the
tarot card is sort

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:90%
of the gist of the whole story.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:10%
I start with card number 0, the
Fool, which is my own story.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.500 align:middle line:10%
And then I go into
the Magician card

00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:10%
is matched to a con artist,
the Trickster, a scammer,

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.040 align:middle line:10%
and taking advantage of
a widow, I'm sad to say.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True story?

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
True story, yeah.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I have stories of manslaughter
in there that was hidden,

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.540 align:middle line:90%
kind of covered up.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.562 align:middle line:90%
I have stories--

00:34:14.562 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By the client?

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: By
the client, yeah.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I have--

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.389 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they get uneasy?

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh, sometimes.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:25.989 align:middle line:84%
There's an actual mercy
killing in this book as well.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, there's
some heavy stuff.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Not all these
stories are cheerful.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
unravel these things?

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.527 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Well, the
cards help me to do that.

00:34:34.527 --> 00:34:36.453 align:middle line:90%
So it's all there in the cards.

00:34:36.453 --> 00:34:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
person admits it?

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.703 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: And
the person usually does

00:34:39.703 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:90%
because they're seeing--

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.052 align:middle line:84%
I say the client is sort of
reading it along with me.

00:34:44.052 --> 00:34:45.969 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beautiful
thing about the tarot

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:47.469 align:middle line:90%
because it's so visual.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's one story in there
about a woman who had a gambling

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:90%
addiction problem.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And Wheel of Fortune is in
reverse, like front and center,

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.720 align:middle line:84%
as well as all these
cards of addiction,

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:90%
like the Devil in reverse.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And she saw it.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said I saw her struggling
with some kind of addiction.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.780 align:middle line:90%
And she put her finger on it.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.680 align:middle line:90%
She was an immigrant.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.330 align:middle line:90%
And she said casino.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.680 align:middle line:90%
And she knew it.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you?

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.680 align:middle line:90%
What keeps you doing it?

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: That's
an interesting question.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I've always loved just
the beauty of the tarot,

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.890 align:middle line:90%
the surprise of the tarot.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:32.730 align:middle line:84%
It still surprises me
over 45 years later.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll still put down cards
and just be floored.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I've got some new stories
since I wrote that book.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And I am thinking about a
sequel because they're just

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.010 align:middle line:90%
too good to keep to myself now.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:90%
But I kind of--

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I have a belief since we
talked in the beginning

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:90%
that I'm a Sylvia Plath scholar.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting because
it all sort of came together

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.710 align:middle line:84%
around the same time that
when I found the Plath work

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and realized that Plath had
so much of this mysticism

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.640 align:middle line:84%
embodied in her work,
most especially tarot.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And here, I was a
tarot card reader.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.310 align:middle line:84%
But back then, I was
just doing it for fun.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And my professor and
some others encouraged me

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.570 align:middle line:84%
that I should be doing
this professionally.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:23.050 align:middle line:90%
This was back in 2007.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't really
thought of that.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:27.280 align:middle line:84%
It was always just a hobby
for the longest time.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But what it's done
is it has enabled

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:35.060 align:middle line:84%
me to have the money and freedom
to pursue the scholarship.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And so today, I have this
book coming out in May 2024,

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:43.870 align:middle line:84%
"The Occult Sylvia Plath," which
I believe Sylvia is helping me.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I think she set me up to do this
because I've spent the last 15

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.510 align:middle line:84%
years in the Plath
archives and really

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:84%
gaining all the
evidential material needed

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:59.500 align:middle line:90%
to support what I have found.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.057 align:middle line:84%
And it's just all
aligned beautifully.

00:37:03.057 --> 00:37:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During your tarot
card readings, have you

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.510 align:middle line:84%
had a memorable
client breakthrough

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.997 align:middle line:90%
that just wowed you?

00:37:09.997 --> 00:37:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.875 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most every story
in my book is that.

00:37:14.875 --> 00:37:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's impressive.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah, and
I do many, many readings

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:84%
that are kind of the
more average-- what

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:90%
we saw on the screen.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Should I live in the
city or the country?

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.450 align:middle line:90%
When will I be employed?

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:33.098 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
day-to-day questions.

00:37:33.098 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about their pets?

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Do they ever want their pets
involved in tarot cards?

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yes,
and I do read for pets.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's funny.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.280 align:middle line:90%
I have some decks that I prefer.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a really nice
dog deck out right now.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A dog deck?

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah, yeah,
the Dog tarot by MJ Cullinane.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.160 align:middle line:90%
And I enjoy that.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.300 align:middle line:84%
My favorite deck for animals
is one of my favorite decks

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.940 align:middle line:84%
for people, which
is the Alchemical

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Tarot by Robert Place.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do
the animal cards do?

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
Well, they all have--

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even in the traditional
tarot that you were looking at,

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:10.670 align:middle line:84%
there are some animals
in some of those designs.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But some of these decks just
kind of express animals better.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Alchemical deck,
there's a Seven of Swords.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And in the traditional deck,
the Seven of Swords is this guy.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.610 align:middle line:90%
And he's got seven swords.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And he's kind of
sneaking away from a town

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:90%
as if he's stolen them.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the Alchemical
deck, it's hard to tell

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.630 align:middle line:90%
if it's a dog or a fox.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But it looks like
he's burying his loot.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And dogs, of
course, bury things.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.932 align:middle line:84%
And they have their
little stashes of toys.

00:38:42.932 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They come back and
find it, stuff like that.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yeah,
so it has good ways

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:48.730 align:middle line:90%
to express animals like that.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are sun cards?

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: There is
the Sun card in the tarot.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just one?

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Just one, yeah.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there may
be a sun tarot deck

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.320 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not aware of
off the top of my head.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But the Sun card is one
of the more joyful cards.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a celebration.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a spotlight.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.040 align:middle line:90%
It draws attention on things.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.840 align:middle line:90%
It has a baby.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes, it can
signify a baby being born.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
well, we've got

00:39:12.298 --> 00:39:14.360 align:middle line:84%
a clip of you talking
about the Sun card.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Oh, OK.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.075 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Yes.

00:39:16.075 --> 00:39:17.106 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we go.

00:39:17.106 --> 00:39:17.906 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:17.906 --> 00:39:20.730 align:middle line:84%
- Hello, I thought I would
read for the Sun card

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.560 align:middle line:90%
out in the sunshine.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So the Sun card's
an interesting one.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.610 align:middle line:84%
This became very important
to me during COVID, actually.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Because around about
February of 2020,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.850 align:middle line:84%
everyone's problem
was the Sun card

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:84%
in reverse, which
means upside down.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:90%
And then it hit me.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my goodness we get the
word Corona in Corona virus

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.190 align:middle line:90%
from the Corona of the sun.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Also, check it out.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:53.260 align:middle line:84%
The sun card is card
number 19, like COVID-19.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So God gave me a card
to represent COVID-19.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:84%
That is not in my book
"Tarot Life Lessons."

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But I thought that
was fascinating.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Sun card is about
putting the spotlight on things,

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.780 align:middle line:90%
getting attention.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:90%
It's about celebration.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:84%
In reverse, it can be a card
of burnout and, as I said,

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.590 align:middle line:90%
of COVID.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:20.520 align:middle line:90%
It can be over intensity.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting card with
a lot of really powerful, good,

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and bad connotations.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So my story in the Sun card,
every tarot card reader

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:90%
is occasionally wrong.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.340 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I have
learned is sometimes

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.970 align:middle line:90%
we're wrong for a reason.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:46.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
tell some of my clients

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.470 align:middle line:84%
when my sister was
in a court battle--

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:52.780 align:middle line:90%
and it was a custody battle.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And I kept see her winning
and winning and winning.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't win.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:01.300 align:middle line:90%
And I was so beside myself.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Like, what happened?

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Why did I keep seeing
the cards the other way?

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Julia, it had
to be that way because I would

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.780 align:middle line:90%
have been completely defeated.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I would not have
survived if I had

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.570 align:middle line:90%
known how it was going to go.

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And in an interesting
turn of events,

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.910 align:middle line:90%
she didn't exactly lose either.

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:27.040 align:middle line:90%
They found a mediation.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.200 align:middle line:90%
And it worked out OK.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, I
think the cards just

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.870 align:middle line:84%
tell us what we're supposed to
know, not what we want to know.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:36.670 align:middle line:90%
[END OF PLAYBACK]

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
would it take somebody

00:41:38.337 --> 00:41:40.960 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to read
tarot cards, Julia?

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
Well, I think anybody

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:46.330 align:middle line:84%
can do it almost instantly
with some sort of guidebook.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It might be slow and plodding.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.240 align:middle line:90%
And you put down a card.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.380 align:middle line:90%
And you have to look it up--

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look it up,
see what it means.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.452 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: --and read it.

00:41:52.452 --> 00:41:54.910 align:middle line:84%
That is not relying
on intuition.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But that could give you
some basic sort of thing.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.670 align:middle line:84%
When you're a reader for
as long as I have been--

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very
much a part of me.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.720 align:middle line:90%
It's very internalized.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.130 align:middle line:10%
But I also--

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:09.890 align:middle line:10%
I came to a point in my tarot
career, I guess you could say,

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:10.930 align:middle line:10%
where--

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:14.170 align:middle line:10%
my tarot journey,
where I learned that it

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.580 align:middle line:10%
went beyond the guidebooks.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:10%
And so sometimes, a
picture would just

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.080 align:middle line:10%
strike me in a certain way.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Or I would get that
audible voice in my head.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's new for you?

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.648 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
What's new for me?

00:42:25.648 --> 00:42:28.150 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think the most
exciting thing is my book

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:33.460 align:middle line:10%
coming up in May 2024, "The
Occult Sylvia Plath," which

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:38.440 align:middle line:10%
is the story of all of her
mysticism along with her husband

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:10%
Ted Hughes that nobody knows.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.848 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
include her tragedies?

00:42:42.848 --> 00:42:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: It's got
everything, everything.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like a bio.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
It is a biography.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's a biography
in a life of mysticism.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think it'll be pretty
interesting to a lot of people.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:58.692 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is meditation important
when you do tarot readings?

00:42:58.692 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: It is.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:00.450 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I meditated even before
I came to this show.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of my every day.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Before I do every reading, I
have a very short meditation

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.200 align:middle line:90%
where I ask God--

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.310 align:middle line:90%
I call it God--

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:17.500 align:middle line:84%
to be connected and to give
you the information you need

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and just to be a source of
love and light in a dark time.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
is physical capabilities

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:26.500 align:middle line:90%
when you do tarot cards?

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.750 align:middle line:90%
You need to be in shape, fit?

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Well,
that's interesting.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I realized some
time ago the Trinity

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:38.810 align:middle line:90%
is body, mind, and spirit.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that so
many people, especially

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:46.430 align:middle line:84%
on the spiritual journeys,
they lose the body part.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
just all spirit.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And they don't do so
much of the mind either.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think-- just
as alchemists have

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.810 align:middle line:84%
this sort of three
levels of alchemy,

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.420 align:middle line:84%
where they have the
practical alchemy, which

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.090 align:middle line:84%
would be in the laboratory,
turning lead to gold.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
the emotional alchemy

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:06.430 align:middle line:84%
of rising to their
higher self and healing

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.190 align:middle line:84%
their individual
wounds and psyches.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
the God level alchemy

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.080 align:middle line:84%
of reaching their
highest potential

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.860 align:middle line:90%
and being a gift in the world.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
up for all of us.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think the body,
mind, spirit idea--

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:23.420 align:middle line:84%
we have to take
care of our bodies.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.470 align:middle line:84%
These are our vehicles
for our gifts.

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:29.410 align:middle line:90%
And too many people miss that.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.430 align:middle line:90%
I think it's very important.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:90%
It keeps us well.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.970 align:middle line:90%
It keeps us strong.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:37.750 align:middle line:84%
It makes us examples
in every way.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just a huge
proponent of yoga.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:90%
I do weight lifting.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big walker.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just become
increasingly important

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.605 align:middle line:90%
to me, as I'm 60 years old now.

00:44:50.605 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't look it.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.105 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER:
Well, thank you.

00:44:53.105 --> 00:44:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of that
is clean living and taking

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:57.310 align:middle line:90%
care of myself, yeah.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Julia, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON-BRAMER: Thank
you so much, George.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:02.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:45:02.445 --> 00:45:06.470 align:middle line:10%
Tarot cards-- controlling
the destiny of our lives.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.360 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.000 align:middle line:90%
