00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:17.788 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:10%
We have an amazing
program for you today.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:10%
Pioneering death educator
Gail Rubin with us,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:10%
certified thanatologist.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And the "Doyenne of
Death" shall explain

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.050 align:middle line:84%
what that means
in a moment where

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:84%
she uses humor and
outside the box

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
activities to teach all
of us about planning ahead

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.925 align:middle line:90%
for the end of life.

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Gail, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GAIL RUBIN: Great to
be with you, George.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:90%
in this subject matter?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:10%
>>RUBIN: I got married in
2000 was the second wedding

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:10%
and had a very creative
Jewish-Western wedding.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And we had folks
dress in Western wear.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:10%
And everybody had
such a great time.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to write a book about
creative life cycle events

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:10%
and call it matchings,
hatchings, and dispatchings

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.024 align:middle line:10%
about weddings and births and--

00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting title.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --deaths.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I got to write a feature
in our local newspaper,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:90%
a monthly column.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And the stories about
death and funerals

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:90%
got the most reader response.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And there are plenty of
books about creative wedding

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:90%
planning.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But 15 years ago,
there wasn't much about

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:90%
creative funeral planning.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And with my background
in event planning,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I focused on funerals as the
party no one wants to plan.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You're called the
"Doyenne of Death."

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.825 align:middle line:90%
And doyenne is French.

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:36.825 align:middle line:90%
But what does that mean?

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: It means a
woman who's considered

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:84%
senior in a group who knows a
lot about a particular subject,

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:90%
so.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not necessarily
the dying subject

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:90%
but just about anything, right?

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.275 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Right it could be
in any area of expertise.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who coined
that phrase for you?

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: My brother
came up with it.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did he
come up with that?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: He just
threw that out there.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I love that.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:90%
It sounds great.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I ran out and trademarked the
phrase "Doyenne of Death."

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I find out most people
don't know what a doyenne is.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, they do now
after listening and--

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: And they do now.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --watching this show.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: And
thanatology as well.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:90%
That's a term a lot of people--

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well yeah
what is that subject?

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --don't know.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.248 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:02:15.248 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: So thanatology
is the study of death,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:90%
dying, and bereavement.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:84%
The term comes from the
Greek demigod Thanatos,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:84%
who was the personification
of a good death.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
His twin brother is
Hypnos, which is sleep.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.365 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: So sleep and a good
death are very closely related.

00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the dying subject
taboo to a lot of people?

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.205 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Absolutely.

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: They're afraid of it.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:84%
The mystery of death, if you
don't know what happens to you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
after you die, if
you're low self-esteem--

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.640 align:middle line:84%
self-esteem has a lot to do with
being able to talk about death.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
There are studies that say
that 2/3 of the population

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:90%
has low self-esteem.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of tracks with only
about 33% of people in America

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.618 align:middle line:84%
do wills and trusts,
advanced medical directors--

00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
not ready, are they?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --preneed funeral
planning-- they're not.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they in denial?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Is that why?

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Or they just don't like
the subject matter?

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: They don't
like the subject.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Some people are in denial.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:84%
My father-in-law
says, I'm not going.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.245 align:middle line:90%
And he's 94, so.

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:23.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for him.

00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:24.255 align:middle line:90%
He's in no rush.

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:25.297 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: He's in no rush.

00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's in no rush.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:90%
My mother's going to be 94.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Same thing, drives herself.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:90%
She took a fall a few weeks ago.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:90%
But she's OK.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Oh, good.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But she said--
the doctor told her,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:90%
that's what kills old people.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:90%
You fall.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:90%
But she's not afraid of dying.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:90%
She's very spiritual.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very religious.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And she understands that
there's a hereafter.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.485 align:middle line:90%
Do you get involved in that too?

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: I talk
about it if somebody

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
is comfortable with the
idea of a hereafter.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Really, the phrase is everyone
wants to go to heaven.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But no one wants to
die to get there.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I
bring humor to the topic

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of discussing death to help
break down that resistance.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a license to use
film clips in my talks.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And film clips are
very memorable.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.683 align:middle line:90%
I can make a point about--

00:04:17.683 --> 00:04:18.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are the clips of?

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Oh, I use scenes from
comedies and from some serious

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
films that can make
points about why--

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: About
the dying process?

00:04:28.815 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, no,
about planning ahead.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, OK.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
All right, and there
are some professionals

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.365 align:middle line:84%
who do that for people,
right, death planners?

00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Death doulas are--

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
it's a new field that
is really starting

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:90%
to become more popular.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly women, I notice,
who are becoming death doulas.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
They want to work
with a dying person

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
or and their family to
help them prepare better.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to speak to people
before anybody's sick or dying

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and get people to
plan ahead because--

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That makes more sense.

00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --just
30% planning ahead

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to leave 70% of
the population scrambling

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:84%
to pull together information and
make expensive decisions when

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:90%
they're grieving.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the time to be
levelheaded about these things.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gail, what
is the Death Cafe?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: The Death Cafe is a
worldwide movement that started

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:90%
in 2011 in the United Kingdom.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman named Jon
Underwood was inspired

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
by the work of a Swiss
sociologist named

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Bernard Crettaz, who would
hold these gatherings in cafes.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
You have a little coffee or
tea, some cake or cookies,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.825 align:middle line:84%
and just talk about whatever
is on your mind about mortality

00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:44.625 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: I found out
about that and brought it

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:90%
to the United States in 2012.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the first people
to hold the Death Cafe here.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's in 82
countries around the world.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And there have been more
than 15,000 Death Cafes.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they pick
certain spots to go to?

00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, you can have
it in a physical location.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Since the pandemic,
I've been holding them

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:90%
online as Zoom meetings.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you can
hold it in a cafe.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:84%
You can hold it in a
church or a funeral home

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
or a library, wherever
people want to gather

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:90%
and have those refreshments.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to let
the participants lead

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:90%
the discussion.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But it helps to have
somebody who can facilitate,

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:90%
keeping the discussion going.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on that.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: And it ranges
from financial concerns,

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:84%
spiritual ideas,
physical, fear of

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
physical medical intervention
in the dying process, things

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.230 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But I've heard some
incredible stories

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:84%
during Death Cafes about
near-death experiences

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of somebody
who has clinically died.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And during that time that
they were physically dead,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:90%
they still experience something.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
One gentleman told
me about a experience

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.410 align:middle line:84%
where he was like
walking in a garden.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was a wall next
to where he was walking.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And he could hear people
talking and drinking--

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About him?

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: No, well, just
having a good time.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
come on, come on over.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But he knew if he went and
drank beer with these folks,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that he wasn't
going to come back--

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it was the dead.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --to his physical body.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but he did come back.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And people who have near-death
experiences very often,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:84%
their fear of death
disappears because--

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --most often
they're experiencing

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
something that feels beautiful
and loving and light-filled.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And this guy was like,
I know when I die,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
drink beer with God.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was getting
ready for this program

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:84%
with you, Gail, I was
counting the number

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:84%
of people that have
been close to me that

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:90%
have died since I can remember.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's at least
a dozen people

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that have been relatively
close to me and then

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:90%
two immediate family members.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:90%
My father died.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.730 align:middle line:90%
He was 88, 11 years ago.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.440 align:middle line:90%
My sister died of a brain tumor.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:90%
She was 56.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Oh.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I still have another
sister who's doing quite well.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.800 align:middle line:90%
And my mother is still alive.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But I've lost a lot of people
who have been close to me.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's not easy
because you hear a song

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
that you remember about that
person or something like that.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.845 align:middle line:84%
Do you deal with the
grief end of this too?

00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: I can help
people talk about it.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And grief is something
that is not linear.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not something to get over.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
When we love people
in this lifetime

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and they physically
leave our presence,

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:84%
we still have a
relationship with them.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the grief of
their loss will overwhelm us.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.107 align:middle line:84%
Grief is like an ocean
and comes in waves--

00:09:06.107 --> 00:09:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's tough.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --at
unpredictable times.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, things like
scents and music

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
can set off our
memories and our grief.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it,
Gail, about death

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.285 align:middle line:90%
that scares so many people?

00:09:19.285 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: The uncertainty
of when it will happen,

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:90%
how it will happen.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid of loss.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid of pain.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot of
fear that contributes

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to being afraid of
death that it's unknown.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't be afraid.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Talking about it isn't
going to make it happen.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.875 align:middle line:84%
Planning ahead is a loving thing
that you can do for the people

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:46.675 align:middle line:90%
that you love.

00:09:46.675 --> 00:09:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would like to
go when I go in my sleep.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
in a hospital room.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have
pain and suffering.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be an invalid.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I just want to go to sleep
one night and not wake up.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: That would be the
ideal for a lot of people.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, will
you know you're dead?

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Will you really
know you're dead?

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:90%
I get a question from people.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Then they say, is
the afterlife real?

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I believe it is.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:90%
But if it isn't, you won't know.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:90%
So don't worry about it.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:90%
That's my answer to people.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Yeah,
yeah, well, I don't

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
know if you would know
if you were dead or not.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:84%
My take on it is that we
are spiritual beings having

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:90%
a physical experience.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish tradition,
you're not fully alive

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:90%
until you're breathing.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's the breath of
life that your spirit

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:90%
is inhabiting your body.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you exhale
your last breath,

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that's when your spirit
leaves your body.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I keep
thinking of the actor

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Ray Liotta who passed
away in his sleep.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And you just hear these
stories time and time

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:84%
again where they're fine
when they go to bed.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.620 align:middle line:90%
What happens to them?

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Heart attacks
can happen in your sleep.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Do they even feel anything?

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Or is it like an instant death?

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.131 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, it
depends on how you die.

00:11:16.131 --> 00:11:20.415 align:middle line:84%
There's a psychic named
Tammy Holmes that I've

00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:90%
done a number of sessions--

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've heard of her.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --at her
Before I Die Festival.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:90%
You know about Tammy?

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: She told me
that when you die,

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.920 align:middle line:84%
you leave one of your--
through your chakras.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
heart attack, you

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
would exit through
your heart chakra.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
If you had a stroke
in your brain,

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:84%
you would exit out through
the top of your head.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were mentioning
near-death experiences.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Do a lot of people have these?

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: I don't know how
many people actually--

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Danion Brinkley
had it three times.

00:11:50.193 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Wow, yeah.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I think there are a lot
of people who are probably

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:84%
having them if they do
become clinically dead

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:90%
and then are revived again.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I've read about
is that mostly, they're

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:90%
positive experiences.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think maybe
10 or 15% of people

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:84%
have really scary experiences
in their death experience.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.085 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That seems
like a high number.

00:12:16.085 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, maybe
it's tied to how

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:90%
they're living their lives.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know
author William Peters?

00:12:23.405 --> 00:12:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Yes.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wrote a book
called "At Heaven's Door."

00:12:26.255 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about the death
space and the shared death

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.015 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:12:31.015 --> 00:12:33.430 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM PETERS: The
shared death experience

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:10%
is very similar in phenomena
to the near-death experience.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:10%
But it's different in
terms of the experiencer.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:10%
The experiencer is a caregiver,
a loved one, and in some cases,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:10%
a bystander who
expresses that they

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:10%
shared in the journey of a
person dying into a benevolent

00:12:59.140 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:10%
afterlife.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:10%
So the notion is you've
got somebody dying.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:10%
And you have people typically
relationally significant

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:10%
close to the dying.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:10%
And they, in a
certain sense, hitch

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:10%
a ride with the dying into
a benevolent afterlife.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:10%
The main themes we see in
the shared death experience

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.470 align:middle line:10%
are the sense of journey.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:10%
It's really clear
from our research

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:10%
that the experiencers
say, I witnessed

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:10%
or I observed or
I strongly sensed

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:10%
that my departing loved one was
moving into another dimension

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:10%
that was good.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:10%
In terms of the
dominant features

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.820 align:middle line:10%
you see in a shared death
experience, just over half

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:10%
of our research
respondents say that they

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:10%
saw the dying in the afterlife.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:10%
They witnessed or
sensed the dying moving

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:10%
along this journey.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:10%
And then the other two--

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:10%
I think these are
significant-- is that about 16%

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:10%
report that seeing an elevated
being sometimes referred

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:10%
to as an angel, some
sort of guiding force,

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:10%
but a higher-consciousness
being, non-human

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:10%
and, once again, assisting
in a certain way.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:10%
And then the final one
would be deceased relatives.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:10%
About 13% report seeing
deceased relatives.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:10%
But the most of
the other features

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:10%
you see in the
near-death experience

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:10%
are also present to different
degrees in a shared death

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:10%
The light is present.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:10%
You can have a life review.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.920 align:middle line:10%
There are other features
like heavenly realm,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:10%
sublime feelings.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:10%
Highly, highly
energetic experience.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gail, does the shared
death experience happen a lot

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:84%
with people who are close to
or associated with the dying

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.485 align:middle line:84%
person, for example,
somebody in a hospital?

00:14:55.485 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: I've heard about
a person who was a hospice

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.952 align:middle line:84%
volunteer sitting with
a patient who was--

00:15:01.952 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was dying.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --dying.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And they both-- in their
shared death experience,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of the dying
person and the spirit

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.490 align:middle line:84%
of the hospice
volunteer sitting there

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:90%
rose up out of their bodies.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And they both had very
wide eyes looking at each--

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --other.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.813 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like, what
are we doing here?

00:15:23.813 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Yeah, yeah, and
then the dying person

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
was actually becoming
younger and then went off

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:90%
on their journey.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And the witness in
the shared death

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
experience, the
hospice volunteer,

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.635 align:middle line:90%
came back into their body.

00:15:40.635 --> 00:15:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates that
shared death experience?

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.210 align:middle line:90%
What initiates it?

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: I think there's maybe
an opportunity in meditation

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:84%
to become more aware of
the energies around us.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it just
catches people unawares.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somebody is actually
sleeping in their bed,

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and a loved one or somebody
they know is dying elsewhere.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
You can have a shared death
experience that way that--

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it scary?

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I'd want to share a
death experience with somebody.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, I mean,
it seems like it's

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:90%
like a near-death experience.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:90%
But you're not actually dying.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.495 align:middle line:84%
But you're accompanying
someone who's--

00:16:27.495 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not,
but they might be.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Right,
right, but I think

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe this happens
to people who are

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
a little more spiritually open
to the energies of the universe

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:90%
to experience it.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:90%
I would love to experience it.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:90%
I've had my aunt die recently.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
A good friend of
mine died recently.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, will I have
a shared death experience

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:90%
with them?

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't happen.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It didn't happen.

00:16:51.225 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: No.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to--

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: I don't think--

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
can make it happen.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You touched
on this earlier,

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:90%
but what is a death doula?

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: So death
doulas are primarily

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
women who are trained to
help a dying person prepare

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:90%
for their death.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're like
midwives to the dying?

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Right, exactly.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.519 align:middle line:84%
A birth doula-- a doula was
originally for helping women

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:90%
give birth.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: And dying is
exactly the opposite

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:84%
of coming into this world,
it's going out of this world.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Over the past
century and a half,

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
this society has
gotten very good

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
at pushing death away and
tucking it into funeral homes

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:90%
and into hospitals.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is a way to
help people to plan ahead

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
for it, not just practically,
but also spiritually.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And hospices are very good
at helping people with that.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
a lot of people,

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to go
on hospice because that

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.690 align:middle line:90%
means I'm going to die.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're all
going to die, anyway.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's going to happen.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: We do have a 100%--

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's going to happen.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.273 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --mortality rate.

00:17:56.273 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But hospice provides
so much support

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
to the family to
help support them

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.030 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
person who's dying.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you like to
experience a shared death

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: I'd like that.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd be fascinated,
it would definitely

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.645 align:middle line:84%
add to my "Doyenne of
Death" credentials.

00:18:17.645 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What brings you back
from the dead in the shared

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:90%
death experience?

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, it seems like
you're just accompanying

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:90%
the person part of the way.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And then when they get to--

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.115 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But who sends you
back, though, or stops the trip?

00:18:34.115 --> 00:18:35.055 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: I don't know.

00:18:35.055 --> 00:18:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: It's a mystery.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the Before
I Die Festival concept?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: There has been a rise
in death discussion movements

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle line:84%
ever since I started doing
this, really, in 2010.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The Before I Die Festival,
it could be a day.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.290 align:middle line:90%
It could be a week.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
month of activities

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
that get people to talk about
our 100% mortality rate.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.627 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:19:04.627 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It opens up
people, I guess, right?

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: It opens up people.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:13.150 align:middle line:84%
It can be theater, movies,
speakers, field trips,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:84%
behind-the-scenes tours at
funeral homes and cemeteries.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I've found
being the "Doyenne of Death"

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:84%
is that funeral
directors actually have

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.575 align:middle line:90%
a really great sense of humor.

00:19:25.575 --> 00:19:26.375 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: But when they have
to deal with a family that's

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
already had a death
in the family,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:84%
they have to be
somber and solicitous

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and not cracking jokes, unless
the family is cracking jokes.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
do with the Before

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I Die Festival is to get
people to a funeral home

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:84%
to meet these people while
they can crack jokes.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:84%
When death seems like
a distant possibility,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that's when we can
laugh about it.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
learn what we need

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to do to help our loved
ones before we die.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure I'd want a
funeral director to crack jokes

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:84%
about my deceased
family members.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well,
that's exactly right.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:84%
They don't do that when you've
got a dead person that you

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:90%
have to make arrangements for.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.832 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope they don't.

00:20:15.832 --> 00:20:18.995 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: No, no,
that's why their--

00:20:18.995 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:84%
the concept is usually
of somebody somber.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And people tend
to avoid them too.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Because then, oh, funeral
directors, that means death.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:90%
And we want to avoid death.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So my approach is
to, let's laugh

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and let's learn well
before anybody's dead.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gail, what is
a upon my death letter?

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:10%
>>RUBIN: My friend Gary had
written an upon my death letter

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:10%
because--

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.015 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it like a will?

00:20:48.015 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:10%
>>RUBIN: No, it's more like--

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:10%
well, Gary was a bachelor.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have any kids,
didn't own a house.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:84%
He wrote out this
letter to his sister,

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:84%
giving her the
details of what would

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:90%
need to be done when he died.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Upon his death.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Upon his death.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
He wrote down all the accounts,
his bank account, utilities,

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:90%
his retirement pension.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where things are.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Where things are,
where to find his preplanned

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.925 align:middle line:90%
cremation papers that he had--

00:21:21.925 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look in the
mattress for all my cash.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Look in this
particular drawer,

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%
yes, for all of the papers.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was so helpful when
Gary died that he knew--

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:90%
That makes--

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: And--

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --a lot of sense.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: But people's
lives are probably

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:84%
more complicated than
my friend Gary's was.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's what you can help
provide a guiding letter

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:90%
for your loved ones.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is something
called the wall or window

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:53.570 align:middle line:90%
theory?

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Is death a
wall that when you die,

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:90%
boom, you run into the wall.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.290 align:middle line:90%
You're dead.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:00.725 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:22:00.725 --> 00:22:01.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:22:01.525 --> 00:22:04.488 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Or is death a
window that opens and--

00:22:04.488 --> 00:22:05.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Other things.

00:22:05.405 --> 00:22:07.085 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: To other things, yes.

00:22:07.085 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you think?

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: I think it's a window.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've been
taught that, haven't we?

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: But there
are people who,

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
like my friend Gary who believed
when you're dead, you're done.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:90%
And yet--

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.897 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some
people believe that.

00:22:22.897 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: And that's fine.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:90%
But then they die.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they find
out they were wrong.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that sad not to
believe in the afterlife?

00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: I don't think it's sad.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it's what
people believe.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One theory
I heard years ago,

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Gail, was that religions
created the afterlife

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.140 align:middle line:84%
to give people hope and
to give them something

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:90%
to live by a better life.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
If you know you're going
to go to heaven or hell

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:84%
based on the way you
live in your life,

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
adjust that mostly.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And they think that's
what religions created.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And that it really
doesn't exist.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:90%
How would you answer that?

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Yes, I can see
that religions would want

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.705 align:middle line:84%
to influence people's
behavior with the promise of--

00:23:13.705 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everlasting.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --everlasting life.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we have
everlasting life.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We're not just these bags
of meat walking around.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:90%
They house our spirits.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:90%
And our spirits are eternal.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think we live multiple
lifetimes as our spirits

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:84%
coming back and
learning more things.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:90%
So reincarnation.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned my friend Gary.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:84%
He was one of those people
who believed death is a wall.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:90%
You're dead.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I had a
dream like two days

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
after he died, that he
came and visited me.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:90%
He looked great.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:90%
He was in his golden light.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
He was wearing a suit, which he
didn't wear suits very often.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:90%
And he was just smiling at me.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say anything.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.575 align:middle line:10%
And it was a very vivid dream.

00:24:01.575 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't say,
you're right, Gail?

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: He didn't.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're right.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: He didn't.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:90%
But he did smile.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was just him
showing up to say, alright,

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:90%
you were right.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're right.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:90%
He was wrong.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Yeah, but, in
fact, during one of my

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Before I Die Festivals where
we were doing Zoom meetings,

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
I was talking with
psychic Tammy Holmes.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
came through her.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.590 align:middle line:90%
He had a message for me.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did she know about him?

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, I told
her that he had died just

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:90%
before this festival.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And she picked up
on him right away.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:90%
He said he loves you.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, it wasn't
very great of him to die right

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.800 align:middle line:90%
before this festival.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:50.317 align:middle line:84%
And he through her, said, well,
what else were you going to do?

00:24:50.317 --> 00:24:51.150 align:middle line:90%
You're having this--

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --festival, talk
about death, talk about me.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.335 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:24:55.335 --> 00:24:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the
ancients have a better

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:90%
handle on death and dying?

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Depends what area
of the world you visit.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Celtic
people believed

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:13.530 align:middle line:84%
in Samhain, the veil between the
worlds thinning right at what

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:90%
became known as Halloween.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Central America and
Mexico, they have

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Day of the Dead, which
is also at the same time

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:90%
where the dead come to visit.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we would have
pictures of our loved ones

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:32.820 align:middle line:84%
in our homes for Day of the
Dead because the idea being,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.340 align:middle line:84%
if you watched
"Coco," that you had

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.480 align:middle line:84%
to have your picture on the
ofrenda, the altar with all

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:84%
of your family and friends
that you're honoring in order

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:84%
to cross over from
the land of the dead

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:90%
to visit the land of the living.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:10%
And I love that idea of--

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:10%
in fact, what I do in my home is
on the anniversary of someone's

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:10%
death, will put their
picture on the kitchen table

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:10%
and light a 24-hour candle
to kind of welcome them

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.435 align:middle line:10%
in and visit us for that time.

00:26:03.435 --> 00:26:06.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should we plan out
our own funerals before we die?

00:26:06.995 --> 00:26:08.002 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Absolutely.

00:26:08.002 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We should.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: We should, yes.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I planned mine.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: My husband and
I, we actually went.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can put
your arrangements

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.513 align:middle line:84%
on file with the funeral
home and not prepay for it.

00:26:20.513 --> 00:26:22.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you
live another 20 years?

00:26:22.305 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: You still
have your information

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that would go on a death
certificate already on file.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to change
your arrangements.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:84%
There's so many new
developments in dispositions

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that we could talk about that
it's not just burial or flame

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:40.770 align:middle line:90%
cremation.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of other options--

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
water-based cremation,
natural organic reduction,

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:90%
body composting.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to be
religious to plan a funeral?

00:26:51.045 --> 00:26:52.065 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: No.

00:26:52.065 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all?

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Nope.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm also a
certified funeral celebrant,

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:57.840 align:middle line:90%
which are people--

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.132 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck is that?

00:26:59.132 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Those
are people who are

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:84%
trained to make a
memorial service that's

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:84%
all about the person who died
irrespective of religion.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
professional wailer?

00:27:09.015 --> 00:27:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: No.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.585 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:10.585 --> 00:27:11.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:27:11.385 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:90%
You go to funerals and cry.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
You'd throw yourself
on the casket.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: I have done my 30
funerals and 30 days project.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.285 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --we'll talk
about that later.

00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:84%
No, but a certified
funeral celebrant

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.550 align:middle line:84%
can help craft a
memorial service that

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.860 align:middle line:84%
reflects the life
of the deceased,

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.820 align:middle line:84%
their passions,
how they influenced

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:84%
the people who love them, and
their impact on the world.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the reasons we need

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:84%
to have funerals or
memorial services.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It's because we as
individuals have influence

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:90%
beyond our knowing.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:84%
We're active in so
many different circles

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that it takes a funeral to
bring all those people together

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and honor the impact that
you've had in the world

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.755 align:middle line:90%
and on other individuals.

00:28:02.755 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't we
going to eventually

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:08.140 align:middle line:84%
run out of physical space
to put all the dead?

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, that's something
about the Green Burial Movement

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that is actually
helping to address that.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.300 align:middle line:84%
There are green
burial grounds where

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.860 align:middle line:90%
the bodies could be buried.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But there's still natural
woodlands or fields.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:30.400 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the natural organic
reduction process actually

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:36.100 align:middle line:84%
produces fertilizer that could
be put on wild lands, woodlands

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:90%
to help improve the soil.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.735 align:middle line:84%
But the cremation rate
is shot up incredibly

00:28:41.735 --> 00:28:42.610 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's high.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Anywhere
from 68 to, depending

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.170 align:middle line:84%
on where you are in
the United States,

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:54.130 align:middle line:84%
could be as high as 90% of the
population choosing cremation.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:57.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has the technology
for cremations gotten better?

00:28:57.535 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Yes, the retort, the
machine that actually cremate

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:90%
bodies, they've gotten a--

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That they wheel the--

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --lot more--

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.077 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --body into, right?

00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Yeah, you just
put the body in the oven.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.625 align:middle line:84%
And they get toasted
down to the bones.

00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Flames
are up that high.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, the
flames are actually--

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:18.730 align:middle line:84%
they point down onto the body
and incinerates the flesh.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And their filtration
systems have improved.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But still, it uses a lot
of energy, natural gas.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Your average cremation,
fire-based cremation

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:90%
generates 532 pounds of CO2.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:38.275 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow, and how long
does it last, the cremation?

00:29:38.275 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, flame cremation
could take 2 to 4 hours,

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.310 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
size of the body.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intense.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Yeah, people who
with a lot of body fat,

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:90%
it takes longer.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And they have to be very
careful with the temperature.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:90%
I've actually seen--

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blown up a body, right?

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, no,
I've seen-- well,

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.500 align:middle line:84%
you have to remove
pacemakers because those

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:90%
will explode in the retort.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, god.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: The battery.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
could hear that?

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: There was a movie.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I used a scene from a movie
where they actually did that.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.140 align:middle line:84%
They blew up the
retort by putting

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.850 align:middle line:90%
lots of pacemakers in one body.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.664 align:middle line:90%
But I digress.

00:30:20.664 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But the technology for
flame-based cremation

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:90%
has come a long way.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.480 align:middle line:84%
But now, there's
water-based cremation

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:90%
called alkaline hydrolysis.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that work?

00:30:30.255 --> 00:30:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: The body
is put into a tank.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And then some potassium
hydroxide and alkaline chemical

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:90%
is added to the water.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And the water
temperature is raised.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And this speeds up the
process of the decomposition

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:90%
of the flesh down to the bones.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
fall apart, the body?

00:30:48.945 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: It's reduced to the
basic building blocks of life--

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:90%
peptides, amino acids, fats.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's sterile.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's great fertilizer.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So some places will
take that liquid

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and just put it down the drain.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.475 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually good for sewer
systems because it's slightly--

00:31:08.475 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cleans it up.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --alkaline.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:90%
And sewer systems are more acid.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So it helps-- it actually helps
the sewer system run better.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Or other places will let
families take the liquid

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.442 align:middle line:90%
and spread it in their garden.

00:31:23.442 --> 00:31:24.525 align:middle line:90%
And it's great fertilizer.

00:31:24.525 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will technology,
Gail, change the future

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:90%
of health care and death care?

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Oh, it's changing
all the time, yeah.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that with these
new options in death care

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:84%
that people's curiosity
would be able to enable

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:84%
them to ask the questions
before it's needed.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gail, you spoke
to author Todd Harra,

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:84%
author of "Last
Rites: The Evolution

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.070 align:middle line:90%
of the American Funeral."

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And he predicted a new trend
in celebrating the loved

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.055 align:middle line:90%
ones who have passed on.

00:31:58.055 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:10%
>>TODD HARRA: I definitely think
there will be a time probably

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.950 align:middle line:10%
before I retire that, Gail,
you'll be sitting on your couch

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.390 align:middle line:10%
with a set of VR goggles.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:10%
And I'll be sitting on my
couch with a set of VR goggles.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:10%
And we'll go to maybe
some beach somewhere

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:10%
and pay our respects
to Mrs. Smith

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.720 align:middle line:10%
for the loss of her
husband without ever

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.170 align:middle line:10%
having to get up off our couch.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:20.970 align:middle line:10%
>>RUBIN: Wow.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRA: And I
definitely think that is

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:10%
going to be a piece
of funeral service

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:33.490 align:middle line:10%
in the not-so-distant future.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Yes, well, I've
also seen at funeral industry

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.710 align:middle line:84%
conventions holograms of
the deceased prerecorded

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:90%
before they die.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:45.888 align:middle line:90%
That's high technology.

00:32:45.888 --> 00:32:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: That's
high tech, for sure.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how fast
and how far the VR goggle

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:90%
idea is going to travel.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But things are
changing very quickly.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a VR funeral?

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.563 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: That would be a
virtual reality funeral.

00:33:01.563 --> 00:33:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like what
you're talking about.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Right, right,
to put those goggles on

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and go someplace else
and have a funeral,

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:90%
come together in that regard.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But I've never put on
a pair of VR goggles.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.883 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
how it feels yet.

00:33:17.883 --> 00:33:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't like
going to funerals.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't go to a lot of them.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But are there a lot of people
there that are emotional?

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.075 align:middle line:90%
Do they cry a lot?

00:33:26.075 --> 00:33:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: It depends on
the person who's died.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who's much
beloved deserves our tears

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.640 align:middle line:90%
because we love them.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think one reason
people avoid funerals

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.500 align:middle line:90%
is they don't want to cry.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.320 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to feel bad.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But part of being
human and loving people

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.350 align:middle line:90%
is mourning their passing.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's physically not good for
our bodies to repress emotions.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And emotions are
meant to be expressed.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And a funeral or
a memorial service

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:84%
helps us to release our
grief and shed a few tears

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
we love this person

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and we want to
honor their memory.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And pretending that they didn't
die by not having a funeral

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:90%
does no good--

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, you can't do that.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --to the people
who, yeah, we leave behind.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:27.094 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, well, Pete
hasn't called me in a few years.

00:34:27.094 --> 00:34:28.252 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Where is he?

00:34:28.252 --> 00:34:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where'd he go?

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: But also for, say,
a woman's husband died.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:84%
But he says, don't
have a funeral for me.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So thinking she's
honoring his wishes,

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.610 align:middle line:90%
she doesn't have a funeral.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But then the community doesn't
recognize that he's died

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and might run into her
in the grocery store.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Where's George?

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he died.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.739 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Haven't seen
him in two years.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Where is he?

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:52.855 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Yeah, right.

00:34:52.855 --> 00:34:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's like ripping off the
Band-Aid over and over again

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:02.840 align:middle line:84%
when just by having a
gathering where we can say,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:84%
yes, this person died,
we will miss them,

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.020 align:middle line:84%
we'll try and support
your loved ones

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.350 align:middle line:84%
is a very important--
it's a life cycle event.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And people are trying to
pretend it doesn't happen.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.120 align:middle line:90%
But it does.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can understand
a closed casket.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Can't you?

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Sure.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish
tradition, you're not

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.590 align:middle line:84%
supposed to put the
body on display.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.960 align:middle line:90%
It's considered disrespectful.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
other people who

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.830 align:middle line:84%
are visual learners who need
to see a body to recognize

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.430 align:middle line:90%
that somebody is dead.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:90%
My brother-in-law is like that.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:90%
He's an artist.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He needs that proof.

00:35:38.885 --> 00:35:39.395 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: When--

00:35:39.395 --> 00:35:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He doesn't believe it?

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --my
father-in-law died, he

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:90%
wanted to see his father's body.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.130 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.463 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Before he'd believe it?

00:35:47.463 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Well, of course.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we saw-- my
father-in-law actually died.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.260 align:middle line:84%
We were in the hospital
with him when he passed.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was quite a remarkable--

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But he wanted to make--

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --experience.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.253 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --sure he was in there.

00:35:59.253 --> 00:36:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Well, yeah.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And funeral directors
will tell you

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.360 align:middle line:84%
that, that there
are people who need

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.850 align:middle line:84%
to see the dead body to actually
believe the person is dead.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back to
cremation we talked about.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
Todd Harra again who

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.340 align:middle line:84%
echoes a lot of things
you've just said.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRA: When I started
writing the book back in 2018,

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:10%
nobody had heard of human
composting, which is called

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.940 align:middle line:10%
NOR, Natural Organic Reduction.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:10%
And now, it's legal
in four states.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:10%
And there's legislation in
a bunch of other states.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:39.920 align:middle line:10%
And alkaline hydrolysis
is legal in 22 states.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:10%
And for your listeners who
aren't in the profession,

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.590 align:middle line:10%
alkaline hydrolysis is
sometimes called water cremation

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:48.920 align:middle line:10%
or aquamation.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.250 align:middle line:10%
And it's essentially
reducing the body

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:10%
to something that looks
like flame-cremated remains

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.840 align:middle line:10%
but using water and an alkaline
substance and some heat

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.970 align:middle line:10%
and pressure.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:05.986 align:middle line:10%
But what you get back are--

00:37:05.986 --> 00:37:07.880 align:middle line:10%
the layperson would
not be able to tell

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.150 align:middle line:10%
the difference between that
and flame-cremated remains.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do this, this
kind of technique instead

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.610 align:middle line:90%
of just the flame cremation?

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, it uses
a tenth of the energy.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:23.660 align:middle line:84%
It's so much lower
carbon footprint.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't like the idea
of being burned alive, even

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.510 align:middle line:90%
though they're dead.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a warm bath.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.140 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of an appealing
way to be disposed of.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Catholic Church
does not believe in cremation.

00:37:39.455 --> 00:37:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Actually, they said
it was OK back with Vatican

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.040 align:middle line:90%
too in 1963.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but
doesn't the Bible

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.000 align:middle line:84%
talk about reuniting
with the body?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: So the Vatican has
said, you can be cremated,

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.060 align:middle line:84%
but you shouldn't
scatter the ashes.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:84%
You need to inter them in a
hallowed resting ground, which

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:90%
would be a Catholic cemetery.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They should come back.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.770 align:middle line:84%
They've got to be all
in one piece, right?

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well,
there's the prophecy

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.350 align:middle line:84%
of the dried bones where
there's a valley full of bones.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:10.070 align:middle line:90%
And God just does God's magic.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And the flesh is
back on the bones.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And the bodies
are reconstituted.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
the movie that they

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:20.780 align:middle line:84%
had where the dead was in an
urn on the fireplace mantle

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.015 align:middle line:84%
and a cat jumped up there
and knocked it over?

00:38:23.015 --> 00:38:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Oh, I've
actually used that scene

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:84%
as a lesson in why
it's important to have

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.600 align:middle line:84%
a final resting place
for cremated remains

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and not just sitting around your
house even in a place of honor.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.545 align:middle line:84%
But I do have my friend
Gary's ashes in my living room

00:38:40.545 --> 00:38:41.345 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:38:41.345 --> 00:38:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who hires you?

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.720 align:middle line:84%
What kind of person
would hire you?

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Well, I am available
as an informed consultant

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to go with people to make
their preneed arrangements

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.540 align:middle line:90%
and save money.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:57.550 align:middle line:90%
But I also--

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm a speaker.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And people hire me
to go and speak.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And I get sponsorships
to put together the

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Before I Die Festivals that
can help bring people in

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.490 align:middle line:84%
to learn what they need
to know before there's

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:90%
a death in the family.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's some of the
ways I make a living.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.393 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This event is brought
to you by both funeral homes.

00:39:19.393 --> 00:39:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Something like that, really?

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Exactly, exactly.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.645 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:39:22.645 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it big business?

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Oh.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.228 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Funeral homes?

00:39:26.228 --> 00:39:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: The funeral business
is a billion-dollar business.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.768 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Funerals
and cemeteries, yep.

00:39:31.768 --> 00:39:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know some
people who are--

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: They're
dying to get in.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --putting money
aside for their funeral.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that smart?

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Absolutely.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's another reason
people can buy insurance.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I also sell insurance--
final expense insurance--

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:84%
because this is an expense that
everybody is going to face.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't have
savings, getting insurance

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.440 align:middle line:84%
that you can pay for
on a monthly basis

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.340 align:middle line:90%
can make it affordable because--

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When that time comes.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.360 align:middle line:84%
How much does a
funeral generally--

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Cost?

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.011 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --cost?

00:40:05.011 --> 00:40:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: It's kind of
like what does a car cost.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It depends how many
features you want.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An average funeral.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Well, I'll tell you--

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without
a lot of options.

00:40:14.527 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --my husband
and I went to preplan.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And the funeral
part of it is we are

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:24.850 align:middle line:84%
spending $9,000 on
wicker basket, caskets,

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:25.880 align:middle line:90%
and funeral services.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not outrageous.

00:40:28.615 --> 00:40:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Plus, the burial plot
is about a couple thousand

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.000 align:middle line:90%
dollars.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Plus--

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The tombstone.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: --opening and closing
the grave and the memorial

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.680 align:middle line:90%
marker.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:43.127 align:middle line:84%
You're probably looking at
about $15,000 to $20,000.

00:40:43.127 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a
friend of mine, Gail,

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:84%
who had an aunt who had
a quarter million dollars

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.680 align:middle line:90%
in her will for him.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.160 align:middle line:90%
And she was in her 90s.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And I kept joking to him,
she's going to outlive you.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.050 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:40:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Oh, man.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He died.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.680 align:middle line:84%
She died about three
months after he died.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.000 align:middle line:90%
He would have gotten it all.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:90%
His sister got it.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Oh, man.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's all
about timing, isn't it?

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: Absolutely.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.830 align:middle line:84%
But talking about it too, my
motto is talking about sex

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:16.830 align:middle line:90%
won't make you pregnant.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Talking about funerals
won't make you dead.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about
it for 15 years now.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And so far, so good.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
getting younger.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: I really encourage
people to talk about these

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:34.330 align:middle line:84%
things, what they might want
should they be in a serious

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.610 align:middle line:84%
medical condition
and not be able--

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:37.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sure,
when that happens.

00:41:37.985 --> 00:41:41.680 align:middle line:10%
>>RUBIN: And you need to
have paperwork to have

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.790 align:middle line:10%
somebody speak on your behalf.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.590 align:middle line:10%
So make your advanced
medical directives.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:10%
If you've got
property, make a will.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.650 align:middle line:10%
Because if you
don't have a will,

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:56.290 align:middle line:10%
the state has one for you.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And your stuff
might go to people--

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they'll take over.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --you don't want,

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RUBIN: --necessarily to get.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gail, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RUBIN: Thank
you for having me.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're in no rush
to go to the other side.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:10%
But when that day happens--

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.810 align:middle line:10%
and it's going to
happen to all of us--

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:12.970 align:middle line:10%
you need to be prepared.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
