>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.095 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.610 align:middle line:84%

>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
we have, literally,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:10%
a hot program for you today,
spontaneous human combustion.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Larry Arnold, our
special guest, he's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:84%
the director of the ParaScience
International Group.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
They have been investigating
these cases since 1973.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Now you might ask, what is
spontaneous human combustion?

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's ask
Larry about that.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Larry, first of all,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY ARNOLD:
Thank you, George.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:84%
A pleasure and privilege
to be with you today.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we have
talked on "Coast to Coast"

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:84%
over the years about
this subject matter,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I get more emails afterwards
from so many people

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:84%
because they're just
baffled by this.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Explain what this is,
spontaneous human combustion.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Great place to start.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:10%
Spontaneous human
combustion is the ability

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:10%
of a person to smoke,
blister, or burn

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:10%
in the absence of contact with
a known, identifiable, nearby

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:10%
burn agent.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
If one rules out radiant heat,
high amperage electricity,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:84%
caustic chemicals, or an
open flame ignition source,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.967 align:middle line:84%
then by definition
one has to consider

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
the concept of spontaneous
human combustion,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:84%
when someone burns
sometimes completely,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.520 align:middle line:84%
more thoroughly than
can be accomplished even

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:90%
in a crematorium retort.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they might be
sitting in a chair, on a couch,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:90%
in a car, someplace.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.366 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden, poof?

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: This happens when
people are sitting or driving

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.515 align:middle line:90%
in an automobile.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Happens when they're sitting
watching television at home.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Happens when they're
lying in bed.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Even happens when they're on a
boat in the middle of a lake.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Now how many of these
people might have cigarettes

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.310 align:middle line:84%
with them, and they fall
asleep, and maybe it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:90%
catches fire on the couch?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.935 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It's certainly
possible that some of them

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:90%
are smokers, absolutely yes.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
But the question then becomes,
can a dropped cigarette

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
produce enough heat and
energy to literally dehydrate

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
the person who drops the
cigarette onto his or her body?

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Our answer to that is no.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
We've done
experimentation trying

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.545 align:middle line:84%
to replicate one of
these classic scenes

00:02:37.545 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
of spontaneous human combustion
with an external ignition

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
source, such as a dropped
match or a carelessly tossed

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:90%
cigarette.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We cannot consume our
experimental tissues to any way

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%
remotely approaching what
happens in a classic case

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:90%
of spontaneous human combustion.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Fire officials tend to
think in that direction

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:84%
initially until
they've encountered

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
one of these remarkable cases in
their own professional careers.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.972 align:middle line:84%
And then they say, whoa, the
dropped cigarette doesn't work.

00:03:04.972 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
We need to think
of something else,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.324 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have an answer.

00:03:09.324 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been
investigating these cases

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:90%
since 1973.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.159 align:middle line:84%
How far back do
they actually go?

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Great question.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:84%
When SHC was a hotly
debated subject

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:84%
in the 1700s and early 1800s
within the medical profession,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
there were a number of cases
that led medical professionals

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
at that time to
think that SHC really

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.150 align:middle line:84%
was a phenomenon that they
had to come to terms with.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Our research dates the
phenomenon even earlier

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:84%
The earliest case we found in
the medical literature dates

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
to the early 1500s, involved
a knight named Polonius,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
who was said to be quaffing
several goblets of wine

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
or liquor when he suddenly
exhaled flame from his mouth

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and was said to quickly convert
his body into dry powder.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
showing you pictures

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:90%
throughout this program.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
a queasy stomach,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
you may want to cover your eyes
a little bit, because what's

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
so strange about these episodes,
Larry, is that you would think

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
the environment around
these individuals

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:90%
would be engulfed in flames.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:90%
They're just the individual.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.837 align:middle line:84%
Just the individual
has been burned up.

00:04:18.837 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: That is correct.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
hallmarks that defines

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:84%
a classic spontaneous
human combustion

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
scene from a normal fire
immolation fatality.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
The fire is certainly
localized to begin with,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
almost wholly isolated to the
body of the victim itself.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
All indications
suggest that there

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:84%
had to be an incredibly high
thermal component to this blaze

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:90%
to burn the body to that extent.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet surrounding
combustibles,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
linens, stacks of newspaper,
paint on a ceiling, furniture

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
next to the victim escape almost
wholly intact and undamaged

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:90%
by flame or heat.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
We also find a number
of cases that there's

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
a sweet, redolent perfume-like
aroma at the fire scene,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
or no odor at all,
which is certainly

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:84%
atypical of a normal fire
fatality scene, where

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
the odor is always described
to us by firefighters

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.170 align:middle line:90%
as quite noxious.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
basic characteristics

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
one looks for in a
classic SHC fire scene.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
If you've got those,
you've got to be

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
looking for the
external ignition source

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:90%
if you want to dismiss SHC.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have there
ever been any witnesses?

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
People who have literally
seen somebody burn up?

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Yes.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
factor in our research

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that the debunkers really
don't want to deal with.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.036 align:middle line:84%
We do have numerous
cases, both historically

00:05:42.036 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and with people that
we have personally

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.010 align:middle line:84%
had the privilege to interview,
that speak of witnessing

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:90%
this phenomenon in progress.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Case in point, 1828 in
Brockville, Ontario, Canada.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Schofield crossed paths
with a 25-year-old resident

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:90%
of the community.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.369 align:middle line:84%
Less than two hours later, he
got a call from a blacksmith

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
in town that said he had
discovered that same gentleman

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:84%
standing in a
silver-colored flame.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Schofield
showed up, described

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
the victim as having
been burned to a crisp

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
from the top of his head
to the soles of his feet.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
The victim had the "flame,"
and we put this in quotes

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.730 align:middle line:84%
because we're not sure
that this is an oxidizing

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:90%
type of combustion.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
First off, an
oxidizing combustion

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:84%
should be a yellow-red
flame, not silver in color.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
The fire was put out,
but the gentleman

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
suffered such severe
damage to his body

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.310 align:middle line:84%
that he later succumbed
to his burn injuries.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.564 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this happening,
Larry, from the cellular level?

00:06:41.564 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It may
well be happening

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:90%
from the cellular level.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:84%
It may also be happening at the
subatomic level in a person's

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
It may be happening due to
factors cosmic or telluric

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:84%
that are outside
the body, but which

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
western medicine
and western science

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:90%
hasn't yet come to understand.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the
combustion immediate,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:90%
or is it slow-burning?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I would assume if
somebody is going to combust

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:90%
and it's slow, they can feel it.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:90%
They're getting hot.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Their temperature is going from
98.6 to God knows what level.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It may go to
7,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
if one looks at the
evidence that nanochemistry

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.586 align:middle line:90%
is presenting to this.

00:07:22.586 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Certainly that's
sufficient temperature

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to dehydrate of a human
body almost instantaneously.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
The survivors that
we've spoken to

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:37.160 align:middle line:84%
do not describe an
intense painful sensation

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:84%
in the bodies, the
kind that one would

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.262 align:middle line:84%
expect if you put your hand on
a hot stove burner, for example.

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
They describe to us a tingling
sensation, or a low heat

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.742 align:middle line:90%
that moves through the body.

00:07:48.742 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a simmer?

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Like a simmer, yeah.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.724 align:middle line:90%
It can be instantaneous.

00:07:53.724 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting in a
chair talking to a friend

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.040 align:middle line:84%
or to their spouse, as we
are chatting right now.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly they
notice plumes of whitish

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
smoke gushing from the
flesh of their forearm.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:90%
No pain, no forewarning.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Just literally spontaneously
burning of the flesh.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might they be human
antennas, where there's

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:84%
some kind of burst of
energy from the planet,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
from the solar system, that
kind of beams in on them

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:90%
and they just-- poof-- combust?

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: That's a great
observation, George.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:90%
We believe so, in some cases.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
We believe that there are
energies outside the body

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that, when they interact with
the particular metabolism

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:84%
or biochemistry of
that individual,

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.190 align:middle line:84%
sets up an energy interplay
that causes the body

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:84%
to go into hypothalamus
overdrive, if you will,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
raising the body's
temperature biochemically

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.330 align:middle line:84%
or bioelectrically
as if the person were

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.070 align:middle line:84%
struck by a microwave
energy of great intensity.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.712 align:middle line:84%
But that energy comes from
outside the person's body.

00:08:59.712 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Happens to be where
they're standing or sitting

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.253 align:middle line:84%
at the moment, or
something that comes

00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:07.910 align:middle line:84%
in from the upper atmosphere
or even outer space.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.310 align:middle line:84%
We have cases of people being
struck by ball lightning.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Causes spontaneous combustion.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.246 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain what
ball lightning is.

00:09:14.246 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Ball lightning
is a plasma-like energy,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
electric lightning-like,
but not quite the same.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.830 align:middle line:84%
When we began our
research in the '70s,

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
ball lightning was
dismissed as a mythology.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It can go
through glass, right?

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It can go
through solids, yes.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:90%
That has been documented.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Now ball lightning is an
accepted scientific fact.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
It's been able to be
recreated in a laboratory.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Spontaneous human
combustion was also

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:84%
dismissed when we
began our research.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately for
those who still die from it,

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
it's still being dismissed
by mainstream science.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But when people
see ball lightning

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:84%
coming at their bodies
from the upper atmosphere,

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.497 align:middle line:84%
or coming through a window when
they're looking in a mirror,

00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:58.205 align:middle line:84%
and that ball of energy
strikes the body,

00:09:58.205 --> 00:10:00.454 align:middle line:84%
it produces a first, second,
perhaps even third degree

00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:02.047 align:middle line:90%
burn to their flesh.

00:10:02.047 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.355 align:middle line:90%
Scary.

00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: It's scary.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:90%
It's frightening.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:90%
It's fearsome.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.395 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at least for us,
it's incredibly fascinating--

00:10:08.395 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is fascinating.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Because it
raises so many questions--

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you have a morbid
sense, it's fascinating.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It raises
so many questions

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
about what the human
body can do to itself

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that western medicine and
the fire service industry

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.095 align:middle line:90%
clearly doesn't yet understand.

00:10:23.095 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Larry,
you've brought us

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
several cases and some
pictures of these episodes.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about one
of them right now.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:90%
What do we have?

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Let's start
with Mary Reeser.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.142 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mary Reeser.

00:10:34.142 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Reeser.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Mary Hardy Reeser.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the case that
introduced us to the phenomenon.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:84%
She met her flaming
fate in 1951, July 2,

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:90%
in St. Petersburg, Florida.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
The night before, she was
about 175-pound woman,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:84%
apparently in fairly
decent health.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:90%
She was in a known smoker.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
She took two Seconal
tablets to go

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
to sleep that night in her
chair and was discovered

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:84%
the following morning reduced
to about eight pounds of ash

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and rubble sitting behind
one foot, a few pieces

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.490 align:middle line:84%
of calcine vertebrae, and
what was said at the time

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
to be her head that had
shrunken to the size of about

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:90%
a grapefruit.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:84%
In a high heat fire, that's
not supposed to happen.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: No
surrounding fire damage,

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
heat damage of any
significance, was found.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.990 align:middle line:84%
This was a hot story
in St. Petersburg,

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Florida in the summer of 1951.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.489 align:middle line:84%
And when we read
about it, we went

00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:28.780 align:middle line:84%
to the Library of Congress,
pulled up the original news

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:84%
clips and said, you know, there
appears to be something really

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:90%
odd here.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But we thought, maybe it's
the one exception to the rule

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:90%
that this really doesn't happen.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was a prosaic,
conventional explanation.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
The local investigators at the
time ruled out accelerants.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:90%
They ruled out foul play.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:90%
They dismissed lightning.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Foul play being
somebody doused her

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:90%
in gasoline or something.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.501 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: That was actually
proposed at the time.

00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Somebody suggested that a
murderer arsonist had broken

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:84%
into Mary's apartment,
doused her body,

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:84%
killed her, took her
outside the apartment,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and then burned it, and
then brought the ashes back

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:90%
into the apartment.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pieces back in, yeah.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.844 align:middle line:84%
And so cleverly laid
them out, right?

00:12:05.844 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Right.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Why would one do this?

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
The case that really
enthralled us, convinced us

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:84%
that something truly abnormal
and fortean is happening here

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.594 align:middle line:84%
was what happened to
Dr. John Irving Bentley

00:12:17.594 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
in our home state
of Pennsylvania.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we have
a picture of that.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: On December
5, 1966, Dr. Bentley

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
was found by a local
gas meter reader

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
to have burned himself
almost wholly to ash.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bentley's
legacy to the world,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and what has probably become
the most famous fire fatality

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
photograph now on record, is
one half of one leg lying next

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
to a two-by-three-foot hole
that the rest of his body burned

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:84%
through in his bathroom,
leaving on the earthen floor

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
in the basement below a
pile of ash about 15 inches

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
in diameter, five
inches in height.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much would the
body have to burn, and how long,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:84%
to reduce it to
cinders like that?

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Well, the
naysayers of spon com

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
contend that these
people slowly immolate

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.484 align:middle line:84%
in a prolonged, smoldering
fire for many, many hours.

00:13:09.484 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They die instantly.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: By
burning their flesh,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:90%
burning the fat in their flesh.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bentley consumed himself
no more than 11 hours.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Reeser probably
consumed herself in four

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to four and a half
hours maximum.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:84%
The case of Helen Conway in
southeastern Pennsylvania

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.280 align:middle line:84%
in 1964, we have locked down
the time frame from the time

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that she was known to be alive
until the firefighters arrived

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:84%
to her second floor
sitting room to a fire

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:84%
that they did not
have to put out.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:84%
That time window is
six minutes maximum.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's brutally fast.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: That is brutally fast.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.406 align:middle line:84%
And no fire investigator,
no arson specialists

00:13:52.406 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that we have interviewed
in the decades

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that we have been
researching this phenomenon,

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
can explain how Mrs.
Conway left behind

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
two legs propped up against
the front of her sitting chair

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.302 align:middle line:90%
and not much else of her body.

00:14:06.302 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just two legs there.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.187 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Two legs propped
up, in six minutes.

00:14:11.187 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think they're
in pain when this happens?

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: We do not
think they're in pain.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the other hallmarks

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
of classic spontaneous
human combustion

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that defies common sense,
refutes everything that

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:84%
is known logically about
the effects of fire

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Both the survivors tell
us, and the eyewitnesses

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
tell us, that the people who
experience this phenomenon are

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:84%
exhibiting no outward
manifestation of agony

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
or pain, the kind
that common sense says

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:90%
should be experienced--

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah you
would think by that people

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.711 align:middle line:90%
would be screaming.

00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: By people who
find their bodies aflame.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.170 align:middle line:84%
People who drop
cigarettes on themselves

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.669 align:middle line:84%
and are alert to the condition,
yeah, they're scared.

00:14:54.669 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:90%
They're frightened.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:90%
They're often in pain.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Third and fourth degree burns
are very agonizing normally,

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
but not when evidence suggests
that the cause of death

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:84%
or injury is spontaneous
human combustion.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It appears to us that
whatever is the process that

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
causes this phenomenon
circumvents or decouples

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:84%
the passage of nerve signals
to the brain to register pain.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Frightening.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Frightening, yes.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It really
is frightening.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.488 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: It's bizarre.

00:15:25.488 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Larry, we've
got some questions.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Cheryl from
an undisclosed location

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:90%
has a question for Larry Arnold.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CALLER: My name
is Cheryl, and I

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
was wondering if the human
body can cremate itself

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:84%
biochemically, and
if that would explain

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.990 align:middle line:84%
some of the human combustion
stories we know of.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do you
think of that, Larry?

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Cheryl raises
a very interesting point.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.430 align:middle line:84%
We certainly have
considered biochemistry

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
as one of the avenues to explain
spontaneous human combustion.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
People who reactions
to niacin, inositol,

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.002 align:middle line:90%
which the flesh becomes hot--

00:16:00.002 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Flushed.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.685 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Hot feeling, flushed.

00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:84%
If something else is going on in
the person's body at the time,

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:84%
it may produce in
an extreme reaction

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to those particular
drugs chemically.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Basically any
hormone or chemical

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
that impacts the
hypothalamus, which

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
is the body's thermostat,
causing the hypothalamus

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.690 align:middle line:84%
to kick in overdrive to create
tremendous thermogenesis

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.890 align:middle line:84%
in the body almost
instantaneously,

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:84%
is an avenue to
consider biochemically

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:90%
to explain this phenomenon.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, I would think
that paper is easily flammable,

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and other kinds of
material, cloth and cotton

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't think of the human
body as being burnable at all.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: The human body
is very fire resistant.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Even in vehicular
accidents, where

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
thousands of gallons of
gasoline have been involved,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:84%
in the ensuing inferno, the
victims trapped in that inferno

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:84%
can still be identified
through dental records.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:84%
The body is almost
impervious to fire

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:90%
under normal circumstances.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Certainly the cases
that we have found

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:84%
do not fit the
characteristics of what one

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:90%
finds in a crematorium retort.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And we often say to the
naysayers of our research,

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
if it's so easy to drop a
cigarette or a lit match

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
on a body and have it burn
to powder in a few hours,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:84%
why do crematorium operators
spend hundreds of thousands

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:84%
of dollars on
retorts and filters

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and cremulators to grind up the
bone fragments that come out

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
of the retort, when they could
simply take a $0.25 cigarette,

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:84%
lay it on the cadaver,
have a cup of coffee, maybe

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
a quick lunch, and come back
and scrape up the ashes?

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.172 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't work that way.

00:17:43.172 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we get a lot
of these cases, Larry?

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.565 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is this common?

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It is
not common, which

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
is why it's so easy
for the officials

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
to deny that the reality of
spontaneous human combustion

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredibly
rare phenomenon.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Over the last, say,
450 to 500 years,

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.330 align:middle line:84%
we have about 500
cases that appear

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.349 align:middle line:84%
to fit the concept of
spontaneous human combustion.

00:18:05.349 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So divide that number
into the number

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:84%
of people that have been
alive during that time,

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:84%
the odds of being
a victim of the SHC

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:84%
are much lower than being struck
multiple times by lightning.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about if
people eat something?

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Something that might
be a catalyst for this?

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Diet may be a factor.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Dr. Bentley,
we were told by his caretakers

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that the last three years
of Dr. Bentley's life,

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:36.146 align:middle line:84%
he subsisted solely on a diet
of shredded wheat and coffee.

00:18:36.146 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had
said chili peppers,

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:90%
I would have understood.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: You would
have understood, yeah.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the problems
with our research.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:84%
The kind of information
that we feel

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
that we need to better isolate
the conditions necessary

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:84%
for the phenomenon are factors
that fire scientists don't log

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:84%
into the reports, that first
responders simply don't write

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:90%
down in their incident logs.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So things like diet,
mental attitude,

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:84%
any kind of physical malady that
might be common to the victims,

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
we just don't know about
because that information,

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, is not logged
into the historical database.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.451 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this happening,
Larry, worldwide?

00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It is
happening worldwide.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Spontaneous human
combustion, as far

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
as our research demonstrates,
is a global phenomenon.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:84%
It happens in every
continent save Antarctica.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
It happens more often per
capita in the United Kingdom,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:84%
according to our research, than
anywhere else in the world.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wonder why.

00:19:33.515 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: In part
we suspect it's

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:84%
because the cases are probably
more honestly reported

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:90%
in the UK.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:84%
They're more interested in the
sensational aspect of the fire,

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
so that tips us off
that something odd

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
is happening in this
particular instance.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:84%
The UK seems also
to be an area that

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.840 align:middle line:84%
is a focus for unusual or
concentrated telluric energies

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
of the type that
geophysicists currently

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:90%
don't understand or recognize.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But our research has plotted
the cases of pyro phenomena,

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:84%
both to the human
body and to property,

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:90%
in the United Kingdom.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And we found that once we do
the plotting, more than 80%

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:84%
of those cases can be connected
by straight alignments.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a remarkable discovery.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
cartography of combustion.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Where you are physically in your
body, or with your possessions,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:27.540 align:middle line:84%
may cause you to be more
incendiary than otherwise.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The evidence that supports
the alignment of unusual fires

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
has led us to discover
new cases that we did not

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:84%
know about by following those
trackways of fire alignments.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And also, in 1980, the case
of Henry Thomas in Wales

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
happened after we
plotted those alignments.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And we found his location
of his self-immolation

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:84%
by following the trackways
that we had tracked

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:84%
or plotted earlier
through Wales.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So the concept of
cartography of combustion

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.326 align:middle line:90%
really holds up strongly.

00:20:56.326 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now here's
a bizarre question.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Oh, good.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there are
any bizarre questions.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:90%
What if this is demonic?

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:84%
What if all the people who
got killed, who combusted,

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:84%
were, I don't know, devil
worshippers, or something

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
happened?

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that some
demonic force, the pits of hell

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:90%
opened up and engulfed them?

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:10%
>>ARNOLD: We know for a fact
that all the victims are not

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.270 align:middle line:10%
demonic worshippers.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.070 align:middle line:10%
We've spoken to survivors.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:90%
We've spoken to their spouses.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
We know that that's
not the case.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:38.280 align:middle line:84%
To your broader question,
though, we cannot rule it out.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
In the world of
forteana, one has

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to be open to all
kinds of possibilities.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Until you
get that answer.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Until
we get the answer,

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
or until we find enough
evidence to rule out

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:90%
certain possibilities.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
What happens inside the
human consciousness,

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and how that relates
to physiology

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and processes biologically,
is such wide-open field

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
for investigation
and consideration

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and theorizing that we're
not willing to rule out

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.310 align:middle line:84%
much of anything until
the evidence tells us

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.310 align:middle line:90%
we have to go there.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And right now the
evidence doesn't tell us

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:84%
we can't acknowledge
the possibility of that.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go to
Santa Monica, California,

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
where David has a
question for Larry

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.879 align:middle line:84%
Arnold on spontaneous
human combustion.

00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLER: Hi.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dave in Santa
Monica, California.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
know if Larry thinks

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that a person diet has
anything to do with being

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.069 align:middle line:90%
in danger of combusting.

00:22:36.069 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we were
talking earlier, Larry,

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
about food and diet, and David
has that same kind of question.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's rehash that.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Aside from Dr.
Bentley's three-year diet

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.440 align:middle line:84%
of shredded wheat and coffee,
we just don't have any evidence.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.398 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a great
commercial that would be.

00:22:52.398 --> 00:22:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: It would be.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Do not live like that.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:90%
We just don't have the evidence.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the data to answer
Dave's question in any detail

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:01.800 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:84%
This is something that,
unfortunately, first responders

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:84%
don't file that information
on their incident reports.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.200 align:middle line:84%
If there was a
commonality, we just

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
don't have the evidence
to say yes or no to it.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is science
investigating this at all?

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're doing this.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.390 align:middle line:90%
A few other people are.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.035 align:middle line:84%
But is science really
following up on this?

00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: To the best
of our knowledge,

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:84%
this is an area that science
really doesn't want to touch,

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
certainly not those in the
fire service profession.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:84%
When we have had senior fire
instructors at the National

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Fire Academy in Emmitsburg
literally spin on their heels

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.727 align:middle line:84%
and run away from us rather
than confront the evidence

00:23:41.727 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying
to present to them--

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they think
you're wack jobs or what?

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: We think it comes down
to a situation of xenophobia.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:84%
This is so disturbing to
their reality construct,

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.100 align:middle line:84%
so distressing to
their understanding

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
of what they think
they know about

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.690 align:middle line:84%
fire in the human body, that
many of them choose simply

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.760 align:middle line:90%
not to deal with it.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:84%
When we do find open-minded
fire inspectors, arson

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:84%
investigators, and
we show them the data

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and we explain the circumstances
under which Mary Reeser or Dr.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Bentley consumed themselves,
what we hear first is,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:90%
that's weird.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Very strange.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And now you've got me curious,
which is what we like to hear,

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:84%
because only when people
are open-minded and curious

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:84%
to the evidence that we present
to them will we come closer,

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.070 align:middle line:84%
someday, to understanding
how this phenomena can best

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.985 align:middle line:84%
be explained, and
perhaps even prevented.

00:24:42.985 --> 00:24:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the pictures
that you have shown us,

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:84%
where you can see the leg, and
everything else is just gone.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:90%
It's just gone to ashes.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- it's crazy.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:84%
It really just defies
logic, doesn't it?

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It absolutely does
defy common sense and logic.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the critics of
spontaneous human combustion

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:84%
avows that there
is no known case

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:84%
in which the internal
organs of a human body

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:84%
are burned more completely
than are the external parts.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And that person argues,
therefore, that SHC,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:84%
which would burn from
within, cannot happen.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the case
of Mary Reeser,

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
in the case of Dr. Bentley, in
the case of Danny Vanzandt, who

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
consumed himself through
his kitchen floor

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:84%
in Oklahoma in 2013,
those individuals

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:90%
left behind no internal organs.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Danny Vanzandt did
leave behind his heart,

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:84%
yes, but no pancreas,
no liver, nothing else.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Just gone, powdered.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: You think, Larry,
if we made a concerted effort

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
to get more of these
cases publicized,

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:84%
if we asked for them, let's say,
on "Beyond Belief" or "Coast

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to Coast" on a
regular basis, you

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:90%
would see those cases increase?

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.496 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:26:01.496 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It's
not only possible.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.700 align:middle line:84%
We absolutely believe that
that would be the situation.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
The incident number
would increase.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:84%
We've been told by state
police fire marshals

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that they have known of cases,
particularly in Pennsylvania,

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle line:84%
our home state, where the local
authorities ordered photographs

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:90%
not to be taken.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:84%
They found the fire
scenes that disturbing.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.525 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to have
to deal with the aftermath

00:26:24.525 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:90%
of a detailed investigation.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't take a photograph.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Then the evidence
goes away and we

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:90%
don't have to do deal with is.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't have
to deal with this case.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: We can understand
that psychologically.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But scientifically
and intellectually,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:90%
it's fraudulent.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.722 align:middle line:90%
It's not helpful at all.

00:26:41.722 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get ahold of you, Larry,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.212 align:middle line:84%
if they want to tell you
about some of these cases?

00:26:47.212 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Go to the internet.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Go to ParaScience.com.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
That will give the
person our email address.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Contact us that way.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Put 17110-2899 on an envelope,
our exclusive zip code.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:90%
It will get to us.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:90%
We need to know about cases.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.627 align:middle line:84%
The larger the
database that we have,

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
the better we and our
colleagues will have--

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.251 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're going
to have more results.

00:27:12.251 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: To better
understand what

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:84%
is happening in these
incredibly illogical,

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
nonsensical fire scenes
that history categorically

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:90%
demonstrates do indeed happen.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got to be
frustrating for researchers

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:84%
like you who want to
get these answers.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.534 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be frustrating.

00:27:31.534 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: It is frustrating.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:90%
At times it's also bemusing.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
When we have been ushered
out of the headquarters

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Philadelphia
Fire Department

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
because we showed up asking
for cases that happened

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
in their jurisdiction and
were told that they have

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.860 align:middle line:84%
no such fire files because
such cases, as we're describing

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:90%
to them, don't occur.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we show
them our photographs

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and explain the
situations, and we

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:84%
ask, what would you
do, as the expert

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:90%
in this large city of fires?

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.010 align:middle line:84%
What would you do to explain
this situation to us who

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:90%
is looking for answers?

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And that fire investigator tells
us point blank, straight-faced,

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd go out, get drunk, and
forget about it, at which point

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
we are told to pack up our
stuff and we are escorted

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:90%
physically out of the building.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fire departments
are frustrating.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:84%
We tried to get a
fireman here to talk

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:84%
with him about spontaneous
human combustion.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And once I think they
realized what the topic really

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.795 align:middle line:84%
was, they literally shied away
and poof, they didn't show up.

00:28:38.795 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does that
happen on and on?

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: It does
happen, regrettably.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Our sense is that they have so
much invested in their training

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.670 align:middle line:90%
and in their education.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And if the subject is brought
up at a fire training seminar,

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.049 align:middle line:84%
it's always presented as
mythology or superstition.

00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a joke.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Or a joke.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, these people
simply dropped an accelerant,

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.540 align:middle line:84%
a match, a cigarette
on themselves,

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and they slowly immolated
in their body fat.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:84%
They don't appreciate
the rapidity,

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:84%
the amount of fuel loading
that's necessary so often.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And they don't like
to be challenged.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.150 align:middle line:84%
They're comfortable with
their knowledge base,

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:90%
with their reality construct.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And our cases really throw
that into immediate question.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:84%
That means they have
to learn something new.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:31.997 align:middle line:90%
And sadly, people with--

00:29:31.997 --> 00:29:33.747 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's something
strangely bizarre.

00:29:33.747 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Yes.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:84%
People with PhDs tend
to be heavily invested

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.460 align:middle line:90%
in their area of expertise.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And we come along,
and history says,

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:84%
your expertise maybe isn't as
complete as you think it is.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.101 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I'm glad there
are people like you, Larry,

00:29:49.101 --> 00:29:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that are out there investigating
these unusual circumstances.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's
important, don't you?

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: We feel
it's very important.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a great
deal of knowledge

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and new understanding
that can be

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:84%
garnered from looking at the
cases that we've documented.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Why does the body
do this to itself?

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:90%
How can it be explained?

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.100 align:middle line:84%
What new knowledge can we learn
by looking at this evidence?

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Are there ways to prevent
this from happening

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.110 align:middle line:90%
to people in the future?

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:90%
We hope so.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But as several
firefighters have told us,

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll be happy to contact
you about these cases

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
if they occur,
but really, I hope

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to contact
you, because I really

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.150 align:middle line:90%
don't want to deal with this.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.649 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
to another caller.

00:30:32.649 --> 00:30:34.290 align:middle line:90%
We've got Deborah in New York.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.189 align:middle line:90%
Let's listen in.

00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CALLER: Hi.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm Deborah in New
York, and I want

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.850 align:middle line:84%
to know what role
quantum physics plays

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:90%
in spontaneous human combustion.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
answer that, Larry?

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Deborah raises
a profound and provocative

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.100 align:middle line:84%
inquiry into spontaneous
human combustion.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.110 align:middle line:84%
There is a tremendous
amount of energy required

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to incinerate a
body, particularly

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:84%
in a very short period of
time, something like 34

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.760 align:middle line:90%
million calories of energy.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.720 align:middle line:84%
How can we create that at one
of these localized fire scenes?

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.600 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at quantum
physics for an answer.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And we found that in order to
generate 34 million calories

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:14.600 align:middle line:84%
of energy very quickly, you
have to bring the moisture

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:84%
content of the body up
to its boiling point,

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.885 align:middle line:90%
and then blow it off as steam.

00:31:20.885 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way you're
going to get dry powder at one

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.560 align:middle line:90%
of these fire scenes.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.270 align:middle line:84%
To do that can be explained
by applying quantum physics

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:84%
mathematically to the
energy load that's

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:90%
necessary to do this.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And we come up with what
we've doubled the pyrotron.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.590 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredibly
small particle,

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:90%
behaves much like a neutrino.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Zaps through the
body almost always

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
without any harm or
injury to the body tissue,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:90%
to the atoms in the body.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But on occasion, if one of
these incredibly high-energy

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
nanomicroscopic
particles impacts

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
a quark or an atom in the
body, it blows off that energy

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously, sufficient
energy to immediately evaporate

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:90%
the body's moisture content.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And we think quantum physics
provides a really solid avenue

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to explaining some
cases, particularly

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.370 align:middle line:84%
the classic cases of
spontaneous human combustion.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You started earlier
talking about survivors.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.570 align:middle line:84%
How many survivors are there
with these kinds of cases?

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Far more than we know.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It's been our
privilege to interview

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:35.204 align:middle line:84%
about two dozen survivors of
spontaneous partial spontaneous

00:32:35.204 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:90%
human combustion, obviously.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Now we're not talking Dr.
Bentley or Mary Reeser,

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.200 align:middle line:90%
clearly.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
What they tell us
is that they would

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.750 align:middle line:84%
be sitting having a
conversation with a spouse,

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:84%
minding their own
business, driving a car.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.130 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Peter Jones, he
was sitting first on his bed

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:54.630 align:middle line:84%
on a morning in October, 1980,
getting dressed to go to work.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly white smoke
began gushing out

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.690 align:middle line:90%
of both of his forearms.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:84%
His wife Barbara was
still in bed with him.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
She said, what the hell
is going on, Peter?

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.830 align:middle line:90%
He says, I don't know.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
smell burning flesh?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Did not.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:90%
No odor at all.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.250 align:middle line:84%
She got up and started
patting his legs,

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.580 align:middle line:84%
patting his arms to
put out the fire.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Throw
him in the shower.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: The shower.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And the smoke disappeared,
leaving the two of them

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to marvel about this
incredibly bizarre,

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.470 align:middle line:84%
inexplicable phenomenon that
just had afflicted Peter.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he wasn't
cooked from within?

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:26.761 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: No.

00:33:26.761 --> 00:33:27.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He lucked out.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Yeah.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.190 align:middle line:84%
He got dressed, went
about his business.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:84%
That afternoon he was sitting
in his automobile at a railroad

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.321 align:middle line:84%
grade crossing,
waiting for the train

00:33:34.321 --> 00:33:36.880 align:middle line:84%
to go by so he could
proceed further.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.054 align:middle line:84%
And while his hands were
on the steering wheel,

00:33:39.054 --> 00:33:41.470 align:middle line:84%
for the second time in that
remarkable day in Peter Jones'

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:42.732 align:middle line:90%
life, again, white smoke--

00:33:42.732 --> 00:33:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Started again?

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.064 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Gushed
out of his arms,

00:33:45.064 --> 00:33:46.570 align:middle line:84%
filled up the
interior of the car.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.751 align:middle line:84%
Peter remained calm under
fire, if you will, rolled down

00:33:49.751 --> 00:33:51.000 align:middle line:90%
the windows, vented the smoke.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:51.640 align:middle line:90%
The train went by.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.230 align:middle line:90%
He drove home.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.606 align:middle line:84%
He never told his wife Barbara
about the second episode

00:33:54.606 --> 00:33:56.480 align:middle line:84%
until the two of them
were watching a program

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.800 align:middle line:84%
that we did for ABC
Television in 1980

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.860 align:middle line:84%
called "That's Incredible,"
talking about none

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.510 align:middle line:90%
other than Dr. Bentley.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: And Peter
turned to his wife

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and said, do you remember
that episode last October when

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:90%
I smoked in bed, so to speak?

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:11.669 align:middle line:90%
She said yes.

00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, it happened to me
the second time that day.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.449 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't have the
courage to tell you about it.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And nothing since.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Nothing.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.969 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's possibly a
third episode for Peter,

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:23.434 align:middle line:84%
but neither he nor we are
convinced that it's SHC.

00:34:23.434 --> 00:34:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This poor guy's going
to go up one day, isn't he?

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: He
actually, for awhile,

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:84%
when he traveled he took a
fire extinguisher with him

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:90%
at a hotel.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.159 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he was concerned,
and reasonably so.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you've had
a lot of cases like that.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: We have a few
multiple survivors of it, yes.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:84%
But mostly they're
individual one-offs,

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:43.550 align:middle line:84%
where the flesh will
smoke or blister.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
The most remarkable case
of a survivor that we have

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.510 align:middle line:90%
is Jack Angel.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.949 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he was the first
person that we had the privilege

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.900 align:middle line:84%
to meet who we believe survived
partial spontaneous human

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:53.850 align:middle line:90%
combustion.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:90%
A remarkable case.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.030 align:middle line:84%
He was a traveling salesman
working out of a motor home.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:84%
In November of 1974 he was
on his way to a sales call,

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.080 align:middle line:84%
parked the motor home
outside of a Ramada Inn

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.106 align:middle line:90%
in Savannah, Georgia.

00:35:06.106 --> 00:35:07.480 align:middle line:84%
He did not have
a room that night

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.570 align:middle line:84%
so he slept in the
motor home, expecting

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.700 align:middle line:84%
to get up the next morning
and meet with his client.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:16.240 align:middle line:84%
He overslept for quite
a long period of time.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:84%
When he did come to wakened
state consciousness,

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.690 align:middle line:84%
he noticed that
his right forearm,

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:23.260 align:middle line:84%
down to the fingertips,
was charred black.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Severe third degree burn.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:90%
No pain.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:90%
He looked around.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.830 align:middle line:84%
No damage to the sheets
on which his body lay.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Pajama tops unburned.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:84%
No other damage
to the motor home.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Got dressed, exited, lost
consciousness at the hotel.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Regained consciousness in
the hospital in Savannah

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:44.949 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by a
team of physicians

00:35:44.949 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out how this
guy burned in the fashion

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:47.720 align:middle line:90%
that he did.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
didn't even know it.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.099 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: Didn't even know it.

00:35:50.099 --> 00:35:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Only then, many hours
later, did Jack Angel

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:56.010 align:middle line:84%
start to exhibit the agonizing
pain that one would think

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.630 align:middle line:84%
he would have awakened to, or
that indeed would have awakened

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.400 align:middle line:90%
him in the first place.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:84%
A team of liability
lawyers in Atlanta

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.860 align:middle line:84%
took the case on a
contingency basis,

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.920 align:middle line:84%
thinking they were going to
make a $3 million settlement.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Something in the motor home
had to cause Jack's burns.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, you would think.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: The motor home was
torn down to the grill base.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Nothing could be found.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.930 align:middle line:84%
There was no lightning
storms outside at the time.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No chars, nothing.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: No char, no
damage in the motor home.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:25.360 align:middle line:84%
They speculated-- "speculated"
that Jack Angel had scalded

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.880 align:middle line:84%
himself due to a malfunctioning
in the plumbing of the motor

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.900 align:middle line:84%
home, but they could
not substantiate that.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.840 align:middle line:84%
The case had to be,
quote, pulled from court

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.940 align:middle line:84%
because the lawyers simply could
not meet the burden of proof.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Medical records that we
have from Jack's treatment

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.760 align:middle line:84%
attest to the burns
being third degree,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.440 align:middle line:84%
electric-like in nature,
and most importantly,

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.430 align:middle line:90%
internal in origin.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.490 align:middle line:84%
His physicians
attested to the burns

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:84%
having begun inside
Jack's forearm, burning

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:00.570 align:middle line:90%
outward to the surface.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Besides the forearm that
was burned black to a crisp,

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.660 align:middle line:84%
as Jack told us, he had other
high-energy heat damage wounds

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.870 align:middle line:84%
to his left chest, almost
an explosive-like injury.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Also damage to his legs, his
groin, the nape of his neck,

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and internal fusing of
disks in his vertebrae.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Scalding water will not produce
that kind of a burn injury.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So if we accept the expert
testimony of the attending

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.430 align:middle line:84%
physicians, we
have clear support

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that Jack Angel not
only experienced

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.360 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous human
combustion, but lived

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:90%
to tell the incredible tale.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.360 align:middle line:84%
He's one angel who literally
dealt with hell's fire

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:90%
and came out triumphant.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have there
been cases way gone back

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in antiquity of people
talking about this?

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: If you look
at the historical record

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:59.160 align:middle line:84%
from Greek, Roman,
Norse mythology,

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.530 align:middle line:84%
legends, sagas, with
an eye to accepting

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.880 align:middle line:84%
the reality of spontaneous
human combustion,

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.870 align:middle line:90%
the answer is unequivocally yes.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ARNOLD: It is amazing.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.370 align:middle line:84%
This is a malady that
has apparently afflicted

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.920 align:middle line:90%
mankind for millennia.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:25.970 align:middle line:10%
And yet in 2015, the
mainstream medical community

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:10%
denies the evidence,
denies the concept,

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:35.410 align:middle line:10%
despite overwhelming evidence
photographically, historically,

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:39.470 align:middle line:10%
and medically that this is a
real phenomenon that cries out

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.294 align:middle line:10%
for understanding and research.

00:38:41.294 --> 00:38:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Larry, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.860 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ARNOLD: Thank you, George,
for this exquisite opportunity

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.070 align:middle line:84%
to share our research with
you and your audience.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Please contact us if you have an
idea about how this can happen.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:84%
If you have a case
that fits the concept

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that you and we have been
discussing during this program,

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:01.374 align:middle line:90%
please contact us.

00:39:01.374 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:84%
The more information
that we have,

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:06.510 align:middle line:84%
the closer we are going to
come, someday, to understanding

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully preventing
this phenomenon

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.504 align:middle line:90%
from happening again.

00:39:10.504 --> 00:39:11.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Truly,
of all the stories

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.900 align:middle line:10%
I've covered in my
career in broadcasting,

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.410 align:middle line:10%
spontaneous human
combustion is going

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:10%
to rank way up at the top.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.180 align:middle line:10%
You heard it from Larry Arnold.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.810 align:middle line:10%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:32.045 align:middle line:90%
