00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.840 align:middle line:84%
We have an amazing
program for you tonight.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Jason Padgett with
us, a number theorist

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:90%
with acquired Savant syndrome.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:84%
A traumatic brain injury changed
his life forever and made him

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.223 align:middle line:90%
a mathematical genius.

00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON PADGETT: Some people
would consider it that.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:90%
But for me, it's more--

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
it just makes the
mathematics behind motion

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and behind equations
much more easy to see.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Prior to
this injury, which

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
we'll get into in
a second, Jason,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:90%
you weren't that good with math?

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: No, I had
basically a pre-algebra.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:90%
I thought math was stupid.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I would literally say things
like, when are you going

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:90%
to use that in the real world?

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, after
the injury, how did you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
know that your
mathematical skills had

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.410 align:middle line:90%
changed for the better?

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: So the
very first thing

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that I noticed is that
when things moved instead

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:84%
of looking smooth
and continuous,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:90%
they were discrete and chunky.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So a good way to
think about it is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
like when you're
making a film, you're

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.100 align:middle line:84%
taking individual
picture frames,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.085 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
running them quickly.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it
look like motion.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, we construct a picture
the same way with our brains.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And it looks smooth
because one part

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
of your brain, its
function is to smooth out

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
the picture frames so that
they don't look jittery.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And that part of my
brain was affected.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when things move now,
I see the picture frames.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you get into
physics and mathematics,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
you're literally just looking
at different time units,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and getting those
units closer together

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:84%
to get a better approximation
of what's occurring in reality.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So we're all doing calculus
and physics in the background,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:90%
we're just not aware of it.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, explain to
us what Savant syndrome is?

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: So Savant
syndrome is, many times,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:84%
it's people who excel in one
specific area or a tiny slice

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:90%
of an area.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And everything else is either
average or below average.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's mathematical
skills, specifically

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:90%
the geometry of math.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when those
skills aren't up to par,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:90%
what's causing that?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: I mean, each person
has gifts in different areas,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.790 align:middle line:84%
depending on what part of your
brain has more connections

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and where those connections are
hooked to makes each person's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:90%
individual brain unique.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Synesthesia,
what is that?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Synesthesia is
a blending of the senses

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:90%
like smelling a color.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:84%
People--somebody will say
that smells like blue.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:84%
The part of the brain
that is analyzing smell

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.788 align:middle line:84%
is somehow wired to the part of
the brain that analyzes sight.

00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or I taste
red or something.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Exactly.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This brain injury
you had, how old were you

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:90%
and what happened?

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: I was 32.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And I had some friends
of mine had a few drinks

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.137 align:middle line:90%
at a bar, a little karaoke bar.

00:02:53.137 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And they called me and asked if
I could give them a ride home.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So I went there, had
a Coke, sang a song.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
As we left, these two guys
attacked me from behind they

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:90%
had been singing.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For no reason?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: It turned out
they wanted my jacket.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.568 align:middle line:90%
At the time, we didn't know--

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
wanted your jacket?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I had like a $99 Wilson's
cheap leather jacket on.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.142 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they wanted.

00:03:14.142 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they ran up
behind me, one of them

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:84%
smashed me in the
back of the head.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:90%
It was just a fist.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't see it coming.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt this more--
almost heard this loud thump.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:90%
And saw a flash of white light.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And that flash that you
see is your brain bouncing

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.782 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of your skull.

00:03:31.782 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I knew
I was on the ground getting

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.100 align:middle line:90%
punched and kicked.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.265 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking like
I'm going to die right now.

00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And that fight or
flight instinct came on.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking I just
want to hurt one of these guys

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.177 align:middle line:90%
before I die.

00:03:45.177 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And I grabbed one of the guy's
legs because I was still dizzy.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to bite him, but he
had these big baggy pants on.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
And I cracked my front teeth.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.897 align:middle line:90%
I bit down so hard.

00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did anybody
come to your aid?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: No.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
There was two people watching,
and people were taking

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:90%
pictures in the restaurant.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But one of the guys that
were watching, I looked up

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and I said help.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And I ducked a punch
and I said help.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And he put his
hands up like this,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:90%
turned around, and walked away.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like he didn't
want to get involved?

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Making sure that
he was-- everybody

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
knew he wasn't going
to get involved.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I was
like, wow, I'm alone.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And then finally at that,
we'd been fighting for maybe

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.970 align:middle line:90%
like 30 seconds.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said
give me your damn jacket.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And I literally just
took my jacket off,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:90%
at that point was torn.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And they grabbed
it and ran away.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 911 come?

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:90%
The cops come?

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.045 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, there was
a hospital literally

00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:90%
like 100 feet across the street.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.835 align:middle line:90%
The cops came, did a report.

00:04:33.835 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
They sent me to the
hospital in an ambulance.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And they diagnosed me with
a concussion and a bleeding

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:90%
kidney.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And then a few hours later,
gave me a really strong pain

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:90%
medicine shot and sent me home.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The guy must have
hit you, unfortunately,

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:90%
in the right spot?

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yes.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was right in
the back of the head.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.505 align:middle line:84%
And when you get hit in
the back of the head,

00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that tends to do
more damage to people

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.588 align:middle line:84%
than being hit in the
front of the head.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right above like the--

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Right in the
back, right back here

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:90%
behind this part.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
felt it right away?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah, it was weird.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I heard it and saw it
more than I even felt it.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you crack anything?

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.298 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: No, there
was no broken bones.

00:05:07.298 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
It was just the concussion
of my brain wiggling.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.327 align:middle line:84%
And your brain hits the
front of your skull,

00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and then it does what's
called a contrecoup, where

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.785 align:middle line:84%
it whips back the
other direction

00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:90%
and hits the back of the skull.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a
brain scan, right?

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:90%
You flew to Finland.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So in Finland, they have
something called a functional

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:90%
MRI.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.168 align:middle line:84%
So regular MRIs will just
like you can see a tumor

00:05:27.168 --> 00:05:29.710 align:middle line:84%
or you can see the geometry of
what's going inside your head.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
A functional MRI has the
ability to somewhat map thought.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is it shows how
much oxygen your brain is using

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and where.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So if, for instance, I were
to sit inside a functional MRI

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.238 align:middle line:84%
and I were to play
the piano, the part

00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
of my brain that controls
playing the piano starts to--

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will be illuminated.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Will be illuminated
because it works harder

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and it uses more oxygen.
And they can then

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
identify what part of my
brain is controlling that.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So they had me sit in
the functional MRIs

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and do mathematics.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And they would look and see
what part of my brain worked,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and then compare it
to control subjects.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did
you realize, Jason,

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.722 align:middle line:84%
that this brain injury
gave you new abilities?

00:06:05.722 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: The
first time I noticed

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:90%
anything was on the ride home.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think it was
the pain medicine.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Everything looked very strange.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.563 align:middle line:84%
But the pain medicine
was very strong.

00:06:13.563 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But the next day, I
noticed it immediately.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:90%
I had vertigo really badly.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:84%
When I watched water go down
the drain, instead of looking

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
smooth like it used to look,
it looked like little triangles

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:84%
rotating or more like
even tangent lines

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:84%
with triangles rotating and
getting smaller down the drain.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And when a car would move, I
would see the picture frames.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.835 align:middle line:84%
Instead of it looking smooth,
I would see picture frames.

00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:38.835 align:middle line:84%
But if a car was speeding
up, the picture frames

00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:90%
would get further apart.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And if it was slowing
down, the picture frames

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:90%
would get closer together.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And the rate that
those distances changed

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
was describing things like
velocity and acceleration.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have mathematical
terms to describe it.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
All I had at that
point was layman terms.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So I started trying to
draw it, and I started

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:90%
making up my own symbols.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I went back
to school and found out

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:90%
it was the exact same thing.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you didn't know
at that point you had a--

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:90%
mathematical skills?

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.096 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: I knew
something was going on.

00:07:08.096 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I worried, though,
that if I was having

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:90%
like delusions of grandeur.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
You see some guy who
is talking to himself,

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:90%
and you know he's crazy.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But I was like what
are the-- what's

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:90%
the odds of this happening?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Me suddenly having
these revelations

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:90%
due to a head injury.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I would I would
go back and forth.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:84%
But then when I would
sit down and logically

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
go through the thought
process of what

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to describe,
it would make sense.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this injury
kind of change your perception

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:90%
of the outside world?

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: So the
main thing that it

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:84%
changed was the seeing
the picture frames.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And so when things
move normally,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:90%
everything looks smooth.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Now things always look
jittery and slightly pixelated

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:90%
around the edges.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you were looking
at me, I'd look jumpy to you?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Always.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you're speeding
up, your picture frames

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:90%
get further apart.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And the rate that
those distances

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
change between
the picture frames

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:84%
relative to the speed of
light is your velocity

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:90%
and acceleration.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would my voice stay
the same or would that go?

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Nope.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't notice
anything with voices.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Just visual.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all visual.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Did you think there was
something wrong with you?

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was
something wrong.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
these muscle twitches

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and my muscles
would like vibrate

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.095 align:middle line:84%
and it would happen
hundreds of times per day.

00:08:24.095 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:90%
I started having headaches.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.613 align:middle line:84%
I had vertigo and
difficulty walking.

00:08:27.613 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Instead of things--
it didn't just

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.572 align:middle line:84%
look like things
would spin, it would

00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:90%
feel like they would spin.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And it made it
difficult for my eyes

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to move smoothly
because everything

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.203 align:middle line:84%
looks jerky and discrete instead
of smooth and continuous.

00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
see the world today?

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: The same way.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:84%
It just takes a while
to get used to it.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You accept it?

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.077 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Absolutely.

00:08:47.077 --> 00:08:48.320 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Even though there's
a bad side to it

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and there's been a lot of
medical issues from it,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I wish everybody could see it
because I think everybody would

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
understand it because it's much
more intuitive than equations.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Equations are always
describing geometry.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But geometry is more
natural for us to look at

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and to understand
than equations.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I could
describe something,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and we will later hear-- we'll
describe calculus 2, calculus 3

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:84%
in terms that are so simple
that everybody will get it,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:84%
but it's the exact
same thing as if you

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:90%
went to school for two years.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is is you
can't prove it with geometry,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:90%
but you can still understand it.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Whereas mathematics allows
you to rigorously prove

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:90%
the theorems.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what
point, Jason, did

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:90%
you realize I may be a Savant?

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: What
really, really hit me

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that something big was
going on is one day,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
my daughter asked me how
the television worked,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:84%
because a commercial
for like Overstock.com

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.640 align:middle line:90%
came on and had a big circle.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And she said how did
they make the picture

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:90%
work on the television screen?

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.753 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Oh,
there's little pixels.

00:09:51.753 --> 00:09:53.967 align:middle line:84%
And as they change color,
that changes the picture.

00:09:53.967 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, you're wrong, dad.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I go what do
you mean I'm wrong?

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, how do you make
a circle with rectangles?

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was like wait
a second, you can't.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking at a
rectangle on that screen,

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at a zigzag.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.333 align:middle line:84%
It's just those pixels are
so tiny, it looks smooth.

00:10:07.333 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It looks like that.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: But I can
take those pixels

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and cut them in
half to infinity,

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and you never reach
a perfect circle.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
You just approach closer
and closer forever.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you realize
there was a newer MRI

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.695 align:middle line:90%
machine available in Finland?

00:10:19.695 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: With one of the
doctors that I spoke to,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.153 align:middle line:84%
I remember speaking with Dr.
Treffert and another doctor

00:10:24.153 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:90%
named Berit Brogaard.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And they started putting
me on to these places that

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
were doing studies of
synesthesia and people

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:90%
with Savant syndrome.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you flew
to Finland to find out

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:84%
exactly how the injury
affected your brain?

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yes.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And turned
you into a savant.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.155 align:middle line:90%
- It was an amazing experience.

00:10:40.155 --> 00:10:41.530 align:middle line:84%
There was a whole
bunch of images

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.790 align:middle line:84%
flashing in front of my eyes
that were mixed in together.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Some were equations
that I would draw,

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of different
pictures that would flash.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Some that were just mixed up.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Some that were obvious fractals.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Some that weren't.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
The one that really stands out
was the one with little circles

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.610 align:middle line:84%
that would expand and
get smaller, expand

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:90%
and get smaller.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it
would start to look

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
like it was a right triangle
rotating with the little radius

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:84%
getting smaller and smaller and
smaller and larger and larger

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:90%
and larger.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.785 align:middle line:90%
But it was very intense.

00:11:14.785 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
After a while, it just
started to feel hypnotic.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.407 align:middle line:84%
- So basically
what's happening is

00:11:18.407 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that there's electric
current, like electric circuit

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:90%
inside the coil.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And that current creates
a magnetic field.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So when we place it
against your scalp,

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field would
penetrate your skull,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and it will stimulate
neurons in the brain.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.068 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically
what's happening.

00:11:38.068 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.963 align:middle line:84%
- This one when it goes just for
a second, it just kind of like,

00:12:19.963 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to describe it,
except for just suddenly having

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:90%
your brain being distracted.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Just very momentarily, and
then OK, go back to OK,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:90%
that's what I was doing.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.500 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was thinking.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to think, it's hard
to even describe the sensation.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:84%
- It was quite unusual
to see activations only

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:90%
in the left hemisphere.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.532 align:middle line:84%
So normally like
even in, I think even

00:12:41.532 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:84%
in language experiments, and
you see something in the right

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.842 align:middle line:84%
But it's so uniquely
in the left hemisphere.

00:12:46.842 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:90%
[END OF VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So after this test,
what conclusions did they make?

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:90%
What conclusions did you make?

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: So they
made a conclusion

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
that I had conscious
access to part of the brain

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
that we normally don't
have conscious access to.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that
I had Savant syndrome

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.640 align:middle line:90%
and a form of synesthesia.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:84%
For me specifically, it's
seeing numbers as shapes,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.977 align:middle line:84%
because shapes are actually
the natural form of numbers.

00:13:14.977 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is
still happening to you?

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Always.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I can't stop
thinking about it.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I have I have difficulty
sleeping at night

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
because there's just
so much to think about,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:90%
so much to wonder about.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And the way that reality works
is so much more interesting

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and intricate than what
I think most people would

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:90%
have imagined.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.342 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I notice
on the screen there

00:13:37.342 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:90%
was MC square flashed up there.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Einstein would be proud of you.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So I have written that in a
slightly different way, which

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:84%
is called Planck
constant times frequency

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:84%
equals mass times the
speed of light squared.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.792 align:middle line:84%
But it's still
describing energy.

00:13:51.792 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:90%
They both equal energy.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:84%
But they describe energy
in different ways.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:84%
The Planck constant times
frequency describes it

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of frequency
and light, and mass times

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:84%
the speed of light squared
describes it in terms of mass.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So one's quantum mechanics,
the other one's relativity.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I told
you 284 times 20,

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
would you instantly
know the answer?

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: No.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't do numbers.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure I could figure it out.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I'd be like 1,000, I don't know,
be like 7,200 and something,

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:19.922 align:middle line:90%
280 I think.

00:14:19.922 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we'd all have
to think it out like that.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Right.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.975 align:middle line:84%
But I still have
to think it out.

00:14:23.975 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- like I don't do
like number calculations.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:84%
It's specifically like
if I look at a shape,

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
I still have to sit down
and I can describe it

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.035 align:middle line:84%
to you in the exact
same way in layman terms

00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:84%
because when this
happened to me,

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I had to find a way to
describe it in normal terms.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And so one day, I was actually
in the mall and I was drawing,

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.642 align:middle line:84%
and a physicist
happened to come by

00:14:44.642 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and he asked me
what I was drawing.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm
trying to describe

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
the discrete
structure of spacetime

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:90%
and the geometry of it.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:90%
And so we started talking.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
it sounds like you're

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
trying to describe
unified field theory,

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
but you're doing
it in layman terms.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
He said you have no
idea how weird that is.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
you're not a scientist.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Right.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, have
you ever considered

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:90%
going back to school?

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, you know,
that's probably a good idea.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And a week later, I went and
I enrolled in Math 99 Algebra.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And the very first day of class,
my teacher graphed an equation,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and I said you mean that
equation is that shape?

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:90%
And she said yes.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said then we're
talking about the same thing,

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:90%
just in two different ways.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.647 align:middle line:90%
I'm drawing what it looks like.

00:15:21.647 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:84%
You're writing an
equation that you can then

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
graph what it looks like,
but they are identical.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it easy for you?

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Much of
it was very easy.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I thought that I came
in and I had pi drawn out.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.603 align:middle line:84%
And I had all these
drawings done.

00:15:35.603 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I would
show them to a professor

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and they would say
that's the number pi.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And let me explain to
you how we calculate it.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:90%
And they would say what is that?

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a pretty picture.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I
got to like trigonometry

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and calculus that I could
write it in their terms.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And once I wrote it in
an equation and then put

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:84%
the drawing with it, then
they were like it's--

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
they would agree 100%,
they have to agree

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:90%
because it is the same.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But it was interesting
seeing how they didn't see it

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:84%
until I wrote it in the language
that they were taught to speak,

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:90%
which is equations.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
happened to your brain

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.548 align:middle line:90%
to allow you to do this?

00:16:10.548 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: I think we are all--

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I know we
are all doing it.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.792 align:middle line:84%
So like if I throw a
ball to you, like we

00:16:15.792 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:90%
don't think we're doing math.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:84%
But when I throw
that ball, you have

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
to calculate the acceleration
of the ball due to gravity.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
The arc of the ball, the
three dimensional coordinates

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:84%
of your hand and the ball,
the time lag from the nerves

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to your fingers, yet
you just catch it.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.477 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to try to grasp--
or to sit down and crunch

00:16:31.477 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that equation, it
would take us hours,

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:90%
yet you just catch the ball.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So we're all doing
like estimated calculus

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
in the background,
even animals are.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
To be able to
navigate the world,

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
you are defining velocity,
acceleration, probabilities.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.418 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing it
in a general way.

00:16:47.418 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It just runs in the background.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:90%
So we're not aware of it.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a it's a
function of evolution

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that it's so distracting
that it makes

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:90%
you less likely to survive.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.537 align:middle line:84%
Like if this had happened
to me in the caveman days,

00:17:00.537 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I would have been too busy
and distracted by everything

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:90%
that was going on around me.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And I probably would have been
eaten by a lion or something.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would
have been considered

00:17:07.105 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:84%
the Marconi of those days
or something like that.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some
of your artwork.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned some of
the pictures that you do.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain to
us what we're looking at.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: So that is the
number pi as it expands.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.095 align:middle line:90%
So what pi is--

00:17:22.095 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times people think
it's like this magical thing.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's 3.14.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yes, 3.14159.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But it actually what
pi is describing

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:84%
is this shape forever
getting smoother and smoother

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
as it forever approaches a
circle, but never reaches it

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:84%
because there's actually no
such thing as a circle anywhere

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.328 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as a
perfect circle or a curve.

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And the way to think
about it is everybody

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:84%
who's watching this
right now on a screen,

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
your screen is made with
pixels, which are little squares

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:90%
or rectangles.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So you're not seeing
a curve, you're

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:84%
seeing an approximation
of a curve.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.055 align:middle line:84%
And if you look in closely,
you see the zigzag.

00:17:56.055 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long did it take
you, Jason, to sketch this?

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: That took
months because that's

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.737 align:middle line:84%
720 slices inside of
about a 18 inch circle.

00:18:04.737 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you did
that by freehand?

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: That's all freehand.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I had to shave pencil
lead for each line.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And it has to be flawless.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: So it's
also the rainbow.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
When you see a double rainbow,
that ring that you see,

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.908 align:middle line:90%
that is the double rainbow.

00:18:16.908 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does that bright
light in the middle represent?

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.825 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: It's
just light, light

00:18:20.825 --> 00:18:22.468 align:middle line:90%
bursting out and refracting.

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:84%
You can use this to describe
a lot of different things.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't represent
the sun or anything like that?

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Well, yeah.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
The sun-- when you see the sun
or you see any light source,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
it's going to look
just like that.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
This also would represent
like gravitational lensing.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Or when you see rings, if you
take a camera, a video camera

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and you point it at a light, you
start seeing these weird rings.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:84%
It's how the light refracts
at different angles.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
look at your second photo.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: So this is--

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:84%
yes, this is like the most
famous science experiment

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:90%
probably in history.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the double slit experiment.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's how light, when you
shoot photons at two slits,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:84%
it will-- even if it
goes through one slit,

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:84%
if you're not observing it, it
will interfere with itself as

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:90%
though it passed through both.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So this shows the wave particle
duality that light has.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you show
this to a mathematician,

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.073 align:middle line:90%
would they understand it?

00:19:16.073 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Well, yeah.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.365 align:middle line:84%
Most of them would
understand it.

00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:20.822 align:middle line:84%
Once I say it's the double--
well, if it's a physicist,

00:19:20.822 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:90%
they'll really understand it.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Mathematicians, it depends.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything is becoming
so specific nowadays.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Some mathematicians aren't
familiar with the double slit

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:90%
test.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:90%
But I would think most are.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:90%
It's such a famous experiment.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you been
put under a microscope

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.973 align:middle line:90%
since this happened to you?

00:19:35.973 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Not
under a microscope.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, in terms
of them looking at you

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and then trying to figure
out what's going on?

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: In some ways,
it's more with doctors.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.990 align:middle line:84%
My professors that
I worked with,

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
they were just interested in
the way that I would see things

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
would allow me to find
solutions that you don't-- that

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.220 align:middle line:84%
aren't apparent when you're
looking at it just as numbers.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
involved in these drawings

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.570 align:middle line:84%
than what I'm
explaining right now.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But when you go
into how they work,

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
it's much easier to understand
very high mathematical concepts

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.210 align:middle line:84%
in regular terms when you're
just looking at a drawing.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when we go and we
learn derivatives and integrals

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and calculus and you're
just crunching numbers,

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard for the students
and for a lot of professors

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
to visualize how this actually
applies in the real world,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and what it is that
it's describing.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have your
savant abilities

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:84%
helped you in the real
world or hindered you?

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: In some
ways, in the beginning,

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
it hindered me a lot
because OCD came on with it.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:90%
I had like agoraphobia.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I didn't leave my house for
like 3, 3 and 1/2 years,

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:90%
except for just to get food.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of
depressed for a while.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Panic attacks.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:90%
It was very-- it was bad.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it was--
there was this beautiful part

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
of it because this world
was opening up to me that I

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:90%
had never known existed.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:90%
I was literally--

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I would chase girls and party
and go out and goof off.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And life was very simple
and not very deep.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, it was like
the curtain was pulled back.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And bits of the universe that
I had never even contemplated

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
suddenly were very
obvious and fascinating.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does your
wife think about what

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:90%
has happened to you here?

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.185 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: So she-- I met her
when I went back to school.

00:21:26.185 --> 00:21:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So she never knew me before,
which is probably good.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:30.470 align:middle line:90%
And I was in--

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I was at the
cafeteria in school,

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and she was an exchange
student or she was

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:90%
visiting from another country.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was drawing, and she
asked me what I was drawing,

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:90%
and we started talking.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And she has a lot of patience
because she's listened

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
to many theories and different
theorems over the years

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
at all different
times of the night.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But she's very understanding
and she's very smart too.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to bounce
ideas off of her

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and see what she
thinks of it sometimes

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:90%
before I tell other people.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.037 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
scientific study now?

00:22:06.037 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: In some--

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.850 align:middle line:90%
I have been.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.280 align:middle line:84%
For me, the most
wonderful part about it

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:84%
is just sharing
this with everybody.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like I feel like I
almost like swallowed a star.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.362 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like I'm
bursting with anybody

00:22:18.362 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:84%
that comes by I just
want to talk to them

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.445 align:middle line:84%
and say listen, I know you
think you don't understand it.

00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I know you think
you don't like math.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:90%
But let me tell you about this.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I worked in a store for a while.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:84%
My family owned
furniture stores.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would bring up any way
that I could to discuss math

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.952 align:middle line:84%
with people, because even though
at first I would say something

00:22:40.952 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:84%
about pi and I could see them
like backing up like, oh boy,

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to talk about math.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The only pi
they want to talk about

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:90%
is apple or cherry.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Totally.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:84%
But then within a
couple of minutes,

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.050 align:middle line:84%
they would be totally engaged
because they can understand it.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
95% of everybody can
understand exactly what

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about in
mathematical terms,

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
but in simple mathematical
terms when you're

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:01.850 align:middle line:90%
doing it with the drawings.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally
the same thing.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little
easier to comprehend.

00:23:04.975 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yes.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now joining us via
Zoom, incredible technology,

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
is Dr. Matt Doll from the
SSM Health Treffert Center

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:90%
who met with Jason.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Is based in Fond
du Lac, Wisconsin.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.693 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Doll, welcome
to the program.

00:23:18.693 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MATT DOLL: Thank
you for having me on.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us a
little bit about how

00:23:21.985 --> 00:23:25.483 align:middle line:90%
this meeting with Jason started.

00:23:25.483 --> 00:23:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLL: As Jason
mentioned, he had

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
met Dr. Treffert
several years ago

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and had arranged his
further evaluations.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And then he came out
and visited with us.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was
meeting with Dr. Treffert

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and had a chance to spend
some time with Jason.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of Jason's situation?

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLL: It's quite remarkable
and unique and acquired

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Savant's.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:52.120 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, we see
injury to the left hemisphere

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and greater access to
the right hemisphere.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And Jason's case,
it's quite unique.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
He had injury to his
right hemisphere.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And then now has access to
and processing information

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:90%
more with his left hemisphere.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look at
the brain through the scans,

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.945 align:middle line:84%
does it show things
that are unusual?

00:24:11.945 --> 00:24:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you
tell that there's

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:90%
something that happened?

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLL: Yes.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
You would see that a task
that he would normally

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.490 align:middle line:84%
in typical brains have
occurred on both sides

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:84%
of his brain, the activity
was only on the left side.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And that was looking
at equations that

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.990 align:middle line:90%
were resulting in an image.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Whereas equations that would
have no resulting image

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:90%
only appeared on both sides.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And so how his brain is
processing information

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.570 align:middle line:84%
is different from what we
would typically expect.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Doll, why does
it take some kind of injury

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.960 align:middle line:84%
to the brain to push him into
that other level of being

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.180 align:middle line:90%
a savant?

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLL: I think in
all of the stories

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.240 align:middle line:84%
that we've had from different
kinds of experiences,

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:84%
there's a process where
there's damage that occurs,

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a recruitment
or an access to other skills

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:90%
or abilities that we may have.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It is very rare,
and we certainly

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:84%
don't recommend anyone
harm their head in order

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to try to get
better at something.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But in these cases like
Jason, it is perception.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:84%
He's perceiving the
world differently.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And what he describes
is sort of almost a look

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:84%
behind the curtain on
how we track motion.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And how our brains
track motion actually

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:84%
in his visual cortex where that
injury occurred has changed.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And so now as a
form of synesthesia,

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
he's seeing the lines
as he describes pi

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:90%
as a series of lines.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that perceptional
change is really

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:84%
where he's able to
understand and start

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:84%
to explain math in a very
unique and different way.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we know
what will happen

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:50.010 align:middle line:90%
in the future with Jason?

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLL: You know what?

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Our years of working
with acquired Savant's,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:84%
one of the downsides
is oftentimes

00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:84%
a compulsion, that sense that
I have to do this new skill.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:84%
As that skill is practiced over
time, that pressure lessens.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And then people become
very attached, if you will,

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:90%
to their skill.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's concern that
it will fade over time.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And to our knowledge, those
skills do not fade over time.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:90%
But they do change.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
further exploration.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.390 align:middle line:90%
There's more comfort level.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, some
of the negative side

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:84%
effects of the injury
start to fade a little bit.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But as Jason says, he's
left with chronic headache

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and a variety of other things
that he struggles with yet.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The actor Dustin
Hoffman played in the movie

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:84%
"Rain Man," which reminds
me a little bit of Jason.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Treffert worked
with the real "Rain Man"

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:84%
that Dustin Hoffman portrayed
in the movie "Rain Man."

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.383 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:26:45.383 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLL: Well, for
Dr. Treffert, it

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:84%
was important to represent
these amazing minds

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.920 align:middle line:84%
in the most accurate
and supportive way

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:90%
of their unique abilities.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Kim Peek is a gentleman that
had absent corpus callosum.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So he missed the connecting
tissue between his two brains.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
That actually allowed him
to read books with each eye

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.350 align:middle line:90%
independently on each page.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And he had this incredible
memory for that.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And so he was considered the
human encyclopedia at the time.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:84%
But he also over the course of
time developed some insights

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and made some connections, and
was quite a remarkable thinker.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Treffert
really mirrored many

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:84%
of the things he
recommended in the portrayal

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
that Dustin Hoffman had of the
savant on some other savants as

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.950 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Different skills and abilities
that they demonstrate too.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Dr.
Doll, not everybody

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:84%
who suffers brain trauma turns
out to be a savant, right?

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLL: That's correct.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.360 align:middle line:84%
We're finding that there are
certain areas of the brain.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And typically, there's one
area on the left side that sort

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
of functions as a governor or
a control over your right side

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:90%
of your brain.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Treffert would talk about
it as an injury that releases

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.010 align:middle line:90%
the tyrant of your left brain.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So you can access
your right brain.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be the most
consistent finding within

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Savant's.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Congenital savants are
born with differences.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes,
those skills do come

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:84%
from the wiring that
occurs that allows

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.397 align:middle line:84%
them access to the right
side of their brains.

00:28:16.397 --> 00:28:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much
of the brain have we

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:90%
learned about by this time?

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLL: We're still
in the infancy stage.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.580 align:middle line:84%
There are some amazing
technologies that we've really

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:90%
learned a lot.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:90%
We're starting to map networks.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And in some like diffuse
imaging technology,

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:84%
it's really fascinating because
as Jason talks about the lines,

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:84%
you actually see almost
these lines and patterns

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.100 align:middle line:84%
in brain architecture
about the networks that

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.770 align:middle line:90%
are connecting to each other.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elon Musk wants to put
a neuralink chip in our brains.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Will that help us or hurt us?

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLL: I think that
technology is something that we

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:90%
have to be very cautious about.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.660 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
something thoroughly

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:84%
before we start going
down those roads.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It certainly would be appealing
to try to interface more

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.700 align:middle line:90%
with computers.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
we even understand

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.690 align:middle line:84%
what we're capable of when
we're still discovering

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.900 align:middle line:84%
these amazing connections
and processes just

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:84%
through the accidental
injuries that occur.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we need an
injury or some situation

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:90%
in order to induce this?

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we do it without that?

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLL: There has been, as
Jason mentioned, some technology

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that pulses some
magnetic interference

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.510 align:middle line:84%
in different areas of
our brain, which allows

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:90%
us to access other areas.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to think
of that especially

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:90%
in our Western technology.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put
a helmet on instead

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:84%
of learning to meditate,
for example, or practice

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:46.750 align:middle line:90%
mindfulness.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:49.990 align:middle line:84%
We actually change our brain's
architecture when we meditate.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Six weeks of meditation
will actually

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:90%
change your hypothalamus.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have more
control than we think

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:84%
we do over accessing these
different skills and abilities.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It's through injury
that suddenly we

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.190 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, I have
access or sometimes

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.520 align:middle line:84%
disease process like
some forms of dementia.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But it is also possible
that through more

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:84%
intentional practice
and some techniques

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can learn that we
can access all of our brains.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you still
working with Jason?

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLL: Yes.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
We continue to be
in conversations.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:84%
He's hopefully coming up and
visiting our newest place,

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:84%
the Treffert Studios, so that
we can help him kind of put

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:84%
together a visual representation
of how he perceives the world.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, take a few
minutes and chat with Dr. Doll.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.057 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: How's it going?

00:30:36.057 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLL: Really good.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:37.640 align:middle line:90%
How are you been doing?

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Good.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.727 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward
to coming out there.

00:30:39.727 --> 00:30:43.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be making
some videos of how--

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:84%
what pi is describing
geometrically,

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to be helping
me do some other things that

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.258 align:middle line:84%
have to do with the
holographic universe principle.

00:30:51.258 --> 00:30:53.300 align:middle line:84%
It's been really wonderful
working with you guys.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.175 align:middle line:84%
You guys have changed
my life for the better.

00:30:55.175 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And granted me a lot of
understanding of what

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:84%
was going on, so that I didn't
feel quite so different, and so

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.322 align:middle line:90%
out of place in the world.

00:31:07.322 --> 00:31:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLL: It's a real
rare condition.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that while it's
a truly a gift to mathematics

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and the things that you're
able to do, the story that--

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and when asked like what is it
about Jason that's so amazing?

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I also think that part of the
story, Jason, where you really

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:84%
sought out those people
that harmed you and looked

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:90%
to reconcile.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just think your
kindness and genuine nature

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.720 align:middle line:90%
is also one of your superpowers.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: That was
one of the things that

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.200 align:middle line:84%
was really amazing, is one
of my attackers reached out

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.540 align:middle line:84%
to me about three
years ago and he

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:90%
said he was watching a video.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of the video, he

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
said the video was
talking about these two

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.308 align:middle line:90%
guys that attacked somebody.

00:31:45.308 --> 00:31:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said halfway
through the show,

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:90%
he realized he was the bad guy.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And he sent me a
text on Facebook

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and said I just want to
let you know I apologize.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:00.127 align:middle line:84%
And he now sits on a national
nonprofit for at-risk youth

00:32:00.127 --> 00:32:01.460 align:middle line:90%
helping them change their lives.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So he is-- it turned out
that in the long run,

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:84%
it turned out to be a
wonderful thing for me.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And in the long
run, it turned out

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.140 align:middle line:90%
it made his life better too.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
get the jacket back?

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.283 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Didn't
get the jacket back.

00:32:12.283 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But he did confirm that,
that was why they did it.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:84%
One of them said, Oh,
I like his jacket.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And the other guy said,
Oh, let's take it.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And they just-- they
had too much to drink.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.700 align:middle line:90%
And they were young.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And had some bad
life experiences

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.200 align:middle line:90%
that had just happened to them.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I look back
at it now, especially

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:36.342 align:middle line:84%
after seeing how he
changed over the years,

00:32:36.342 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I actually feel nothing
but compassion for him now.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:42.280 align:middle line:84%
The Treffert Center, how
has it changed your life?

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: It's changed
my life because it

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.340 align:middle line:84%
brought a lot more understanding
to what was going on.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:51.110 align:middle line:84%
It helped to relieve some of
the fear and also some of that

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.800 align:middle line:84%
worry that I had of what if
what if I'm the only one who

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:90%
sees this and it's not real?

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:84%
They helped with that,
and also going to school

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:84%
helped with that so that I
was able to write it properly

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:84%
so that we knew for sure
that what I was doing

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:84%
was correct, because I would
doubt myselves at time-- myself

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.790 align:middle line:84%
at times just thinking that
it was too good to be true.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It was too good to be
true, yet eventually

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:84%
was able to show that
what I was drawing

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.290 align:middle line:84%
was what I thought it was,
just a different way of looking

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:90%
at it.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Doll, thank you
for being on Beyond Belief.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLL: It's
absolutely my pleasure.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very
much for having me.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, Dr. Doll
is a fascinating guy.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Yeah, he's
a very nice person.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.550 align:middle line:90%
They've changed my life.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did you find them?

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Originally, I was
watching a television program,

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was about a guy that was
talking about seeing numbers.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first time I'd ever

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.545 align:middle line:84%
heard anybody describe numbers
in a way that was visual.

00:33:45.545 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
happening to you.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yes.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Treffert from
the Treffert Center who

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.580 align:middle line:84%
works with Dr. Doll
was on the show,

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and I wound up emailing
them, and that's

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:84%
how we came into
contact with each other.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating, it is.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:90%
What about the Doppler effect?

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:02.580 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Yeah, the
Doppler effect is a good way

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.070 align:middle line:84%
to describe relativity
so that everybody

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.340 align:middle line:84%
can understand what
relativity is describing,

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and why we all have
our own unique reality.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So you know how you
hear a car drive by you

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and it goes and
it changes pitch?

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So short wavelengths of
sound are a high pitch

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:84%
and long wavelengths of
sound are a low pitch.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
As the car is moving
towards me, those waves

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:84%
are squishing together
and getting closer.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And so you hear the
pitch getting higher,

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:32.040 align:middle line:84%
then it goes [VOCALIZES] and
now it's moving away from me

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and they stretch out
and they get longer

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the
pitch getting lower.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doppler
radar sort of thing.

00:34:36.112 --> 00:34:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: And so now we
add relativity to that

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and we say the car is
driving from me towards you.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, since it's
moving away from me,

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.070 align:middle line:84%
the waves are getting
longer for me.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.090 align:middle line:90%
So I hear a low pitch.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.628 align:middle line:84%
But relative to you,
it's moving towards you.

00:34:47.628 --> 00:34:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So the waves are compressing
and you hear a high pitch.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And you stop right
there and say,

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.370 align:middle line:84%
is the sound that
the car is making

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.960 align:middle line:90%
a low pitch or a high pitch?

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.260 align:middle line:84%
It's making both sounds
relative to who's looking at it.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you imagine we have
an infinite number of people

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.250 align:middle line:90%
all looking at that car.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're all moving
at different velocities.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Every single person will
measure a different wavelength

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and they'll all hear
a different sound,

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:84%
yet everybody's
version of a reality

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:middle line:84%
is correct, even though
they're all different.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.845 align:middle line:90%
And that applies to light--

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How can that be?

00:35:15.065 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: You
can take-- one way

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can test it
is like take two guys

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.990 align:middle line:84%
can go out with two cell phones
and have your buddy drive

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.397 align:middle line:84%
his car in between you
while you film them.

00:35:24.397 --> 00:35:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And then play them
next to each other.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And you'll hear the
high pitch on one,

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.425 align:middle line:90%
the low pitch on the other.

00:35:28.425 --> 00:35:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So where you are relative
to what you're observing

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.258 align:middle line:90%
defines what it is.

00:35:33.258 --> 00:35:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
just apply to sound.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.080 align:middle line:84%
That applies to time,
that applies to light.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Everything about something.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.810 align:middle line:90%
You can change how big it is.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Everything about it.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:84%
You can change by changing
your motion relative to it

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.555 align:middle line:90%
and to you, that is reality.

00:35:46.555 --> 00:35:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But to somebody else in
a different position,

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and a different velocity,
they have a slightly different

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:90%
picture.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:84%
But we all can agree
on reality around us

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.130 align:middle line:84%
because we're all moving
generally the same speed.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But when you start approaching
the speed of light,

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:90%
wild things happen.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you start having
vastly different experiences.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you understand any
of this prior to your injury?

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: I thought
that I literally

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.120 align:middle line:90%
would joke how math was stupid.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
when are you going

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.058 align:middle line:90%
to use that in the real world?

00:36:12.058 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking
that was so smart to say.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.515 align:middle line:84%
And now I look back
at it and I can't even

00:36:16.515 --> 00:36:17.640 align:middle line:90%
believe I thought that way.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Math is everything.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:24.000 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing that is not
described by mathematics.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you in the
real world all the time?

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Yeah, it depends on
what the real world is, right?

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I think about this over
and over like every person

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.200 align:middle line:84%
has their own individual
version of reality.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And I try to think
in different ways

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.930 align:middle line:84%
to help me understand some of
these principles differently.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Like I try to think in terms of
superposition or probability,

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:84%
where you try to imagine
going from point A

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to point B. What are all the
ways that I can go there?

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And what is the average
sum of all of those ways?

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And that describes what
actually happens in reality.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:84%
When it gets down into physics,
that's how they describe it.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:09.390 align:middle line:84%
We are the sum of
all possibilities.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of those
possibilities cancel out.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And the one that
doesn't cancel out

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.612 align:middle line:84%
is what happens almost
always in reality.

00:37:15.612 --> 00:37:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now how's
your health now?

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:17.940 align:middle line:90%
You look good.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Yeah,
I'm feeling better.

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.910 align:middle line:84%
I've actually-- when it
comes to like weight,

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:21.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling better.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:26.573 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to other
problems, they're pretty much

00:37:26.573 --> 00:37:27.990 align:middle line:84%
going to be there
for life when it

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.480 align:middle line:84%
comes to like muscle twitches
and headaches and things

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.280 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But I've learned to deal
with it better over time.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:90%
The OCD has gotten better.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I did this thing called
desensitization therapy.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I used to not be
able to open doors.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I would wait at
doors for somebody

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to open it because
I wouldn't touch it.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:37:43.665 --> 00:37:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Just because
you're suddenly aware--

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.460 align:middle line:84%
being aware of
everything visually,

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I would watch somebody watching
and then wipe their nose

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:90%
and then grab the door handle.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I would see somebody
else do something similar, then

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.470 align:middle line:84%
grab the door handle and I would
think I just don't want it--

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:84%
it would almost
feel hot and sticky

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.600 align:middle line:84%
just because I was so aware of
everything that was going on

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.200 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't notice before.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it bugged you?

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.027 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Oh, it was awful.

00:38:03.027 --> 00:38:04.470 align:middle line:90%
I would carry hand sanitizer.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.740 align:middle line:84%
When I went to school, I
would bleach off the tables.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:10.172 align:middle line:84%
I have a medical grade
UV light sanitizer--

00:38:10.172 --> 00:38:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
pre-COVID, weren't you?

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.990 align:middle line:90%
And this was pre-COVID.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Now people joke that I
was just ahead of COVID.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
ahead of your time.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Yeah.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Now everybody's starting
to feel something

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.410 align:middle line:90%
similar to what I felt.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.077 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got a
light bulb fixation.

00:38:21.077 --> 00:38:23.150 align:middle line:84%
If it's burned out, I
have to have it replaced.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Right.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And all those things are
different forms of compulsions

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.637 align:middle line:90%
that we all feel.

00:38:29.637 --> 00:38:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was just
getting to the point

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.960 align:middle line:84%
where I was a little bit
more in control of them

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.960 align:middle line:84%
instead of them being in control
of me, because a lot of times,

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I would feel something--
like I wanted

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:41.730 align:middle line:84%
to wash my hands constantly,
and I knew it was silly,

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:44.070 align:middle line:84%
but I would still feel
the compulsion to do it.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was
desensitization therapy,

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.710 align:middle line:84%
where like we would clean a
doorknob with a bleach wipe.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I would make
myself touch the doorknob

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and touch my face because
I know it's clean.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, it
only takes a few days.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So if there's anybody
that's suffering from OCD,

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:58.950 align:middle line:90%
try that therapy.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.260 align:middle line:84%
You'd be surprised how
much it can help you.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the Bekenstein?

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: So the Bekenstein
bound is the number of ways

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that our universe
can be reconfigured.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Imagine our universe,
and our universe

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.220 align:middle line:84%
is pixelated like a
television screen,

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.170 align:middle line:84%
only the pixels are
very microscopic.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And the Bekenstein bound
asks, how many ways can we

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:84%
rearrange the pixels
of our universe

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:25.530 align:middle line:84%
to create a new and unique film
or a new and unique timeline?

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And the number is 2 to the
10th to the 123rd power.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the number of
ways that our universe

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:84%
can be reconfigured to
make a new timeline.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.140 align:middle line:84%
But in that-- but if you
have that many big bangs,

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.030 align:middle line:84%
then the pattern
repeats, or if you go out

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that many observable sized
universes in our universe

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
now, if you just go out
forever, eventually,

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:50.040 align:middle line:84%
2 to the 10th power to 123rd
universe is away from us,

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.330 align:middle line:90%
the pattern will repeat also.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So the Bekenstein bound is
just describing all the ways

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.670 align:middle line:84%
that our universe
can be reconfigured

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.050 align:middle line:90%
to make a new and unique film.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a book
called "Struck by Genius."

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.585 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:40:01.585 --> 00:40:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Yeah, so
"Struck by Genius,"

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky enough to
meet Maureen Seaberg.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:10.890 align:middle line:84%
She-- we met when I went to get
these scans done in Finland.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And she writes books.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And she wound up
writing the book for me.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And she did a fantastic job.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was an option to be made
into a major motion picture.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
some people, Jason,

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.480 align:middle line:84%
who believe we live in
a holographic universe.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:28.170 align:middle line:84%
What's your take on that
mathematically speaking?

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: I believe we do
live in a holographic universe.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So the holographic
universe principle

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.270 align:middle line:84%
is describing how our
reality is a projection,

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:84%
like a hologram that
is projected onto what

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:90%
we call 4D flat spacetime.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's projected
from black holes.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But one of the problems
that we're having

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.860 align:middle line:90%
is, where are the black holes?

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think I have
a solution that

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:53.220 align:middle line:84%
may allow us to
understand where they are

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.390 align:middle line:90%
and why we don't see them.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're talking
like a savant now.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: Well,
it's basically just

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that black holes form
in between the picture

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:01.963 align:middle line:90%
frames of our universe.

00:41:01.963 --> 00:41:03.630 align:middle line:84%
If you think of our
universe progressing

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.480 align:middle line:84%
in time like a movie, in
between the picture frames when

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.430 align:middle line:84%
you can't observe any
particles, they all

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:09.840 align:middle line:90%
exist in superposition.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And wherever you have two
photons or the energy of two

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.710 align:middle line:84%
photons or more on one
pixel of our universe,

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:18.630 align:middle line:84%
it will by definition
collapse into

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.520 align:middle line:90%
a tiny microscopic black hole.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And that black hole will
evaporate due to something

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.140 align:middle line:90%
called Hawking radiation.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And that radiation
imparts a vector

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:84%
onto the pixel, which then
describes the probability

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.330 align:middle line:90%
of the wave function collapse.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:33.997 align:middle line:84%
And so the only thing
that I'm coming up

00:41:33.997 --> 00:41:36.860 align:middle line:84%
with that is potentially
new is the reason

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.990 align:middle line:84%
why we see the effects
of black holes,

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:42.410 align:middle line:84%
but we don't see them is
because they form and evaporate.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:84%
What we perceive as
reality is the evaporation

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.980 align:middle line:84%
of the black hole,
so that then reform

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.960 align:middle line:84%
again in between the
next picture frames.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you like
to be remembered, Jason?

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: I would
like to be remembered

00:41:55.850 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:84%
in terms of helping people to
understand or raise awareness

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that all of us think
we don't like math.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And I understand the
courses are difficult.

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And reading those books,
they can be monotonous.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it the right
way, even if you just

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.140 align:middle line:84%
want to understand it, if
you look at it geometrically,

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to tens of thousands
of people over the years.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And almost all of
them get nervous

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.165 align:middle line:84%
when we start
talking about math.

00:42:21.165 --> 00:42:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But once we spend
5 or 10 minutes,

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:25.340 align:middle line:84%
they're completely
engaged because everybody

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.663 align:middle line:84%
can understand it if it's
shown to them the proper way.

00:42:28.663 --> 00:42:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
would like to do

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.140 align:middle line:84%
is just show everybody
you can understand it.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.243 align:middle line:84%
It's just it needs to
be in a language, which

00:42:35.243 --> 00:42:37.160 align:middle line:84%
is visual, which is how
we all live our lives.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.835 align:middle line:84%
We don't live our
lives with equations.

00:42:38.835 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get ahold of you

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.033 align:middle line:90%
if they want to contact you?

00:42:42.033 --> 00:42:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: If people
want to contact me,

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.968 align:middle line:84%
one good way is on
Fine Art America.

00:42:45.968 --> 00:42:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of my
drawings on there.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.010 align:middle line:84%
People contact me
on email there,

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:51.770 align:middle line:84%
or find me on Twitter or
Facebook and friend me.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I have met so many
amazing people

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.130 align:middle line:90%
over the years from online.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.755 align:middle line:84%
So if you're watching,
feel free to contact me.

00:42:58.755 --> 00:43:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
turn the clock back,

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.670 align:middle line:84%
would you want this to
happen to you again?

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PADGETT: I would not
change this for the world.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.258 align:middle line:84%
It was in the long
run by far the best

00:43:07.258 --> 00:43:08.550 align:middle line:90%
thing that ever happened to me.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.037 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Absolutely.

00:43:10.037 --> 00:43:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I met my wife because of it.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.360 align:middle line:90%
My children exist.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.980 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't gotten mugged,
I wouldn't have met my wife.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.210 align:middle line:90%
My kids wouldn't be here.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have this
newfound love and fascination

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:84%
for the world that I
didn't have before.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.980 align:middle line:84%
My life has changed so
much, and so much of it now

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.802 align:middle line:84%
is for the better than that
the negatives are unimportant.

00:43:29.802 --> 00:43:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
found forgiveness.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Absolutely.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.492 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised, because for
years, I hated those guys.

00:43:35.492 --> 00:43:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I must have killed them
in my head a million times.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would blame you?

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Right.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.797 align:middle line:84%
It was like I had so
much anger and I've

00:43:40.797 --> 00:43:41.880 align:middle line:90%
gone through so much pain.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But when he contacted me,
it just like melted away.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.552 align:middle line:84%
I realized that he
had a rough life.

00:43:48.552 --> 00:43:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard about what
had happened to him right

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.040 align:middle line:84%
before that and that he
had turned his life around,

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and he turned his
life around not

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:56.085 align:middle line:90%
because he felt obligated to.

00:43:56.085 --> 00:43:57.960 align:middle line:84%
He turned his life around
before he found out

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.335 align:middle line:84%
anything that had
happened to me,

00:43:59.335 --> 00:44:01.410 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted to
be a better person.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.820 align:middle line:90%
And I can understand that.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.865 align:middle line:90%
I was a silly teenager.

00:44:05.865 --> 00:44:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember some of the
stupid things that I thought.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.027 align:middle line:90%
And he completely changed.

00:44:11.027 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Thank you.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a
fascinating individual.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: I enjoyed it.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I wish you all
the success in the world.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PADGETT: Thank you.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating person.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Would you want to go
through what he went through

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.060 align:middle line:90%
to become a savant?

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Most of us would say no.

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:27.690 align:middle line:90%
But look at the results.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
