>> George Noory: You
know we all dream,

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:39.027 align:middle line:84%
but not all of us
remember our dreams,

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.163 align:middle line:84%
and then what do
they really mean?

00:00:41.163 --> 00:00:43.563 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest
on "Beyond Belief"

00:00:43.563 --> 00:00:46.893 align:middle line:84%
today, Kelly Sullivan Walden,
she's a hypnotherapist,

00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:49.871 align:middle line:84%
noted author of a bestselling
book, I Had The Strangest Dream

00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:53.658 align:middle line:84%
and also It's All
In Your Dreams.

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:56.913 align:middle line:84%
Let's welcome to "Beyond
Belief," Kelly Sullivan Walden.

00:00:56.913 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Hey, welcome to the program.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.414 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:00.348 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you.

00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:01.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly Sullivan
Walden: So good.

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:02.533 align:middle line:90%
It's so great to see you, too.

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How did you
get involved in dreams?

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Ah, I'll
have to take you back all

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.124 align:middle line:84%
theway to when I
was a little girl.

00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:10.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Then
let's go way back.

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:11.526 align:middle line:90%
How old were you?

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:12.901 align:middle line:84%
>>Sullivan Walden:
The first time

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:16.829 align:middle line:84%
I remember remembering a
dream I was about four, maybe

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:17.899 align:middle line:90%
five years old.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.873 align:middle line:84%
I shared a bedroom
with my sister Shannon.

00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:21.623 align:middle line:84%
I have four sisters,
but my sister Shannon

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and I-- >> Noory: All
popped in there, huh?

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Yeah,
and my sister Shannon and I,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.784 align:middle line:84%
I'm close with all my sisters,
but my sister Shannon and I

00:01:28.784 --> 00:01:31.079 align:middle line:84%
are, like, kind of
psychic twins in a sense.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.547 align:middle line:90%
We read each other's mind.

00:01:32.547 --> 00:01:35.047 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of psychic
phenomena between the two

00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:38.817 align:middle line:84%
of us, and we would often
do what twins would often

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:41.035 align:middle line:84%
do, which is tandem
dreaming, so I'd

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:43.725 align:middle line:84%
share a dream in the morning,
and she'd say, "I was there,"

00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:45.392 align:middle line:84%
and then she would
finish describing it,

00:01:45.392 --> 00:01:49.196 align:middle line:84%
and we would often share
similar dreamscapes,

00:01:49.196 --> 00:01:51.065 align:middle line:84%
so that happened
a number of times

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:54.035 align:middle line:84%
so that kept us wanting
to remember dreams.

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:57.306 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't happen every night,
but it happened often enough

00:01:57.306 --> 00:01:58.473 align:middle line:90%
where it became like a game.

00:01:58.473 --> 00:02:00.909 align:middle line:84%
It became this fun
source of entertainment.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.344 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have all
the video games

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:03.912 align:middle line:90%
that kids have these days so.

00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:05.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Right, no we didn't
have any of those in those

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:05.247 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:02:05.247 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Right, so we
had to use our inner resources

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.285 align:middle line:90%
to keep us entertained.

00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:14.326 align:middle line:84%
I remember we were at a family
gathering up in Lake Tahoe

00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:15.868 align:middle line:84%
and there was some
older cousins that

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:18.994 align:middle line:84%
looked at my sister Shannon and
I just sitting on a bench kind

00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:21.524 align:middle line:84%
of not even talking, and they
said, "You two look so bored,"

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:22.597 align:middle line:90%
and I thought my God.

00:02:22.597 --> 00:02:24.132 align:middle line:90%
We are so not bored.

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:26.501 align:middle line:84%
We're having this whole
inner conversation

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:30.605 align:middle line:84%
about this vast inner
world that nobody can see,

00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:33.842 align:middle line:84%
but it's very real to us,
and we were never bored,

00:02:33.842 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:90%
so that began the journey.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I became a professional
several-- seventeen years ago

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.706 align:middle line:84%
with as a hypnotherapist
and started

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:45.287 align:middle line:84%
working with other people,
not just myself and my sister,

00:02:45.287 --> 00:02:47.606 align:middle line:84%
but other people
finding that dreams

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:52.194 align:middle line:84%
have a very real relevance
in our waking lives,

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:55.074 align:middle line:84%
and how sad that
most of the time

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:57.499 align:middle line:84%
they're disregarded as,
ah, it was just a dream.

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.724 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did you study dreams
like Sigmund Freud did where

00:03:00.724 --> 00:03:04.105 align:middle line:84%
you interpreted them that
they always meant something?

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:07.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: I believe
that every dream means

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.009 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.011 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some dreams
that are the bigger dreams,

00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:11.733 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
the smaller dreams,

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
in between dreams,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.537 align:middle line:84%
but I think there's no such
thing as a throw away dream,

00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:19.221 align:middle line:84%
even one that seems like oh,
well that's just so obvious.

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:21.318 align:middle line:84%
I was walking the dog
yesterday, and here I

00:03:21.318 --> 00:03:22.989 align:middle line:84%
was walking the
dog in the dream,

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.402 align:middle line:84%
but I think if we look at
our dreams through the lens

00:03:26.402 --> 00:03:29.809 align:middle line:84%
of how could this be
informing me about something

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:30.966 align:middle line:90%
important in my life?

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:33.168 align:middle line:84%
How could this be filling
in a missing piece,

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
or showing me what's
in my blind spot?

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.816 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the dreams
through that lens,

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:39.274 align:middle line:84%
then they'll
usually-- they'll tend

00:03:39.274 --> 00:03:41.476 align:middle line:84%
to reveal something
important, and I've

00:03:41.476 --> 00:03:44.856 align:middle line:84%
had so many experiences where
that's been the case that it's

00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:46.341 align:middle line:90%
undeniable from my perspective.

00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:48.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know,
on "Coast To- Coast,"

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.186 align:middle line:84%
my radio show we'll get a lot of
calls from people about dreams,

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:53.154 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of them
say you know what?

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:55.962 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm dreaming, but
I just don't remember

00:03:55.962 --> 00:03:57.592 align:middle line:90%
what I'm dreaming about.

00:03:57.592 --> 00:03:59.294 align:middle line:84%
Why did they lose
that recollection?

00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:00.629 align:middle line:90%
What happens to that?

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: It's-- well,
it's so easy to not remember

00:04:03.198 --> 00:04:07.035 align:middle line:84%
dreams, because if we look at
the levels of brain activity,

00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:11.345 align:middle line:84%
there's all the way from
gamma to beta, alpha, delta,

00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:14.529 align:middle line:84%
or theta, then delta
where when we're dreaming,

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:16.077 align:middle line:90%
we're in deep delta.

00:04:16.077 --> 00:04:19.407 align:middle line:84%
The moment we start
to wake up, we move up

00:04:19.407 --> 00:04:21.803 align:middle line:84%
the escalator of our
mind up to theta,

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:25.826 align:middle line:84%
and then if we jump out of
bed we're in alpha or beta,

00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:29.073 align:middle line:84%
but if you can wake up
slowly, that's the trick,

00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:31.796 align:middle line:84%
is to remain like to know,
okay I'm waking up here,

00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:34.362 align:middle line:84%
and to know that your
brain waves are starting

00:04:34.362 --> 00:04:37.666 align:middle line:84%
to change, but to keep in
your same sleep position

00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:41.102 align:middle line:84%
and you can make an intent to
remember your dreams so it's

00:04:41.102 --> 00:04:43.667 align:middle line:84%
like you're gently moving
up the escalator as opposed

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:45.925 align:middle line:84%
to "vroom," and
then you cut the cut

00:04:45.925 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
the cord in a sense, so
it's easy to remember dreams

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.556 align:middle line:90%
if you're in the habit of it,

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.817 align:middle line:84%
and if you wake up
slowly, but if you're

00:04:52.817 --> 00:04:55.275 align:middle line:84%
like the average person in the
western world that bolts out

00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:57.858 align:middle line:84%
of bed and runs off and
gets their cup of coffee

00:04:57.858 --> 00:04:59.541 align:middle line:84%
and their doing
their emails, there's

00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:02.579 align:middle line:84%
no way you're going to remember
your dreams unless it comes

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:05.459 align:middle line:84%
back to you, and then that's a
gift when it comes back to you

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:07.295 align:middle line:84%
in the shower or
when you're driving.

00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Right, it doesn't
happen that often like that.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: No, and it's
like having a winning lottery

00:05:10.365 --> 00:05:12.519 align:middle line:84%
ticket that we just
went, ah, who cares.

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why do dreams
seem so realistic?

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:17.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Because
on the level of dreams,

00:05:17.138 --> 00:05:20.012 align:middle line:84%
they absolutely have a
reality of their own.

00:05:20.012 --> 00:05:22.054 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's so many
indigenous cultures that

00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:25.589 align:middle line:84%
believe that the nighttime
dreams, the nocturnal dreams,

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:28.618 align:middle line:84%
those are-- that's real
life, and this dream,

00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:30.285 align:middle line:84%
that we're having
right now, by the way,

00:05:30.285 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:90%
we're dreaming this together.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.154 align:middle line:90%
We all are.

00:05:33.154 --> 00:05:33.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's not a nightmare.

00:05:33.788 --> 00:05:34.588 align:middle line:90%
It's a good dream.

00:05:34.588 --> 00:05:37.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: It's a good
dream, but this is a dream,

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:39.928 align:middle line:84%
but this would be less real than
those dreams that we have when

00:05:39.928 --> 00:05:43.325 align:middle line:84%
we're asleep, so they have
a relevance of their own,

00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and they seem real
because they actually are.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.422 align:middle line:84%
We're engaged completely just
because our physical body is

00:05:49.422 --> 00:05:51.595 align:middle line:84%
knocked out, thank
God, doesn't mean

00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.575 align:middle line:90%
that it's not absolutely real.

00:05:53.575 --> 00:05:57.337 align:middle line:84%
In fact, people like
Carl Jung and many others

00:05:57.337 --> 00:06:01.459 align:middle line:84%
have landscapes that they visit
regularly with people that they

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:04.419 align:middle line:84%
only know on the level of
dreams that are always there

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.188 align:middle line:84%
and have a very real history
where you can dialog with them,

00:06:07.188 --> 00:06:10.725 align:middle line:84%
and they'll tell you about
their family, their ancestors,

00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:13.428 align:middle line:84%
and yet they don't
exist on this side.

00:06:13.428 --> 00:06:18.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Where are dreams
developed in the brain or out

00:06:18.542 --> 00:06:20.353 align:middle line:90%
there somewhere in the universe?

00:06:20.353 --> 00:06:21.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Thank you.

00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:24.572 align:middle line:84%
I think the answer
is all of the above.

00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:29.164 align:middle line:84%
You can-- I've interviewed
many dream scientists that

00:06:29.164 --> 00:06:33.515 align:middle line:84%
look at dreams from
a brain perspective,

00:06:33.515 --> 00:06:35.465 align:middle line:84%
from a neurological
perspective, so you

00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:38.343 align:middle line:84%
can say that the limbic
brain when we're sleeping

00:06:38.343 --> 00:06:40.114 align:middle line:90%
is what does most of the firing.

00:06:40.114 --> 00:06:41.489 align:middle line:84%
For example, when
we go to sleep,

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:43.224 align:middle line:90%
our whole brain doesn't sleep.

00:06:43.224 --> 00:06:46.308 align:middle line:84%
It's just our prefrontal
cortex and our parietal cortex

00:06:46.308 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that goes to sleep, because
we need to, because all day

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.331 align:middle line:90%
long we're working so hard.

00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:54.369 align:middle line:84%
But our limbic brain, this is
our emotions, our associations,

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:56.504 align:middle line:84%
our out of the box
thinking brain,

00:06:56.504 --> 00:06:58.273 align:middle line:90%
wakes up when we're sleeping.

00:06:58.273 --> 00:07:03.211 align:middle line:84%
In fact, during our REM
cycle it's very active,

00:07:03.211 --> 00:07:06.319 align:middle line:84%
and so from a brain
perspective, there's

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.551 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of explanations for
why we dream and how we dream.

00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:12.629 align:middle line:84%
However, there's all
kinds of phenomena

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:16.424 align:middle line:84%
that happens that can't be
described just neurologically,

00:07:16.424 --> 00:07:20.395 align:middle line:84%
that is about where people
predict things that happen way

00:07:20.395 --> 00:07:23.131 align:middle line:84%
in the future, or they know
things that happened way

00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:25.975 align:middle line:84%
in the past beyond what they've
ever studied historically,

00:07:25.975 --> 00:07:27.517 align:middle line:84%
or they're connecting
with ancestors,

00:07:27.517 --> 00:07:30.686 align:middle line:84%
and I have the chills as
I say this, look close

00:07:30.686 --> 00:07:33.573 align:middle line:84%
up on the goosebumps,
ah, where they connect

00:07:33.573 --> 00:07:36.671 align:middle line:84%
with ancestors that they
didn't know they had,

00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:38.713 align:middle line:84%
or family members that
they didn't know they had.

00:07:38.713 --> 00:07:41.282 align:middle line:90%
And they connect with healing.

00:07:41.282 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's so many.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I write about
several people that

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.854 align:middle line:84%
have-- that had cancer, and they
were given a very short time

00:07:47.854 --> 00:07:50.677 align:middle line:84%
to live, a few months to live,
but because of a remembered

00:07:50.677 --> 00:07:53.394 align:middle line:84%
dream that came from God knows
where, not just their brain,

00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:55.296 align:middle line:84%
but from a higher
guide of spirit,

00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:58.208 align:middle line:84%
and because they paid
attention to that dream,

00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:00.732 align:middle line:84%
and then worked with
that dream, they're

00:08:00.732 --> 00:08:01.896 align:middle line:90%
alive today years later.

00:08:01.896 --> 00:08:03.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Isn't that amazing?

00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:03.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
It is incredible.

00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:04.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And that voice.

00:08:04.405 --> 00:08:05.405 align:middle line:90%
They tap into something.

00:08:05.405 --> 00:08:06.674 align:middle line:90%
There's a force out there.

00:08:06.674 --> 00:08:08.176 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: It's--

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:10.551 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're spiritual beings
having a human experience.

00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:13.481 align:middle line:84%
We all know that,
but we really are.

00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:15.583 align:middle line:90%
We're not just these bodies.

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:19.152 align:middle line:84%
We're not just these being that
have-- that check our emails

00:08:19.152 --> 00:08:20.955 align:middle line:90%
and do our things every day.

00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:23.660 align:middle line:90%
We're connected to infinity.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.493 align:middle line:84%
I told my niece that
once when she was five,

00:08:25.493 --> 00:08:27.896 align:middle line:90%
and she's like what's infinity?

00:08:27.896 --> 00:08:30.498 align:middle line:90%
I'm like that's everything.

00:08:30.498 --> 00:08:33.467 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, she went, "Ah," and
she literally fell on the floor

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:37.337 align:middle line:84%
and went, "That's a
lot," and so she got it.

00:08:37.337 --> 00:08:40.707 align:middle line:84%
But we're connected
to infinity, eternity.

00:08:40.707 --> 00:08:43.878 align:middle line:84%
I mean we are so where
do we put all of that?

00:08:43.878 --> 00:08:47.315 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't fit in our normal
waking lives for most of us,

00:08:47.315 --> 00:08:49.751 align:middle line:84%
except for you and your
guests and the people

00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:50.752 align:middle line:90%
that you connect with.

00:08:50.752 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But the average
person, they have--

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.166 align:middle line:84%
it has to go
somewhere so usually

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.849 align:middle line:84%
is relegated to
their realm of dreams

00:08:55.849 --> 00:08:56.891 align:middle line:90%
and then forgotten about.

00:08:56.891 --> 00:08:59.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why do we have so
many different kinds of dreams?

00:08:59.349 --> 00:09:01.529 align:middle line:84%
We have precognitive
dreams, lucid dreams.

00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:03.287 align:middle line:90%
We have nightmares.

00:09:03.287 --> 00:09:05.633 align:middle line:90%
We have bizarre dreams.

00:09:05.633 --> 00:09:09.938 align:middle line:84%
We have-- I had a pizza
last night type dreams.

00:09:09.938 --> 00:09:12.373 align:middle line:90%
Why does this happen to us?

00:09:12.373 --> 00:09:16.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Because
we're multi facetted,

00:09:16.076 --> 00:09:19.247 align:middle line:84%
complex humans, and I think
our dreams are so efficient,

00:09:19.247 --> 00:09:21.783 align:middle line:84%
because we can have a dream
that appears to be, what I call,

00:09:21.783 --> 00:09:24.385 align:middle line:84%
"A sleep working dream."
>> Noory: Now what is that?

00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:26.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Sleep
working is a phenomena that

00:09:26.593 --> 00:09:29.003 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people have in
the western world where

00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
they're working so much by day
where their work isn't just

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.738 align:middle line:90%
their work, it's their passion.

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:34.863 align:middle line:84%
It's what they do, so they
dream about it at night.

00:09:34.863 --> 00:09:37.575 align:middle line:84%
My husband is a
composer and a director,

00:09:37.575 --> 00:09:40.468 align:middle line:84%
and he'll be composing in his
sleep so he's sleep working.

00:09:40.468 --> 00:09:43.381 align:middle line:84%
He's working it, and so he'll
wake up in the morning and have

00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:45.506 align:middle line:84%
brilliant ideas that came
directly from his dreams,

00:09:45.506 --> 00:09:48.744 align:middle line:84%
and he'll be exhausted
because he wasn't-- >> Noory:

00:09:48.744 --> 00:09:49.544 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't stop.

00:09:49.544 --> 00:09:51.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: No, exactly.

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:53.715 align:middle line:84%
But with those dreams
we can be sleep working.

00:09:53.715 --> 00:09:55.629 align:middle line:84%
We could be solving
problems that

00:09:55.629 --> 00:09:59.654 align:middle line:84%
relate to our ordinary,
mundane, day in day out lives,

00:09:59.654 --> 00:10:03.558 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time we're
also receiving insight

00:10:03.558 --> 00:10:06.561 align:middle line:84%
at the same time within that
same dream kind of crystallized

00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:08.799 align:middle line:84%
within that same
dream, is insight

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:11.532 align:middle line:84%
that can connect us with a
missing piece of our soul.

00:10:11.532 --> 00:10:14.702 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans call
it "soul retrieval."

00:10:14.702 --> 00:10:17.038 align:middle line:84%
We can be having a
soul retrieval dream.

00:10:17.038 --> 00:10:20.499 align:middle line:84%
We can be connecting with our
larger spirit, and our spirit

00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:22.671 align:middle line:84%
guide, and we could
be healing people

00:10:22.671 --> 00:10:24.629 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
world that we've never

00:10:24.629 --> 00:10:26.648 align:middle line:84%
even met before, all
incased with the missing.

00:10:26.648 --> 00:10:29.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What about the kinds
of dreams where we're running

00:10:29.717 --> 00:10:32.453 align:middle line:84%
and running and running, and
we're not going anywhere,

00:10:32.453 --> 00:10:34.722 align:middle line:90%
it's like a tire on ice?

00:10:34.722 --> 00:10:39.427 align:middle line:84%
Or that dream where you fall,
and you don't hit the bottom,

00:10:39.427 --> 00:10:44.899 align:middle line:84%
and I always heard when I
was kid if you hit you die.

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:90%
What are these dreams?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Oh,
let's address that one.

00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:48.002 align:middle line:90%
That's an important one.

00:10:48.002 --> 00:10:50.508 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's on
one level, we could

00:10:50.508 --> 00:10:52.762 align:middle line:84%
say that it is done
unto you as you believe

00:10:52.762 --> 00:10:56.312 align:middle line:84%
so if a person-- there's so
many different mythologies

00:10:56.312 --> 00:10:58.479 align:middle line:84%
that different cultures
have about what dreams mean.

00:10:58.479 --> 00:11:00.508 align:middle line:84%
I just talked to
a cab driver when

00:11:00.508 --> 00:11:02.425 align:middle line:84%
I was in New York last
week who's from Russia,

00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:03.967 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "If
you dream of kissing

00:11:03.967 --> 00:11:06.111 align:middle line:84%
a girl that means
if you meet her

00:11:06.111 --> 00:11:08.356 align:middle line:84%
it will be a disastrous
relationship."

00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:09.691 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, "What?

00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:12.193 align:middle line:84%
In our culture, if you
dream of kissing somebody

00:11:12.193 --> 00:11:13.891 align:middle line:84%
you think ah, that's
going to-- it's

00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:16.597 align:middle line:84%
going to go well" so we
have so many mythologies.

00:11:16.597 --> 00:11:22.403 align:middle line:84%
To me, my personal mythology
is the universe is on our side,

00:11:22.403 --> 00:11:26.541 align:middle line:84%
and that our dreams come to
us in the service of health,

00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:28.377 align:middle line:84%
healing and wholeness,
so I believe

00:11:28.377 --> 00:11:31.956 align:middle line:84%
all of the dreams, even the
scary ones, are good dreams,

00:11:31.956 --> 00:11:33.081 align:middle line:90%
are helping us in some way.

00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:35.694 align:middle line:84%
So a falling dream, for
example, some-- many people

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:37.652 align:middle line:84%
in this western world
would say a falling dream

00:11:37.652 --> 00:11:41.923 align:middle line:84%
means that you're out of control
in some part of your life.

00:11:41.923 --> 00:11:42.957 align:middle line:90%
You're overwhelmed.

00:11:42.957 --> 00:11:44.659 align:middle line:84%
You've got too
much on your plate.

00:11:44.659 --> 00:11:47.028 align:middle line:84%
You're not in control
of your environment.

00:11:47.028 --> 00:11:49.897 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another dream--
there's a dream tribe called,

00:11:49.897 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:84%
"The Senoi" from the
highlands of Malaysia,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.936 align:middle line:84%
and I love their interpretation
of falling dreams.

00:11:54.936 --> 00:11:56.404 align:middle line:90%
You're going to dig this.

00:11:56.404 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:84%
They believe that
falling dreams mean

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that there are falling
spirits whose job it

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.114 align:middle line:84%
is to help you in the dream
time to drop into your depth.

00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:07.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And catch you.

00:12:07.442 --> 00:12:09.984 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: And or you
are meant to learn how to fall

00:12:09.984 --> 00:12:11.224 align:middle line:90%
well so if you land--

00:12:11.224 --> 00:12:12.655 align:middle line:90%
I told my sister Shannon this.

00:12:12.655 --> 00:12:14.822 align:middle line:84%
She's the one that I have
the dream connection with,

00:12:14.822 --> 00:12:16.489 align:middle line:84%
because she had a lot
of falling dreams.

00:12:16.489 --> 00:12:18.994 align:middle line:84%
I said practice falling well,
and she said, "Oh my God,

00:12:18.994 --> 00:12:19.794 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:12:19.794 --> 00:12:21.834 align:middle line:90%
I did the dismount like a--

00:12:21.834 --> 00:12:22.949 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what.

00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:24.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Hit the
ground and keep running.

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:26.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Hit
the ground and keep running

00:12:26.823 --> 00:12:29.115 align:middle line:84%
or practice imagine that
you're landing on soft clouds,

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.131 align:middle line:84%
or you're landing
on a trampoline,

00:12:31.131 --> 00:12:34.091 align:middle line:84%
but practice landing, and
know that on some level,

00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:36.699 align:middle line:84%
if you believe this, you're
dropping into your depth;

00:12:36.699 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:84%
most of us kind of
live superficially.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.328 align:middle line:84%
We are our resume
kind of a thing,

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:43.183 align:middle line:84%
but we are so much
more than that,

00:12:43.183 --> 00:12:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's contained within
our depth, and the heights,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.133 align:middle line:84%
but practice falling
well so we can

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:53.012 align:middle line:84%
feel more grounded and connected
to Gaia while we're here.

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:54.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, like
our radio show Kelly,

00:12:54.762 --> 00:12:56.942 align:middle line:84%
we do take some phone calls
here on "Beyond Belief,"

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:59.967 align:middle line:84%
so let's go to one
of our viewers.

00:12:59.967 --> 00:13:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Great.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, Kelly, it's
John from Sedona.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.324 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering is it
possible for people

00:13:04.324 --> 00:13:07.735 align:middle line:84%
to die in their sleep
while they're dreaming?

00:13:07.735 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now that's an
interesting question,

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.746 align:middle line:84%
something that I've
always wondered about.

00:13:11.746 --> 00:13:14.615 align:middle line:84%
If somebody dies, and this
is, you know so and so died.

00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:17.518 align:middle line:84%
They died peacefully
in their sleep.

00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:21.182 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if it
was the dream that

00:13:21.182 --> 00:13:22.749 align:middle line:90%
scared them to death.

00:13:22.749 --> 00:13:23.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Well.

00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:25.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: How do we know?

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:27.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Right, or
that they went out peacefully

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:28.059 align:middle line:90%
in their dream.

00:13:28.059 --> 00:13:30.198 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
know, and it does happen.

00:13:30.198 --> 00:13:32.033 align:middle line:90%
People will have-- we, you know.

00:13:32.033 --> 00:13:33.895 align:middle line:84%
When we die our
heart stops beating

00:13:33.895 --> 00:13:35.603 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes that
can happen in a dream.

00:13:35.603 --> 00:13:38.274 align:middle line:84%
We can have a terrifying
dream that does cause

00:13:38.274 --> 00:13:39.841 align:middle line:90%
our hearts to stop in some way.

00:13:39.841 --> 00:13:40.842 align:middle line:90%
That does happen.

00:13:40.842 --> 00:13:43.054 align:middle line:84%
Although, and this
is another story.

00:13:43.054 --> 00:13:44.512 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I think
it happens a lot.

00:13:44.512 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
It probably does,

00:13:46.614 --> 00:13:48.071 align:middle line:84%
and that would probably be a
preferable way to go that you

00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:48.871 align:middle line:90%
die in your sleep.

00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:52.086 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's--
I'd prefer to go.

00:13:52.086 --> 00:13:53.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's kind of lonely.

00:13:53.497 --> 00:13:55.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
Unless you're sleeping.

00:13:55.289 --> 00:13:59.071 align:middle line:84%
Unless-- >> Noory: But, you
know at the same time I've

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:00.695 align:middle line:90%
always wondered about that.

00:14:00.695 --> 00:14:02.847 align:middle line:84%
If you die in your
sleep, you know,

00:14:02.847 --> 00:14:07.185 align:middle line:84%
other than moving on to
the next level, that's it,

00:14:07.185 --> 00:14:09.203 align:middle line:90%
peaceful, no pain, quick.

00:14:09.203 --> 00:14:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I kind of feel sorry for the
people who find you, you know.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Ah,
well, yeah, that's true.

00:14:15.543 --> 00:14:16.463 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:14:16.463 --> 00:14:17.921 align:middle line:84%
Reverend Michael
Beckwith, whom I'm

00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:20.379 align:middle line:84%
sure you are familiar with from
The Agape Spiritual Center,

00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:22.249 align:middle line:84%
I write about his
dream in here, and he

00:14:22.249 --> 00:14:24.819 align:middle line:90%
had a dream in which he had--

00:14:24.819 --> 00:14:27.688 align:middle line:84%
It was a recurring dream where
there were people chasing him

00:14:27.688 --> 00:14:30.791 align:middle line:84%
with knives, and every night
he was able to outrun them,

00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:32.793 align:middle line:84%
wake up before they
caught up to him.

00:14:32.793 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
However, after months of this,
they finally caught up to him,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.833 align:middle line:90%
and he got stabbed in the heart.

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: In the dream?

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
In the dream,

00:14:42.035 --> 00:14:43.237 align:middle line:90%
and he died in the dream.

00:14:43.237 --> 00:14:44.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: All right.

00:14:44.705 --> 00:14:46.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
And then he floated up,

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:50.711 align:middle line:84%
and he went up to a place
that he called "love beauty."

00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:56.684 align:middle line:84%
Inexplicably beautiful light
love, and it was so gorgeous,

00:14:56.684 --> 00:14:58.774 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "Wow, how
come I was resisting this

00:14:58.774 --> 00:15:00.121 align:middle line:90%
all this time?"

00:15:00.121 --> 00:15:02.823 align:middle line:84%
He woke up from that
dream in his waking life,

00:15:02.823 --> 00:15:05.126 align:middle line:90%
and his entire life changed.

00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:84%
He went from being on track
to become a doctor to starting

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.372 align:middle line:84%
to study metaphysical phenomena,
and that lead to him eventually

00:15:13.372 --> 00:15:15.803 align:middle line:84%
a couple years later starting
Agape Spiritual Center which

00:15:15.803 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
is one of the biggest
spiritual centers in America.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, why though
were these people chasing him?

00:15:20.875 --> 00:15:25.246 align:middle line:84%
What was happening in his
real life for that to occur?

00:15:25.246 --> 00:15:27.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: He
and I talked about this,

00:15:27.281 --> 00:15:28.749 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
I believe as well.

00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:31.852 align:middle line:84%
Those people that are
chasing us, we could look--

00:15:31.852 --> 00:15:34.021 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many
ways to look at it.

00:15:34.021 --> 00:15:37.358 align:middle line:84%
This is my personal
mythology, and he shares this.

00:15:37.358 --> 00:15:39.539 align:middle line:84%
That everyone in the dream,
even if they look scary,

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.206 align:middle line:84%
even if they look
horrific, even if they

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.299 align:middle line:84%
look like they're
coming to hurt us,

00:15:43.299 --> 00:15:45.700 align:middle line:90%
they're an aspect of ourselves.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.202 align:middle line:84%
They're an aspect of our
larger spiritual body,

00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:50.974 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming to
help us end a pattern,

00:15:50.974 --> 00:15:55.676 align:middle line:84%
so they're allies in disguise,
even though they look scary.

00:15:55.676 --> 00:15:58.062 align:middle line:84%
They look like they want to
kill me, but death in a dream

00:15:58.062 --> 00:16:02.817 align:middle line:84%
isn't the same as death in
this three dimensional world.

00:16:02.817 --> 00:16:05.596 align:middle line:84%
Death in a dream
represents an ending

00:16:05.596 --> 00:16:07.719 align:middle line:84%
of a chapter which
means the beginning

00:16:07.719 --> 00:16:08.889 align:middle line:90%
of a whole new chapter.

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:10.628 align:middle line:90%
So it's-- they're allies.

00:16:10.628 --> 00:16:12.628 align:middle line:84%
Often in our dreams, if
we can stop and remember

00:16:12.628 --> 00:16:14.829 align:middle line:84%
let me turn and face the
person who is chasing me,

00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:18.199 align:middle line:84%
and ask them why
are you chasing me.

00:16:18.199 --> 00:16:21.542 align:middle line:84%
And if you can, say,
"What kind of gift

00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:90%
are you trying to give me?"

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.672 align:middle line:84%
Then they might not
have to kill you.

00:16:24.672 --> 00:16:28.075 align:middle line:84%
They'll just go, oh,
well here, and bye bye.

00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is that a lucid dream
where you begin to control

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:31.812 align:middle line:90%
your outcome?

00:16:31.812 --> 00:16:34.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Yeah, it
takes a level of lucidity,

00:16:34.682 --> 00:16:37.617 align:middle line:84%
and that's a skill that most
people don't have or most

00:16:37.617 --> 00:16:39.594 align:middle line:84%
people don't want to
do the work to develop,

00:16:39.594 --> 00:16:41.637 align:middle line:84%
because that's a-- it takes
a lot of practice for most

00:16:41.637 --> 00:16:42.437 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:45.793 align:middle line:84%
There's some that just kind
of fall into it naturally.

00:16:45.793 --> 00:16:47.261 align:middle line:90%
I hate them.

00:16:47.261 --> 00:16:48.656 align:middle line:90%
Just kidding, don't hate them.

00:16:48.656 --> 00:16:50.538 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
have lucid dreaming,

00:16:50.538 --> 00:16:52.955 align:middle line:84%
and you wake up from a scary
dream-- this is actually

00:16:52.955 --> 00:16:55.830 align:middle line:84%
my area of specialty, I
get so excited about this.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.705 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You get excited
about scary dreams?

00:16:57.705 --> 00:16:58.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: I do.

00:16:58.973 --> 00:16:59.275 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:16:59.275 --> 00:17:01.358 align:middle line:84%
As a therapist, this is
why people come to see me.

00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:02.376 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:03.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Most of
their happy dreams they keep

00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:03.544 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:04.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh yeah.

00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: But they
call me when they're like--

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's the scary ones
that screw them up, right?

00:17:07.114 --> 00:17:08.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
Right, well, yeah,

00:17:08.716 --> 00:17:10.017 align:middle line:90%
but I see these scary dreams.

00:17:10.017 --> 00:17:15.155 align:middle line:84%
A nightmare is an unfinished
dream, so I'm the finisher.

00:17:15.155 --> 00:17:17.635 align:middle line:84%
I help them practice
how they would finish

00:17:17.635 --> 00:17:19.975 align:middle line:84%
their dream in
their waking state

00:17:19.975 --> 00:17:22.448 align:middle line:84%
as they are simultaneously
remembering what happened

00:17:22.448 --> 00:17:24.573 align:middle line:84%
in their dream, they're
kind of in a bridged state,

00:17:24.573 --> 00:17:26.967 align:middle line:84%
because they're here,
but they're also there.

00:17:26.967 --> 00:17:30.137 align:middle line:84%
I say, "You're the
director of your dream,

00:17:30.137 --> 00:17:32.006 align:middle line:90%
so you put an ending on it.

00:17:32.006 --> 00:17:34.008 align:middle line:90%
You re-script it.

00:17:34.008 --> 00:17:34.875 align:middle line:90%
You're the writer.

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:36.177 align:middle line:90%
You're the director.

00:17:36.177 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:84%
You're the star
of your own movie.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like the way
it's going, change it,

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.406 align:middle line:84%
and P.S., once you do this
enough in your-- with regards

00:17:46.406 --> 00:17:47.966 align:middle line:84%
to your nighttime
dreams, you start

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:51.759 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see the through
line about how that works

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:53.818 align:middle line:84%
in your waking life
as well, and that's

00:17:53.818 --> 00:17:55.463 align:middle line:90%
where it gets really juicy.

00:17:55.463 --> 00:17:58.165 align:middle line:84%
That's called "lucid living." >>
Noory: Oh, we'll get into that.

00:17:58.165 --> 00:18:02.411 align:middle line:84%
They say we dream all the
time, but we don't remember

00:18:02.411 --> 00:18:04.138 align:middle line:90%
them all the time; why is it?

00:18:04.138 --> 00:18:06.714 align:middle line:84%
Why does the brain
not absorb that dream

00:18:06.714 --> 00:18:08.008 align:middle line:90%
and carry it through?

00:18:08.008 --> 00:18:10.282 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: I
think the brain absorbs it.

00:18:10.282 --> 00:18:11.282 align:middle line:90%
I think our physiology--

00:18:11.282 --> 00:18:14.046 align:middle line:84%
I think we do absorb it, but
our conscious mind-- >> Noory:

00:18:14.046 --> 00:18:15.015 align:middle line:90%
We're blocking?

00:18:15.015 --> 00:18:17.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Our
conscious mind doesn't get it,

00:18:17.265 --> 00:18:19.693 align:middle line:84%
partly because as I said
before, the different wave,

00:18:19.693 --> 00:18:22.022 align:middle line:84%
brain waves, switch
when we wake up.

00:18:22.022 --> 00:18:24.876 align:middle line:84%
Also, as I said before,
when we go to sleep,

00:18:24.876 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:84%
our prefrontal cortex,
that's our-- that's

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.351 align:middle line:84%
the part of the
brain that controls

00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:32.433 align:middle line:84%
our logic, our reasoning,
our ego, are all,

00:18:32.433 --> 00:18:34.168 align:middle line:84%
this is all the stuff
I have to do today.

00:18:34.168 --> 00:18:36.203 align:middle line:84%
That part of the
brain goes to sleep

00:18:36.203 --> 00:18:39.683 align:middle line:84%
so when we're asleep it's
our limbic brain that's awake

00:18:39.683 --> 00:18:41.105 align:middle line:84%
doing all the
dreaming, and that's

00:18:41.105 --> 00:18:43.443 align:middle line:84%
why we can jump from place
to place, because logic isn't

00:18:43.443 --> 00:18:46.856 align:middle line:84%
running the show, but
the moment we wake up,

00:18:46.856 --> 00:18:50.479 align:middle line:84%
our brain switches so our
prefrontal cortex wakes

00:18:50.479 --> 00:18:52.898 align:middle line:84%
up and says, ta da,
I'm in charge now.

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.898 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put everything
in sequential order,

00:18:54.898 --> 00:18:56.491 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
figure it all out,

00:18:56.491 --> 00:18:58.701 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't-- it's almost
like they're two parts

00:18:58.701 --> 00:19:01.951 align:middle line:84%
of our brain that don't
communicate with each other

00:19:01.951 --> 00:19:05.204 align:middle line:84%
unless we practice building
the bridge between these two

00:19:05.204 --> 00:19:08.369 align:middle line:84%
aspects then we can have
a whole-brain experience.

00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:09.795 align:middle line:84%
But on one level
I hope that makes

00:19:09.795 --> 00:19:12.379 align:middle line:84%
sense why we don't remember
it so easily unless we

00:19:12.379 --> 00:19:14.018 align:middle line:90%
put some effort into it.

00:19:14.018 --> 00:19:15.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: One of
your best sellers,

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:18.145 align:middle line:84%
I Had the Strangest Dream,
what does that title mean?

00:19:18.145 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: This is what
most people say when they wake

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.983 align:middle line:84%
up in the morning, and
they do remember a dream.

00:19:22.983 --> 00:19:26.387 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it so many times,
and I've said it myself,

00:19:26.387 --> 00:19:28.889 align:middle line:84%
even though I say there's--
all of our dreams,

00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:30.991 align:middle line:84%
if they're not strange
there's something wrong,

00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:33.864 align:middle line:84%
but it's just a common
expression if you do remember

00:19:33.864 --> 00:19:36.397 align:middle line:84%
a dream, it was strange,
and it was supposed to be.

00:19:36.397 --> 00:19:38.305 align:middle line:84%
It's only strange
actually when you're

00:19:38.305 --> 00:19:41.035 align:middle line:84%
looking at it through the
filter of our logical mind.

00:19:41.035 --> 00:19:43.871 align:middle line:84%
But when you're looking
at it through the realm,

00:19:43.871 --> 00:19:47.007 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of our dreaming
mind, it makes perfect sense.

00:19:47.007 --> 00:19:48.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I had a strange
one a few months ago.

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:90%
This was weird, weird, weird.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
Oh, do share, do share.

00:19:52.646 --> 00:19:55.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I'm in my
house in my dream,

00:19:55.115 --> 00:20:00.246 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden people I
don't know start showing up.

00:20:00.246 --> 00:20:01.288 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Okay.

00:20:01.288 --> 00:20:02.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they
knock on the door,

00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:04.158 align:middle line:84%
and they walk in,
and one becomes two.

00:20:04.158 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Two becomes three.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.288 align:middle line:84%
Three becomes four,
and all these people

00:20:08.288 --> 00:20:14.001 align:middle line:84%
are coming in that I don't know,
and I'm saying well, you know.

00:20:14.001 --> 00:20:16.278 align:middle line:84%
I hope you had a good
time, but [brief laughter]

00:20:16.278 --> 00:20:20.341 align:middle line:84%
you all have to leave now,
but they wouldn't leave.

00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:22.076 align:middle line:90%
More people kept coming.

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:24.678 align:middle line:84%
I called the police,
I said, look,

00:20:24.678 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I've got a house full
of strange people.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.416 align:middle line:84%
They're not leaving,
and you know.

00:20:29.416 --> 00:20:31.151 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of weird
because you know,

00:20:31.151 --> 00:20:34.154 align:middle line:84%
the normal me would
get pretty aggressive

00:20:34.154 --> 00:20:36.624 align:middle line:90%
and say, get out of here.

00:20:36.624 --> 00:20:38.058 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Right.

00:20:38.058 --> 00:20:40.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But, you know I
was being docile in my dream,

00:20:40.361 --> 00:20:42.491 align:middle line:84%
just simply saying,
nobody's leaving,

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:47.958 align:middle line:84%
and they kept coming and coming,
and then I woke up and it was

00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
the-- it was so strange because
I was really upset that they

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.102 align:middle line:84%
kept coming and
they wouldn't leave.

00:20:56.102 --> 00:20:59.377 align:middle line:84%
Who cares, first of all,
but in my dream state

00:20:59.377 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%
it was like the biggest
issue of my life.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Wow.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What
the heck was that?

00:21:04.318 --> 00:21:05.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Well,
first let me ask you were

00:21:05.708 --> 00:21:08.088 align:middle line:84%
the people-- was there a
general tone that these people--

00:21:08.088 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: No, there were
all kinds of people.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: -- or were
they just like Disneyland,

00:21:10.457 --> 00:21:11.781 align:middle line:84%
like puff moments of
like-- >> Noory: All kinds,

00:21:11.781 --> 00:21:12.126 align:middle line:90%
men and women.

00:21:12.126 --> 00:21:13.193 align:middle line:90%
They just kept coming in.

00:21:13.193 --> 00:21:14.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Okay.

00:21:14.528 --> 00:21:16.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Maybe they were like
my listeners to my radio show.

00:21:16.463 --> 00:21:17.263 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:17.263 --> 00:21:18.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Okay.

00:21:18.332 --> 00:21:20.582 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a few different
ways to look at a dream.

00:21:20.582 --> 00:21:23.145 align:middle line:84%
I always like to say before
I give my opinion, if it were

00:21:23.145 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
my dream, I-- so that I'm not
taking any power away from you

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.068 align:middle line:90%
to you have your own ah ha.

00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:29.443 align:middle line:84%
If it were my dream, I'd look
at it from one perspective.

00:21:29.443 --> 00:21:31.219 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone
from one perspective

00:21:31.219 --> 00:21:36.550 align:middle line:84%
is an aspect of ourselves in
the dream, so I would say my--

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.219 align:middle line:84%
and a house represents the
container of our lives.

00:21:39.219 --> 00:21:41.522 align:middle line:90%
It can represent our body.

00:21:41.522 --> 00:21:43.462 align:middle line:84%
It can represent our
psyche, the-- >> Noory:

00:21:43.462 --> 00:21:44.024 align:middle line:90%
It's our privacy.

00:21:44.024 --> 00:21:45.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
It's our privacy.

00:21:45.566 --> 00:21:48.873 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, it's our container so
having a whole bunch of people

00:21:48.873 --> 00:21:52.626 align:middle line:84%
come into my house, I would
say that on some level

00:21:52.626 --> 00:21:55.172 align:middle line:84%
I've maybe unconsciously
invited them in

00:21:55.172 --> 00:21:58.339 align:middle line:84%
because they represent
different aspects of myself.

00:21:58.339 --> 00:22:00.007 align:middle line:84%
If we have a dream
that we're at a party

00:22:00.007 --> 00:22:02.401 align:middle line:84%
or in a big public
setting, then it usually

00:22:02.401 --> 00:22:05.353 align:middle line:84%
represents that we're connecting
with all the many people that

00:22:05.353 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:90%
live in here.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.947 align:middle line:84%
Often, I mean, there's
thousands of them

00:22:07.947 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that we've got so many
sub personalities,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.252 align:middle line:84%
not like Cybil's
split personalities,

00:22:12.252 --> 00:22:14.655 align:middle line:90%
but sub personalities.

00:22:14.655 --> 00:22:17.655 align:middle line:84%
Men, women, children,
and they all

00:22:17.655 --> 00:22:21.723 align:middle line:84%
represent aspects of our own
power, of our own psyche,

00:22:21.723 --> 00:22:23.263 align:middle line:90%
of our own genius.

00:22:23.263 --> 00:22:26.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, why did it upset
me so much that they would not

00:22:26.092 --> 00:22:26.333 align:middle line:90%
leave?

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:27.034 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: It
feels like sometimes--

00:22:27.034 --> 00:22:28.569 align:middle line:84%
I mean that was-- >>
Noory: That was my issue.

00:22:28.569 --> 00:22:29.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Right.

00:22:29.403 --> 00:22:30.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They wouldn't leave.

00:22:30.738 --> 00:22:34.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: On one level
I think we can all say we want

00:22:34.141 --> 00:22:37.048 align:middle line:84%
to have-- we want more access
to all of our blind spots,

00:22:37.048 --> 00:22:37.947 align:middle line:90%
to all of our selves.

00:22:37.947 --> 00:22:39.405 align:middle line:84%
We want to see
everything, and then

00:22:39.405 --> 00:22:41.954 align:middle line:84%
when it's done unto us
as we've been asking

00:22:41.954 --> 00:22:44.418 align:middle line:90%
we say, "Ah, that's too much."

00:22:44.418 --> 00:22:46.453 align:middle line:84%
Often they say be
careful what you ask for.

00:22:46.453 --> 00:22:48.462 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on your show
you're constantly

00:22:48.462 --> 00:22:51.135 align:middle line:84%
bringing in people
that are representing

00:22:51.135 --> 00:22:54.161 align:middle line:84%
different aspects of
psychic phenomena,

00:22:54.161 --> 00:22:58.832 align:middle line:84%
and in the-- the flood gates
are open to beings everywhere

00:22:58.832 --> 00:23:04.422 align:middle line:84%
so on some level, you're the
host to all of this wisdom, all

00:23:04.422 --> 00:23:09.544 align:middle line:84%
of this genius, and sometimes
it might be a bit, even to you,

00:23:09.544 --> 00:23:10.344 align:middle line:90%
overwhelming.

00:23:10.344 --> 00:23:12.381 align:middle line:84%
I would-- on some level
I would say, you know.

00:23:12.381 --> 00:23:14.381 align:middle line:84%
It could be we could look
at it very practically

00:23:14.381 --> 00:23:16.694 align:middle line:84%
and say a lot of
people love you.

00:23:16.694 --> 00:23:18.652 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people would
love to be in your house.

00:23:18.652 --> 00:23:21.897 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people would love to
be invited to a George Noory

00:23:21.897 --> 00:23:24.166 align:middle line:84%
party; I would so
there's-- >> Noory:

00:23:24.166 --> 00:23:25.793 align:middle line:84%
I don't have George
Noory parties.

00:23:25.793 --> 00:23:28.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Not yet,
maybe tonight on the dream

00:23:28.219 --> 00:23:29.363 align:middle line:90%
level, and I'm coming.

00:23:29.363 --> 00:23:32.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's take another
phone call for you, for Kelly.

00:23:32.366 --> 00:23:33.534 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:23:33.534 --> 00:23:34.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, it's Monica.

00:23:34.868 --> 00:23:37.838 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if a person
can make themselves dream?

00:23:37.838 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Can you
make yourself dream?

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.608 align:middle line:90%
Can you create the dream?

00:23:41.608 --> 00:23:44.254 align:middle line:84%
Can you go to bed
and say I'm going

00:23:44.254 --> 00:23:47.414 align:middle line:84%
to dream about this
cruise I want to take,

00:23:47.414 --> 00:23:48.882 align:middle line:90%
and it becomes that?

00:23:48.882 --> 00:23:49.683 align:middle line:90%
Can you do it?

00:23:49.683 --> 00:23:50.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Sure, sure.

00:23:50.617 --> 00:23:52.286 align:middle line:84%
On some level yes,
on some level no.

00:23:52.286 --> 00:23:54.596 align:middle line:84%
We're going to dream
no matter what,

00:23:54.596 --> 00:23:57.256 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to dream
about the things that

00:23:57.256 --> 00:23:58.258 align:middle line:90%
are important to us.

00:23:58.258 --> 00:24:00.463 align:middle line:84%
We're going to dream naturally
about the things that

00:24:00.463 --> 00:24:02.296 align:middle line:84%
are unfinished business
in our waking lives,

00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:04.398 align:middle line:84%
and about our desires
for the future,

00:24:04.398 --> 00:24:06.433 align:middle line:84%
so those things
are already there.

00:24:06.433 --> 00:24:11.138 align:middle line:84%
However, there's such a thing
called "Dream Incubation,"

00:24:11.138 --> 00:24:13.807 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that
people are very interested in,

00:24:13.807 --> 00:24:15.649 align:middle line:84%
especially since the
movie, "The Secret"

00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:18.045 align:middle line:84%
came out years ago,
people want to manifest

00:24:18.045 --> 00:24:19.513 align:middle line:90%
the life of their dreams.

00:24:19.513 --> 00:24:20.481 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I do that.

00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:21.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:22.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's easy.

00:24:22.049 --> 00:24:23.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
Do you dream about--

00:24:23.383 --> 00:24:24.551 align:middle line:84%
you focus on something
you want to dream about?

00:24:24.551 --> 00:24:26.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And it
happens all the time.

00:24:26.186 --> 00:24:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Okay.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.654 align:middle line:90%
Can you give us an example?

00:24:27.654 --> 00:24:28.654 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Perhaps later.

00:24:28.654 --> 00:24:29.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Okay.

00:24:29.723 --> 00:24:31.692 align:middle line:84%
So with regards to
"Dream Incubation"

00:24:31.692 --> 00:24:34.294 align:middle line:84%
as if you didn't know,
but you already know,

00:24:34.294 --> 00:24:38.975 align:middle line:84%
you can meditate before you
go to sleep very briefly or as

00:24:38.975 --> 00:24:41.639 align:middle line:84%
elaborately as you'd
like, but focus on-- so

00:24:41.639 --> 00:24:43.206 align:middle line:84%
if you want to take
a cruise, and you

00:24:43.206 --> 00:24:45.206 align:middle line:84%
don't know how you're
going to make that happen.

00:24:45.206 --> 00:24:47.574 align:middle line:90%
You think about the cruise.

00:24:47.574 --> 00:24:50.054 align:middle line:84%
You imagine that you're already
on the cruise, what you're

00:24:50.054 --> 00:24:52.647 align:middle line:84%
going to wear, what it would
smell like, the salty air,

00:24:52.647 --> 00:24:53.447 align:middle line:90%
the people.

00:24:53.447 --> 00:24:55.616 align:middle line:90%
You get excited about it.

00:24:55.616 --> 00:24:57.284 align:middle line:90%
It's about the feeling tone.

00:24:57.284 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:84%
If you can not just connect from
arm's length with that vision,

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.147 align:middle line:84%
but with a feeling
tone of how it would

00:25:03.147 --> 00:25:06.467 align:middle line:84%
feel if you were
actually on that cruise

00:25:06.467 --> 00:25:09.889 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying yourself, and put
yourself there, like as if it's

00:25:09.889 --> 00:25:12.626 align:middle line:84%
actually happening, and let that
be the last thought you have

00:25:12.626 --> 00:25:15.827 align:middle line:84%
as you drift into
dreaming, it's as if you're

00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:18.092 align:middle line:84%
telling your subconscious
mind help me out

00:25:18.092 --> 00:25:19.339 align:middle line:90%
with this a little bit more.

00:25:19.339 --> 00:25:22.476 align:middle line:84%
Let's continue this, and make
it so it's a comfortable knowing

00:25:22.476 --> 00:25:26.143 align:middle line:84%
within your subconscious mind
and what your subconscious

00:25:26.143 --> 00:25:29.592 align:middle line:84%
mind accepts as safe and
real, and acceptable for you,

00:25:29.592 --> 00:25:32.735 align:middle line:84%
then it tends to get on
the bandwagon of all right

00:25:32.735 --> 00:25:34.527 align:middle line:84%
now let's manifest this
or womanifest this,

00:25:34.527 --> 00:25:35.489 align:middle line:90%
as the case may be.

00:25:35.489 --> 00:25:38.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What did you
bring us here some cards?

00:25:38.358 --> 00:25:39.611 align:middle line:90%
Dream Oracle cards.

00:25:39.611 --> 00:25:40.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: I did.

00:25:40.694 --> 00:25:41.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What are these?

00:25:41.662 --> 00:25:42.496 align:middle line:90%
Let's open this up.

00:25:42.496 --> 00:25:44.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: These?

00:25:44.665 --> 00:25:46.653 align:middle line:84%
They're just sort
of like tarot cards,

00:25:46.653 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and these are based on 53 of
the most common dream symbols.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:50.804 align:middle line:90%
Here, you pick one.

00:25:50.804 --> 00:25:51.638 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it.

00:25:51.638 --> 00:25:52.372 align:middle line:90%
We could play it like that.

00:25:52.372 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: All right.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.074 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
Fifty three cards.

00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:55.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I'll pick a dream.

00:25:55.008 --> 00:25:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Yeah, so you
can-- >> Noory: What is this?

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: You
picked the elevator card.

00:25:58.378 --> 00:25:59.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: There you go.

00:25:59.746 --> 00:26:01.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: So this is
one way that you can play with

00:26:01.481 --> 00:26:02.916 align:middle line:84%
these is to pick
a card every day.

00:26:02.916 --> 00:26:05.285 align:middle line:84%
This is the most common way
that people like to use it.

00:26:05.285 --> 00:26:06.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:26:06.085 --> 00:26:08.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: And you
can think of it as like a focal

00:26:08.543 --> 00:26:10.741 align:middle line:84%
point for the day, and it's
based on dream symbols,

00:26:10.741 --> 00:26:13.191 align:middle line:84%
which are based on things that
we deal with in our waking

00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:13.393 align:middle line:90%
lives.

00:26:13.393 --> 00:26:14.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: The elevator card?

00:26:14.528 --> 00:26:16.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Yeah,
it's a common dream.

00:26:16.445 --> 00:26:18.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now does that mean
my life is going up and down?

00:26:18.865 --> 00:26:19.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: You're
moving up in the world honey.

00:26:19.533 --> 00:26:21.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or down.

00:26:21.386 --> 00:26:22.636 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Depending.

00:26:22.636 --> 00:26:26.146 align:middle line:84%
So elevator is
about what container

00:26:26.146 --> 00:26:28.452 align:middle line:90%
is taking you up in the world.

00:26:28.452 --> 00:26:30.577 align:middle line:84%
What's-- what's-- you're
always wanting to elevate.

00:26:30.577 --> 00:26:33.680 align:middle line:84%
People always want to
rise in consciousness.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.415 align:middle line:90%
They want to rise in wealth.

00:26:35.415 --> 00:26:38.641 align:middle line:84%
Rise in well being, but
sometimes in a dream

00:26:38.641 --> 00:26:41.521 align:middle line:84%
you press the button and
the elevator goes sideways,

00:26:41.521 --> 00:26:45.075 align:middle line:84%
or it goes down, or you go
through the roof so to me

00:26:45.075 --> 00:26:48.328 align:middle line:84%
an elevator as a message,
there's a guidebook.

00:26:48.328 --> 00:26:49.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Is this a good dream?

00:26:49.706 --> 00:26:51.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
Most of the time it is.

00:26:51.498 --> 00:26:54.701 align:middle line:84%
I think some people have
different experiences with it.

00:26:54.701 --> 00:26:57.437 align:middle line:84%
I had one guy that always
had these out of the roof,

00:26:57.437 --> 00:26:59.768 align:middle line:84%
over the top elevator
dreams, but there's

00:26:59.768 --> 00:27:01.952 align:middle line:84%
a guidebook that gives
you a message, a meaning,

00:27:01.952 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and a mantra for each card,
and if you-- so the message

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:84%
is something to think
about in the waking--

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.462 align:middle line:84%
in your waking world so the
message in the guidebook

00:27:09.462 --> 00:27:13.038 align:middle line:84%
essentially tells you if you
pull this card that it means

00:27:13.038 --> 00:27:14.955 align:middle line:84%
that you're going places,
you're rising above,

00:27:14.955 --> 00:27:16.899 align:middle line:84%
and it also says, as
a little key note,

00:27:16.899 --> 00:27:19.362 align:middle line:84%
rise above, so if there's
any circumstances that

00:27:19.362 --> 00:27:21.995 align:middle line:84%
are like you've got petty
grievances, not that you would,

00:27:21.995 --> 00:27:23.995 align:middle line:84%
but if there's something
that's like bugging you

00:27:23.995 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:84%
on kind of a lower
level, rise above it.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.752 align:middle line:84%
Remember that you're
a higher being

00:27:28.752 --> 00:27:30.741 align:middle line:84%
and connect with
your higher status.

00:27:30.741 --> 00:27:33.324 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the message if
you're-- or the meaning if you

00:27:33.324 --> 00:27:36.009 align:middle line:84%
dream about it, and then there's
a little mantra that gives--

00:27:36.009 --> 00:27:37.644 align:middle line:84%
you want to hear what
your mantra is George?

00:27:37.644 --> 00:27:38.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure, love to hear it.

00:27:38.312 --> 00:27:39.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Okay.

00:27:39.012 --> 00:27:40.013 align:middle line:90%
Let's-- here.

00:27:40.013 --> 00:27:43.617 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if I hit no-- >>
Noory: And there's no question,

00:27:43.617 --> 00:27:47.554 align:middle line:84%
a dream state is a very powerful
tool in your day to day life.

00:27:47.554 --> 00:27:48.755 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:27:48.755 --> 00:27:49.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
Yes, yeah, yeah,

00:27:49.733 --> 00:27:52.418 align:middle line:84%
yeah so here's your mantra, and
everybody who's watching and/or

00:27:52.418 --> 00:27:54.446 align:middle line:84%
listening: I am moving
up in the world,

00:27:54.446 --> 00:27:59.494 align:middle line:84%
and I grow from glory to
greater glory and glowy.

00:27:59.494 --> 00:28:01.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Is that because
I picked the elevator card?

00:28:01.702 --> 00:28:03.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden: Yes,
that's your message today.

00:28:03.003 --> 00:28:04.371 align:middle line:90%
You're moving up.

00:28:04.371 --> 00:28:06.039 align:middle line:90%
Things are going your way.

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:07.575 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'd say
the message was.

00:28:07.575 --> 00:28:08.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Dreams.

00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Sullivan Walden: Dreams.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Powerful aren't they?

00:28:10.877 --> 00:28:14.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Sullivan Walden:
Beyond belief.

00:28:14.381 --> 00:28:17.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, you know in the
dream state you can accomplish

00:28:17.183 --> 00:28:18.085 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things.

00:28:18.085 --> 00:28:20.153 align:middle line:84%
You can meet people
that you want to meet.

00:28:20.153 --> 00:28:23.443 align:middle line:84%
You can better your
job or position

00:28:23.443 --> 00:28:25.625 align:middle line:84%
by concentrating on something,
and it really works,

00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:28.662 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't think it
does, try some techniques.

00:28:28.662 --> 00:28:32.399 align:middle line:84%
Try to do it, and
see what happens.

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:35.969 align:middle line:84%
We'll see you next time
on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:35.969 --> 00:28:37.219 align:middle line:90%
