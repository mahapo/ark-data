00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:10%
George Noory with you
and our special guest,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:10%
Sarah Adams, back with
us, an intuitive healer

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:10%
who from a little
age has experienced

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:10%
a wide range of
paranormal phenomena,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:10%
from abductions to angels.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And she has experienced her
supernatural and past lives

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, Atlantis,
telepathy, weather anomalies.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:84%
You name it, she's
gone through it.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Sarah, welcome back.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SARAH ADAMS: Thank you.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me back.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have had
such a great response

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to your original "Beyond Belief"
with me a year, two years ago.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely
unbelievable, so it's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
great to have you
back with us again.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I am so
thankful for that.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:10%
I was able to kind of have
a lot of lovely people come

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:10%
in contact with me
because of this show.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit about
yourself and these gifts

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:90%
that I think you have.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
How did it start
and at what age?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: As a small
child, I always remember

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:84%
speaking to angels,
speaking to other beings.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that I
had a tough childhood.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
angels come to me

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and explain to me why
things were just not

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.860 align:middle line:84%
that great here on Earth and
why I was experiencing that.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I accepted to incarnate
into a tough childhood

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:84%
so I could understand
it, so I could

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
understand the suffering going
on in the world, especially

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:90%
with children.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that
I was able to gather

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
a lot of knowledge on
in this incarnation.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
reach out to them,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
or do you think that they
realized you needed some help

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:90%
and assistance?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They were going to
be with me since before I

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:90%
incarnated here.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:90%
They were going to-- that was--

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
they were going to come with
me during this incarnation

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:84%
here to help support me and
help me get through everything.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Did I request at times
maybe higher forces

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:90%
to even come and help me?

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:84%
There was always a
lot of love and bliss

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and all that, those
higher emotions.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And experiencing
a lot of deep pain

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
as a child sometimes
is tough, and that's

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:84%
when I would call in
for higher forces.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And they would come and
take any pain I had away.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
They would reassure
me that I was

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:84%
going to be OK, that they
were always there with me

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've
carried this with you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.780 align:middle line:84%
into your adult life
now, haven't you?

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a healer, tell
me some of the things you do.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Oh, people
call me a healer,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:90%
but it's a label I don't like.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe I just guide
people to heal themselves.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:90%
I believe that--

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.863 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:02:53.863 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:90%
They do it themselves.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe that only we each
ourselves has the power

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:90%
to heal ourselves.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else can heal us, but
we can be guided to heal.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:90%
And so I do that.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:90%
I guide people to heal.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I say, listen, you work
on different organs.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
You can tell your
organs literally

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
to heal, to become healthy,
to detox of anything negative.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's emotions or
toxins in your organs,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:90%
it will listen to you.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've found the
success rate of this

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.385 align:middle line:90%
to be probably like 90%.

00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked with clients
all around the world, thousands

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:90%
of clients.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just have
them concentrate.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I say, listen, use your
mind to tell your organ

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
to clear that energy,
to clear those emotions,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:90%
to bring in new energy.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:90%
And it works quite well.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say that
you're a facilitator primarily?

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I teach people that they
are powerful and divine

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and they have all this
within them already.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.182 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they don't believe
it, can they heal themselves?

00:03:59.182 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I have an amazing
power of persuasion,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you that.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I think the beginning
of healing on any level

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.500 align:middle line:90%
is believing in yourself.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
things that I really--

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I just tell them, you
know, you're amazing,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:90%
you're this kind of--

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:90%
I think it works.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
I think so much in the world
that we've been put down.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.833 align:middle line:84%
We put each other down,
and this is a problem.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're so used
to being put down

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.708 align:middle line:84%
that when we're lifted up, when
we have people just tell us

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:27.833 align:middle line:84%
nice things, it has such
a positive effect on our--

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:28.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's infectious.

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, yes.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.192 align:middle line:84%
So it usually works
to get them up there.

00:04:32.192 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Even if they don't
believe in themselves,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:90%
it usually does work.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I've
always believed, Sarah,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that this planet should be
doing exactly what you have said

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
to change the world,
rather than evil and hatred

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and putting people down
and everything else.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I recently--

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I came this morning
to your show,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and I know we have a
series of questions,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and I speak to those
who have passed.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.550 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my gifts,
and it's very beautiful.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And one experience I
had around this time

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I did the show with you
last year was this cemetery.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I went to this cemetery,
and I know it sounds morbid,

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:90%
but I love cemeteries.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I went to this cemetery because
these souls were requesting

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I come and speak to them.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.120 align:middle line:10%
So I sat in there and I just--

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.017 align:middle line:10%
I sat and I meditated
and did this prayer,

00:05:20.017 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:10%
and they came to me.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
All these souls came to me.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
They said, we're worried
about the state of the world.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:84%
We're worried that the
planet is polluted.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.302 align:middle line:84%
We're worried about
world leaders.

00:05:29.302 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All justified.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.892 align:middle line:90%
They're worried about politics.

00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
They're worried
about the systems

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
that we have in place are not
helping people how they should.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
They're worried
about their families.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And they worry even
though they've passed on.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:10%
And they came to me
and they told me this.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And they said that they wanted
me to get that message across.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And they came back this
morning, a lot of souls,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and told me this and said,
get the message across

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:90%
that nobody ever dies.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
We move on into other realms
or other incarnations,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:90%
and it's very beautiful.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But we are worried about
the state of this planet,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and we want that to change
into something positive

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:84%
because we have family
members we love,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and we want the world to become
a beautiful place so that it's

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:84%
not an experience of
negativity to incarnate here,

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
but rather an experience of
positivity, an experience that

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:90%
uplifts rather than destroys.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they get involved?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Do they make change or do they
just merely point things out

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.605 align:middle line:90%
like they have to you?

00:06:24.605 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They do as
much as they can.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:10%
I've known ghosts to
protect little children who

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.988 align:middle line:10%
are being abused, I've known
them to try to you know come

00:06:32.988 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:10%
and-- even when I was very
ill at one point in my life,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:10%
I was very, very sick, and they
would come and they would say,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:10%
OK, they'd try to
help heal me or they'd

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.450 align:middle line:10%
try to make jokes
to bring me up.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen them do all
sorts of things like this.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:90%
I had one lady--

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I bumped into this
girl, I didn't know her,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and I could see
that she had cancer.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And her mom was right next
to her, the ghost of her mom.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And she was like,
tell my daughter

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
that she needs to take
her meds and get healthy.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.633 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the girl and
I said, are you being healthy?

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:90%
She goes, no, I'm not.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
She said, my mom died
and I just want to die.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, your mom
doesn't want you to die.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:84%
She's right here
next to you and she's

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:84%
telling me to tell you that
she loves you and she wants

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:84%
to see you get healthier and
she wants you to take your meds

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:84%
and she wants you to get better
and live a happy, healthy life.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they in
shock when you say

00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:90%
that, your mom is right here?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, I was
able to describe her.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, your mom is
wearing this blue dress.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, my mom used
to always wear a blue dress.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:90%
And she was just crying.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:90%
She's like, thank you.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm
blessed to have that

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and I'm blessed that these
spirits interact with me

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and they bring all this
knowledge and all this love

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.187 align:middle line:84%
back to their loved ones
who are alive in this world

00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:90%
and it's a very beautiful thing.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has it ever
been to much for you,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:84%
where they just bombard you
to the point where you can't

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:90%
sleep, you can't do anything?

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I had some in England,
and they're like,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:84%
oh, you, can see us,
you can talk to us.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So I passed by this old
cemetery in England and there

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:90%
were some very old, sailors--

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who had died.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Died, obviously ghosts.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was with my now deceased
partner back then, Max Spiers.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.065 align:middle line:10%
And he-- I was like, we
have to go back home now.

00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:90%
They're following me.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.215 align:middle line:84%
There's probably 100
because they were,

00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:90%
like, you can see us.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:10%
So then they want me to get a
message across to their loved

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:10%
ones or sometimes even
to political leaders

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:10%
on a grand scale.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So they are very interactive in
what's happening in this world,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:84%
whether it's-- like I said--
to loved ones or on a political

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.592 align:middle line:84%
scale or what's
happening to the planet.

00:08:43.592 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:84%
They are very involved in that
and very worried about that.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there,
because you're

00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
very surrounded in light, but
is there a dark side to this

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:90%
where even you have to fight it?

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: When they've
been through trauma,

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:90%
sometimes they can be like--

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I feel like when,
let's say, they've

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
been through trauma
throughout their lifetime,

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:84%
they can just be in this
dark aura, this dark cloud.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And I help to bring
light to them.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll remind them of love
or just send them love.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting
because when that happens,

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.447 align:middle line:84%
it's like that darkness
kind of just fades away.

00:09:19.447 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dissipates.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:90%
And then they're free.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're free to go and
incarnate or go to light

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:90%
or go wherever they want.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:90%
I believe a lot of--

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
we have some very
terrible hauntings

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
in the world where there's
some very scary hauntings.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe those are the ones
who've had a lot of trauma

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and they need us to go
and send light to them

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
so that they can pass
and they can be OK.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience where
I was told a long time ago

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:84%
we had practices where
when somebody died,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.247 align:middle line:90%
we would give them light.

00:09:48.247 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:84%
We would imagine sending them
light that would send them

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
a lot of energy so
that they could then

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:90%
go into the higher realms.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of souls
that are just stuck here

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.580 align:middle line:84%
because they have,
like you said,

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.330 align:middle line:84%
the dark aura because of the
trauma that happened to them.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.497 align:middle line:90%
And they're just stuck here.

00:10:03.497 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
evil or anything.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:84%
They just need us
to understand how

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:84%
energy works and us to help
them so that they can move on.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet, though,
you've got like the devil who

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:90%
just doesn't like you.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:90%
You're cutting into his action.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I feel like there
are some dark forces that

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:90%
try to mess with me at times.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.658 align:middle line:90%
But I am very, very protected.

00:10:26.658 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm very protected and I feel
like I have a good heart.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I had somebody
send me a dark entity.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And this entity came to me
and it said, we can't we

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:84%
can't mess with anybody who
has their heart checker lit up.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the highest
magic is the heart.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:90%
And even they have feelings.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I spoke to it and it was
a very beautiful experience.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Because after I spoke to it--

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.180 align:middle line:90%
they tell me, they say--

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
even some dark
entities that are used,

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:84%
it's very well known
that there are ceremonies

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that go on with dark magic
to keep the consciousness

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:90%
of this world suppressed.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Those very beings, they
told me they do not

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
like that there are quote
masters or those who

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.735 align:middle line:90%
force them to do dark stuff.

00:11:10.735 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:90%
They don't like that.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They fight it?

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.602 align:middle line:90%
They don't like it.

00:11:13.602 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
they're forced to do it,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
like it themselves.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Intuitive
speaker Lee Harris

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
appeared on Gaia's
program "Open Minds"

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to talk about higher
frequencies on the planet.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.853 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE HARRIS:
Higher consciousness

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:10%
has become higher,
meaning so many

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:10%
of you in the past decade
or two have ascended

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:10%
much of your own
personal density,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:10%
meaning the next levels
of higher consciousness

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:10%
are now hitting the planet.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:10%
Many of you will
have experienced

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:10%
a temporal hold on consciousness
in some ways between 2012

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:10%
and 2016.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.140 align:middle line:10%
And now as you move
into the 2017 to 2025

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:10%
period, what we would
call golden consciousness

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:10%
is hitting the Earth.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:10%
Far from the seductive
name it sounds to be,

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:10%
it is quite destructive,
for it will destroy density

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:10%
at faster rates, which is
why at a planetary level,

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:10%
you are seeing this take place.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:10%
And at personal
levels, those of you

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:10%
who had long felt what you would
call awake, alive, ascended

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:10%
are finding that suddenly,
the speed is increasing

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:10%
all over again and you are
going deeper and further out

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:10%
than humans have for
a very long time.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:10%
For we will say
that back in time,

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.150 align:middle line:10%
humans were able to go very
far for a short period of time

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:10%
before what you would know as
the energetic clamp got put

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:10%
onto the mindset and the
energy field of humanity,

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:10%
that clamp which is now
in an almighty battle

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:10%
to restore itself, not
necessarily for the purposes

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.398 align:middle line:10%
of humanity but instead for
the purposes of the universe.

00:12:49.398 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks
like, Sarah, he was

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of trance state.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Was he?

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And he has just
beautiful energy.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who does he
communicate with when

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:90%
he's doing stuff like that?

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.175 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I feel like
he's communicating

00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:02.482 align:middle line:84%
with what I call God's
source or God force itself.

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which you
have tapped into, too.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Eternal flow of energy
everywhere, which I believe

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:90%
is the real true God.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I guess God is a terrible
label, but that's

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:90%
the way people understand it.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can anybody
get it to this mode

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.820 align:middle line:84%
like Lee Harris has
or you have in order

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.590 align:middle line:90%
to reach the other side?

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:90%
God is not biased.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:84%
God is there if we
want to tap into that.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:10%
No matter how you look, no
matter what gender you are,

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:10%
what race, it doesn't
matter-- what age--

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:10%
you can tap into God.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.245 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
we have been taught

00:13:36.245 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:10%
that you must have a religion
or you must have this

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.160 align:middle line:10%
or that to tap into
God, and that's a lie.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.323 align:middle line:84%
God is an eternal
force of energy

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that runs through
everything-- through nature,

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:84%
through everything, through
the stars, through the sun,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
through the heavens,
through all.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:90%
And we can tap into that.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:84%
We just, like I said, we have to
get rid of all of these belief

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.230 align:middle line:84%
systems that have
been put into us.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And we need just
to go within and we

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:84%
need to tap into
ourselves because God

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:90%
is within ourselves.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:90%
God is our soul.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I believe that all souls are God
energy within the human body.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And we often, we're
not one with our soul.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
We live in 3D physical
reality without being

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
one with our soul, and this
is where a lot of problems

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:19.830 align:middle line:90%
have come from.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
We tap into God when we go
within and tap into our soul.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem to be, Sarah,
an extremely positive person--

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:90%
extremely positive.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
How do you combat the negativity
that's out there in the world

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:90%
all the time?

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So when you tap
into that force, God,

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:90%
it's unconditional love.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds you that death,
any hardships, are nothing.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:90%
You're eternal.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:90%
You;re-- you have--

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
ever have a bad day?

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.702 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Of course I have bad--

00:14:48.702 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're human.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Of course
I have bad days.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a human-- sorry,
I'm in a human incarnation.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:90%
So yes, I do have a bad day.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But at the end, throughout the
day, I often pray and meditate.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm continuously going
back and tapping into God

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:90%
continuously, tapping into God.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I bring all my problems
to God, and God

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
shows me the ways fix them
or helps me with them.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.635 align:middle line:90%
So I could say that it's--

00:15:16.635 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and I've been through
a lot of trauma,

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
as I stated, as a child or even
losing somebody I really loved.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:90%
It was very hard.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.782 align:middle line:84%
I came back from all
of that because of God,

00:15:25.782 --> 00:15:26.990 align:middle line:90%
me tapping into that source--

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
tougher, to be sure.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.535 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: There was one point
where I remember that--

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:90%
I've always followed.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I've always aligned myself to
this energy in way-- what it

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:90%
shows me in visions and dreams.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:84%
It gives me emotions, it speaks
to me in many different ways.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Even I will be driving and this
song will come on the radio--

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I have asked a
question or let's say

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I'll be having a hard
day this song will

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
come on that says, cheer up or
everything's going to be OK.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that God is
speaking to me through people,

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:90%
through everything around me.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So I really, really
have that support.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Did I have a really bad time
when somebody I love died?

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I had a very bad time.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And I was dying, I was very ill.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.393 align:middle line:90%
And I remember I--

00:16:13.393 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were that sick?

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I was that sick.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:90%
I was that sick.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just
God saying, listen,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.307 align:middle line:84%
I know you're having a hard
time in this incarnation

00:16:22.307 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:90%
but you're going to be OK.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to restore you.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be OK.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Just keep walking with me.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have healed and I've
become back happy again

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and blissful and just
very fulfilled in my life.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not only have you
had angelic experiences,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
but you have had
extraterrestrial experiences.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about that and
how did that start?

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Oh, as a child.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.372 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:16:47.372 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
happened to you as a child.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You know
what, but I remember

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
incarnate and with
a lot of forces

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:90%
that were surrounding me.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of came into the body
and they were like, we're here.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
You're in a 3D human experience,
we're here now with you.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.478 align:middle line:84%
So as a child, I've had very
many different ET experiences.

00:17:07.478 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physical
or telepathy-type?

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Both.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
As a child, too, I was having
a hard time in my body.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And with the abuse I
was having a child,

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:84%
it was causing the
heart time for me.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was taken into a ship
where some ETs worked on me.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And they said, your
body is not working

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:84%
right because the soul
I am, it's so different.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So they were like, listen,
your body is having a hard time

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.157 align:middle line:84%
containing your soul because
of all the energy that's--

00:17:43.157 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And was it?

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, it was.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I was having a hard time--
a very, very hard time.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'd just curl up in pain.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So they took me to the ship,
they worked on me for a while,

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and then after that
I was completely OK.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They realigned you.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:90%
They realigned me.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So they would come to me
and help me with that.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:84%
They would make sure
that I was protected

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
until I grew older so I could
use my own abilities to shield

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:84%
They explained to me
about hybrid children.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So they said that a
lot of hybrid children

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
had been created to help the
consciousness of the planet

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:84%
go up but that there
was a disconnect

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.182 align:middle line:84%
between the hybrid
children and their mothers.

00:18:21.182 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:90%
So they brought me in a ship.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:10%
There were all these
hybrid children.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:10%
And they said we want--

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.940 align:middle line:10%
because I had learned a little
more of the human experience,

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:10%
they wanted me to connect
telepathically and emotionally

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:10%
to the children and let
them know everything's

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:10%
going to be OK, download the
information I'd experienced

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:10%
into them.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Because apparently,
the hybrid children

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:90%
feel emotions very, very deeply.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And what they were doing is
they were getting sick and ill

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:84%
because they were streaming out
their parents' and their moms'

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%
emotions and all
that just karma,

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:90%
gunk that they had not cleared.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And the little hybrid
children were being so

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed this was kind
of causing them to be almost

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:84%
like it was tormenting
them from being overwhelmed

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So they would have to bring the
children back up to the ships

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:84%
and they would give the
children what I call time off,

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:84%
where they didn't have to
karmically help clear anything.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And these children would
be connected to them

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.320 align:middle line:84%
telepathically and they
would just give sort of them

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:84%
emotions of bliss and all
of those higher emotions

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
to restore their energy
fields so that their energy

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:90%
fields were OK.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So I was requested to go in and
kind of download my information

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and calm them down
and say, listen,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I've learned some things
about being on this planet--

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you were just a
kid when this was happening?

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.872 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I was actually
probably around that age.

00:19:40.872 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I was a teenager
when that happened.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
say they worked on you,

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:84%
was it a physical thing
or a mental thing?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:90%
What did they do?

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So they worked on
my energy field

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.970 align:middle line:90%
to align it more with my body.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I do believe this is the
medicine of the future.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
From what I see, we're
like a net of a whole bunch

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:90%
of multicolored energy threads.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what creates
the physical 3D body.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And so they worked
on it almost like--

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.560 align:middle line:84%
have you ever seen
Native Americans, how

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:90%
they have the lady who weaves?

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:84%
She's working and she's
supposed to be weaving reality?

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.080 align:middle line:84%
This is how a lot
of our being is.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a wave.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Native
Americans get it.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:90%
They understand it.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.307 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, they do.

00:20:28.307 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Including the rainbow aura.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.513 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of work on that.

00:20:31.513 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:90%
But that's how we are.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have
where you're depressed

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.810 align:middle line:84%
or stuff, that's negative
weaves of threads

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and I'd see them
as black or gray.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they remove that and
it would affect your energy.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they alien greys
or did they look like us?

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.190 align:middle line:90%
What did they look like?

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I communicate with
a lot of different beings--

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
reptilians, the grays, all
sorts of beings, by the way.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be
my take on my experience

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:90%
with reptilians and with grays.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.470 align:middle line:84%
One, I have experienced a lot
of good things with grays,

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:90%
but I feel there's two types.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.790 align:middle line:84%
There were ones that I feel
like more military-style that I

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:84%
had encountered that
were almost like not

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.435 align:middle line:84%
ETs, but rather something that
was maybe created or cloned up.

00:21:23.435 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little
too aggressive?

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And then there was what I
call the original grays were

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:90%
actually really kind and caring.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
They were very
interested in making

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
sure the children
of humanity were OK

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and in bringing
consciousness up.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle line:90%
So I've had those encounters.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.970 align:middle line:90%
And then I've had encounters--

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.785 align:middle line:84%
I had an encounter
with a reptilian chief

00:21:41.785 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:84%
because they're more
tribal reptilians.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.868 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem
dangerous to me.

00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Are they?

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You know what, when
you're tapped into God force,

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:90%
you're not scared of anything.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they told me, they said
that they feed off of energy.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So as much as humanity
feeds off of food,

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:90%
they feed off of energy.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So the reptilian chief said,
listen, humanity is suffering.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:84%
They're having a lot of
issues, but so is my species.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:90%
He said, so are my kin.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:90%
We're suffering too.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Because he said that
originally, there

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of priests
and priestesses

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that would open portals of
light and then these beings

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:90%
would feed off these.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
But they're starving because
these portals have been closed

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.872 align:middle line:90%
up since a long time ago.

00:22:23.872 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So they're starving,
they're having to feed off

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:90%
of the energy of humanity.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is harming each other,
so there's a lot of chaos.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So he was saying, listen,
if we don't feed, we die.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.077 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that
we need to return--

00:22:38.077 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:84%
he told me, he said,
we need to return

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:84%
to the original sort of the
original template of everything

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
where all species
got along, where

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:84%
there was no eating
each other's energy,

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.553 align:middle line:90%
there was no harming each other.

00:22:52.553 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling
me that's where

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:84%
we need to go back into the
sacred practices, where we need

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.570 align:middle line:84%
to have priests and priestesses
that will open these portals

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and do these different things
so that not only will it

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
nurture humanity, it's going to
nurture these other beings who

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:84%
are also starving of energy and
starving of different things

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:90%
that they need.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Barbara Lamb,
past life regressionist,

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.827 align:middle line:84%
talked on "Beyond Belief"
about some of these contacts.

00:23:17.827 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:10%
>>BARBARA LAMB: I
think people come in

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:10%
and they ask the
question, why me?

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:10%
Why are these things
happening to me and yet not

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.870 align:middle line:10%
to anybody else I know?

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:10%
And I would wonder if
that, too, of course.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:10%
So in a regression,
we can go back

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:10%
to the very source
of their having

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:10%
these experiences,
the beginning,

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:10%
the root of their
having these experiences

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:10%
with the
extraterrestrial beings.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:10%
And what has come out of
regressions like that,

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.480 align:middle line:10%
without my suggesting
it at all--

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:10%
I make no suggestions--

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:59.610 align:middle line:10%
the person has discovered
that just before coming

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:10%
into this lifetime as
the person they are,

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:10%
they've had sort of a
planning session as a soul.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:10%
And in that planning
session, they're

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:10%
deciding some of the
major types of things

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:10%
they'll be experiencing
in this life in order

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:10%
to learn from them,
to grow and develop.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:10%
And they'll decide who
the main people are

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:10%
going to be in
their life and where

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:10%
they will be in the world,
which culture, which religion,

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:10%
et cetera.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:10%
And in that planning
session, some

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:39.840 align:middle line:10%
of the souls of
extraterrestrial beings

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:10%
come in and ask if the person
would agree to work with them,

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:10%
cooperate with them here and
there in terms of projects

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.990 align:middle line:10%
that the beings are doing.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.650 align:middle line:10%
And in that planning
session of the soul,

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.860 align:middle line:10%
the soul has
decided, yes, I'll do

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.740 align:middle line:10%
that in addition to
all the other things

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm choosing to do
in that lifetime.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
resonate with you some?

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.790 align:middle line:90%
I told you I had soul planning.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah Same thing.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's one
of a kind, isn't she?

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: She's amazing, yes.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:90%
I know about some of her work.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.120 align:middle line:90%
She's amazing.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I will say this, though.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I will say that some of those
people who have incarnated who

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:84%
are getting abducted are
actually aliens that incarnated

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:84%
or they're higher beings
or different beings that

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:84%
incarnated to have
a human experience

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and they need realigned
like I needed realigning.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So they're being
abducted because of that.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some of the
surgical stuff does go on.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they
realign, do they just

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
do it one time now for
you, or do you constantly

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:90%
need to be realigned?

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So the other day, I
was getting a hot stone massage

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, I realized
there's two beings.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:55.708 align:middle line:84%
And they had come
and they were just--

00:25:55.708 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were there?

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
They put their like
more wispy hands over me

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:90%
and were helping to realign me.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Because by doing a hot
stone massage, I was saying,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.780 align:middle line:90%
yes, I'm open to healing.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.453 align:middle line:84%
So they got that and they
were like, OK, you're

00:26:10.453 --> 00:26:12.370 align:middle line:84%
open to healing; we're
going to come and help.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:90%
We will get help.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.667 align:middle line:84%
See, a lot of people say, OK,
why aren't angels helping me?

00:26:16.667 --> 00:26:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm having such a
bad time, why aren't

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:90%
higher beings helping me?

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to literally
do the steps.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't just say,
oh, I want help.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:23.124 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:23.124 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't get
the help, do they?

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Well, it's the steps.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.650 align:middle line:90%
You have to do the steps.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:84%
You have to really
change your diet,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.310 align:middle line:84%
you have to do different
things to earn it.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.023 align:middle line:90%
You have to prove I'm not--

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's not
just handed to you.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It's not
just handed to you.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:90%
You've got to prove.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.240 align:middle line:90%
It's just like abilities.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very
good at doing stuff

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
like remote viewing and
astral projection and stuff,

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:90%
but I have to earn it.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And if I ever do anything
bad with it, misuse it,

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:90%
it's taken away from me.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize, imagine
if everybody had abilities

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and they were not
using them right.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It would make the world an
even more horrible place,

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:90%
more chaotic place than now.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Humans have so many
capabilities in them, and what

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I call superpowers
that they can only

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:84%
access once they start to
take control of themselves

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and build themselves
up and earn it.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have any
regrets that this has

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.970 align:middle line:90%
happened to you over the years?

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No downside?

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:90%
I feel I'm very blessed.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they save you?

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: God saves me, God
that eternal force saves me.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did God send
the ETs, the angels?

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Many of
the highest beings,

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:84%
very ancient beings like
ETs, are allied to God force.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.690 align:middle line:84%
They understand that
that is life given.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a river, it's an ocean
that's eternally life given.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
are aligned to it.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The physical world
and the spiritual world

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:90%
sometimes mesh.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the objects
that are associated with them?

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you use anything like
crystals or anything like that?

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.828 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I had just this
recently this download,

00:28:02.828 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and it said, stop taking
crystals from the Earth.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.103 align:middle line:90%
This is like taking--

00:28:06.103 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stop, really?

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And it said, all we
need is within us.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:84%
We just need to
realize that and we

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:13.240 align:middle line:84%
need to stop using
objects around us.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:90%
And crystals are amazing.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.510 align:middle line:84%
They are amazing and I'm
very thankful for them.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's almost like--

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you use them?

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.257 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I'm not buying
anymore since this download.

00:28:21.257 --> 00:28:23.132 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you've got
what you need, right?

00:28:23.132 --> 00:28:24.405 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I already have them.

00:28:24.405 --> 00:28:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
get rid of them.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I might put some back
in nature, but I'm not

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
going to buy anymore
since the download.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.980 align:middle line:84%
The most power that I
find is within myself

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:90%
when I tap into God force.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
insane, intense power.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a library of everything
and anything I could possibly.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain
that, the God force.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.185 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It's that energy, that
force that runs through nature.

00:28:47.185 --> 00:28:48.310 align:middle line:90%
It runs through all of us.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're alive.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.470 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't have energy
running through you,

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.237 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't be alive.

00:28:53.237 --> 00:28:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we can up that energy
and when we up that energy,

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
we're upping that
God force through us.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's an internal energy
that runs through everything--

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.430 align:middle line:84%
through the universes,
through the stars,

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:90%
through the suns, everything.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What gives
us that energy, Sarah?

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Do we create it or
is it given to us?

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: This energy
constantly creates.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And we are allowed to
tap into it as much as we

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:90%
want or is less as we want.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:84%
The more we tap into it,
the more we are fulfilled,

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.180 align:middle line:84%
the more we are healed, the
more we have what I call

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:84%
"soul-lutions," solutions for
all within our soul energy,

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:84%
solutions to all our
world's problems,

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:84%
whether it's starvation, whether
it's emotional suffering,

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:90%
all suffering.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Once we tap into that, we will
find solutions there for this.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.838 align:middle line:84%
When we refuse to
tap into it, when

00:29:39.838 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:84%
we have just a little bit of
energy running through us,

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.390 align:middle line:84%
we will start to
get sick, we will

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.395 align:middle line:90%
start to have lower emotions.

00:29:44.395 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people say we
have crystals in the brain.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
We have a Gaia show, "Brain
Crystals and Psychic Powers."

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: This is
magnetite, one of the most

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:10%
magnetic substances on Earth.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:10%
As you can probably guess, it
has a diverse range of uses,

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.850 align:middle line:10%
from fridge magnets to
generating electricity

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:10%
in power plants.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:10%
But what you probably
wouldn't guess

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.022 align:middle line:10%
is that your brain actually
synthesizes these crystals,

00:30:11.022 --> 00:30:12.730 align:middle line:10%
and you have hundreds
of millions of them

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:10%
inside your head.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.510 align:middle line:10%
Scientists are still
unsure what role, if any,

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:10%
these crystals play in
the brain's function.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.450 align:middle line:10%
Studies have inferred
that it may play

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:10%
a role in long-term memory.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.700 align:middle line:10%
In animals like honeybees,
homing pigeons and dolphins,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:10%
magnetite is believed to be
associated with the ability

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:10%
to navigate based on the
Earth's magnetic field.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:10%
While similar studies have
yet to be performed on humans,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.220 align:middle line:10%
we do know that
Earth's magnetic fields

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:10%
affect everything from our
mood to our ability to learn.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.920 align:middle line:10%
Even stranger,
research has begun

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:10%
to prove links between
the electromagnetic field

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.285 align:middle line:10%
of our planet and
psychic abilities.

00:30:51.285 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:10%
Could these crystals
act like tiny antennas,

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:57.620 align:middle line:10%
connecting our brains to each
other and to the entire planet?

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:02.372 align:middle line:10%
It may sound far fetched, but
surprisingly there is evidence.

00:31:02.372 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
pretty fascinating.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: See, we
don't need crystals.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:05.990 align:middle line:90%
We have them in us.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you agree with that?

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, I do.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.287 align:middle line:90%
And I believe it--

00:31:09.287 --> 00:31:11.120 align:middle line:84%
so I believe that there's
an ancient crystal

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
system within this Earth
and within each planet that

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.970 align:middle line:84%
connects and kind of passes
energy to each other.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're connected to this
ancient crystal system,

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.765 align:middle line:84%
and it passes
information energy.

00:31:24.765 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're all
magnetic, aren't we?

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, we are.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you utilize tapping
into that to do anything?

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, very much.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I can tap into the Earth's field
all the time and speak to it.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You feel it?

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Oh, yes.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:90%
It speaks to me all the time.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I was able recently
to speak to the Earth

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.562 align:middle line:84%
about its magnetic field
and how it's off right now.

00:31:42.562 --> 00:31:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is off, isn't it?

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It's off due to pollution,
it's off due to satellites.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:52.990 align:middle line:84%
It's literally being affected
by our AI, by our satellites,

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.130 align:middle line:90%
by our Wi-Fi, by our 5G.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
It's being affected
by that and this

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.650 align:middle line:84%
is causing the Earth's
magnetic field to be off.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Earth did let
me know to tell humanity

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:07.700 align:middle line:10%
that they have the power
within them to literally tell

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:10%
the Earth's magnetic
field to come back

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.605 align:middle line:10%
into its original sort
of blueprint and heal.

00:32:13.605 --> 00:32:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it
doing to us, Sarah,

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.820 align:middle line:90%
the fact that it's off kilter?

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Oh.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So it was explaining to
me that it's some people--

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.190 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of
issues right now

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:84%
with people just acting
very strange and out of it.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Extremely.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:26.933 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, emotionally.

00:32:26.933 --> 00:32:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's having a negative effect
on the emotions of people.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.220 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's magnetic field
has an effect on emotions,

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.960 align:middle line:84%
it has an effect on
thoughts, it has an effect

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.273 align:middle line:84%
even on the fertility
of plants and crops.

00:32:38.273 --> 00:32:39.815 align:middle line:84%
So it said that
we're going to have--

00:32:39.815 --> 00:32:43.880 align:middle line:84%
it said we will be having issues
with crops, with emotions,

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:90%
with all sorts of things.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going to be
off because of the Earth's

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:90%
magnetic field being off.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we physically
change it ourself?

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: We can.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So I saw that we needed to get
groups together and meditate

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth's magnetic
field and request

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:90%
that it goes back into place.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have this ability to
stream energy through us,

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and we have that
God-given ability.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.060 align:middle line:84%
As I said, when we
bring our energy up,

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.710 align:middle line:90%
we're closer to God's source.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And that literally tells
the elements what to do,

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.520 align:middle line:90%
the physical elements.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And we can use that
God-given power

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to tell this Earth to heal
and to heal ourselves and heal

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:18.770 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're out,
maybe a party or something,

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:25.730 align:middle line:84%
can you feel somebody who
lacks that kind of field?

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.547 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I don't party.

00:33:27.547 --> 00:33:28.630 align:middle line:90%
When I walk in the store--

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or if you're
in a crowd or something.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.227 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: When I
walk in the store,

00:33:31.227 --> 00:33:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I can feel so many people
depleted energetically.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I often will
just give them a lot of energy.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm able to shield.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.610 align:middle line:84%
But I try to give as much energy
because I believe that being--

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.010 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot in the
world who are takers

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:90%
and we must be givers.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't
that exhaust you?

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:52.800 align:middle line:84%
God is an eternal
source of energy,

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.760 align:middle line:84%
so I just continuously
go back and recharge.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.485 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:58.485 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And we need more
people doing this.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.185 align:middle line:84%
We need what I call
more portals of light.

00:34:02.185 --> 00:34:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So we've got what I call
portals of darkness, which

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.670 align:middle line:90%
are people who zap energy.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Negative.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Negative.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.969 align:middle line:90%
Psychic vampires I call them.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:09.409 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Right.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.117 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
they're just depleted.

00:34:11.117 --> 00:34:13.284 align:middle line:84%
That's because they've been
traumatized or different

00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:90%
And we need people that--

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.840 align:middle line:84%
we need somebody who's
a psychic vampire.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Rather than cut
that person off, we

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.989 align:middle line:84%
need a group of people who
are portals of light that's

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:25.370 align:middle line:84%
going to send them enough energy
to fill that deep, dark void

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.320 align:middle line:90%
and light them back up.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.909 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's your take on
these psychic vampires who,

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:37.370 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, are nice
people; they're not evil;

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:43.609 align:middle line:84%
they just don't know why people
want to run away from them?

00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:44.409 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Ooh.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:84%
They're a psychic vampire
one, because either past lives

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:49.370 align:middle line:84%
they've had trauma
that's carried down

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
into their aura in this
lifetime or they've

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
had trauma in this
lifetime or they're just so

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:90%
cut off from their souls.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.050 align:middle line:84%
We just have a lot of
people out there, honestly,

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.717 align:middle line:84%
that are cut off from
their souls, which

00:35:01.717 --> 00:35:04.560 align:middle line:84%
is God's source, which
caused them to be like this.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that can
be fixed when we go within.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And when we start to kind of
bring that energy into us,

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:15.650 align:middle line:84%
we become givers of
light in our life,

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:84%
rather than energy vampires
that just deplete ourselves

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.130 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to talk with
you for a moment in the time we

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.270 align:middle line:84%
have remaining about
artificial intelligence,

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:84%
AI, which you've
looked at a lot.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Gaia, of course, has a
series called "Deep Space."

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:35.986 align:middle line:90%
They dealt with AI.

00:35:35.986 --> 00:35:39.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: So AI people call
this the singularity for a very

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:10%
definite reason.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.430 align:middle line:10%
They liken it to the
physics of a black hole.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:47.470 align:middle line:10%
At the center a black hole, you
have a singularity, essentially

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.150 align:middle line:10%
a point of virtual
infinite density

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.400 align:middle line:10%
and infinite
gravitational power.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.200 align:middle line:10%
And in that type
of crazy physics,

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.350 align:middle line:10%
all of the physics that we
have don't seem to apply.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how to predict
things at the singularity.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.530 align:middle line:10%
And this is what
AI theorists are

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:10.490 align:middle line:10%
saying, when computing
intelligence exceeds our own,

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:10%
we human beings will
then have the ability

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:10%
to predict the trajectory
of our civilization.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:10%
We're basically going to be
losing control over this car

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.140 align:middle line:10%
that we think we're driving.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And it's now the dominant
intelligence will be behind us.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.660 align:middle line:10%
And what will that
dominant intelligance do?

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.370 align:middle line:10%
Will it merge with us, as
Kurzweil thinks, a combination

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:31.100 align:middle line:10%
of human-machine
hybrid intelligence

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.910 align:middle line:10%
where we'll be some
freakish bunch of creatures

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:10%
living for 500 years
and IQs of 1,000

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:10%
totally unlike what we are?

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.593 align:middle line:10%
Or will the computers
think, humanity?

00:36:41.593 --> 00:36:43.010 align:middle line:10%
Let's pull a
"Terminator" on them.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.160 align:middle line:10%
We have no idea.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:44.960 align:middle line:10%
We don't know.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.590 align:middle line:10%
Or will they be our willing
slaves and make our world

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.060 align:middle line:10%
a paradise?

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.210 align:middle line:10%
Who knows.

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's a singularity.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.490 align:middle line:84%
We can't really
predict any of this.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will AI
conflict, Sarah,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.390 align:middle line:84%
on some of the things that
we've been talking about today?

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Will it hurt it?

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I believe that
AI kind of keeps us away

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:90%
from our true power.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power within
us, that's the power of energy.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it hurts us.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.672 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it hurts us and
I believe it hurts the planet.

00:37:12.672 --> 00:37:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe it hurts the animals,
I believe it hurts nature,

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that it's very
destructive to this planet.

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.620 align:middle line:84%
In my downloads, I got
that AI comes from 1D.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:10%
It's what I call a false power.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.310 align:middle line:84%
We have been told
that it's powerful,

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:32.090 align:middle line:84%
that it's just this almighty
sort of technology when

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.510 align:middle line:84%
actually, it cannot compare to
the technology we have when we

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.690 align:middle line:90%
light ourselves up.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.890 align:middle line:84%
We will be telepathic,
we will have

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:84%
power over all the
elements, we will

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.090 align:middle line:84%
be able to travel
interplanetarily.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff was
lost a long time ago.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.140 align:middle line:90%
It was never achieved with AI.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:52.940 align:middle line:10%
It was achieved by learning how
to stream that energy we have

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.970 align:middle line:10%
within us, through us on
a more powerful level,

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.790 align:middle line:10%
and how to work with
that, not AI intelligence.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see AI as
perhaps one of our biggest

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:03.380 align:middle line:90%
dangers?

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Oh, I do.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like it.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I do.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So some years ago in
England, I literally

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:13.850 align:middle line:84%
was drawn out of my body
to a group of sperm whales

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:90%
that were beaching themselves.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And I went to try
to speak to them,

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and they speak often
through colors and emotions.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was requesting that
they don't beach themselves.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was asking them
why they were doing this.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, the whales
started to say to me,

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:90%
no, we want to die.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And they said, listen,
we're going to show you.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I merged
with their consciousness

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.380 align:middle line:90%
and I could hear--

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.250 align:middle line:84%
it was like rock music,
heavy metal music constantly.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.092 align:middle line:90%
The AI satellites--

00:38:45.092 --> 00:38:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
driving them crazy.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:52.070 align:middle line:84%
The AI satellite systems, the
waves they're sending down,

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.420 align:middle line:84%
it's literally--
because in the ocean,

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:59.360 align:middle line:84%
it's literally more loud because
the water is magnifying it.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was like they were living
every single day like hearing

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.310 align:middle line:90%
metal music in their heads.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.490 align:middle line:90%
It's driving them mad.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So they let me know that they
wanted to beach themselves

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:84%
because they did not
want to live like that.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the way to get
away from it, kill themselves.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Exactly.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.560 align:middle line:84%
It's harming this
planet, it's harming

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.990 align:middle line:90%
the animal life of this planet.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I thought
it was something like that.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: It is, yes.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:19.730 align:middle line:90%
It's terrible.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:20.450 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the worst--

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonar and
everything else,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.900 align:middle line:90%
it's just us bombarding them.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And we're all doing
it because of military stuff

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and because we
can't as a species

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.870 align:middle line:84%
learn to get along and
learn to uplift each other

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and learn to heal
and learn to seek

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.335 align:middle line:90%
life, rather than destruction.

00:39:37.335 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had
your way, would you

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.673 align:middle line:84%
stop all artificial
intelligence work?

00:39:41.673 --> 00:39:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, I would.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Instantly.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'd start focusing on
the work of spiritual work

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.450 align:middle line:84%
on how energy streams through
us and how we can actually

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.690 align:middle line:84%
light up this ancient system,
like the crystals system that

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:56.840 align:middle line:84%
passes information through
us and through every--

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.080 align:middle line:84%
whether through planets, through
suns, through solar systems.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I would start working
on that because that

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.580 align:middle line:84%
is what controls the
very elements that are

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and we have power
over all of that.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Our power when we light
up is immense beyond.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It's like Superman.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Are you glad you have these
abilities to help people?

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I am thankful for them.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.848 align:middle line:84%
I can see that I've been
able to help a lot of people.

00:40:18.848 --> 00:40:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And yourself
as well, right?

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: And myself as well.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
probably the initial key.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.770 align:middle line:90%
So what advice, Sarah--

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:25.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're God-given.

00:40:25.895 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: If I didn't
walk the path--

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.048 align:middle line:84%
I always have to
clean and clarify.

00:40:29.048 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't, they would
be removed from me.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.843 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What advice
would you give somebody

00:40:32.843 --> 00:40:36.380 align:middle line:84%
who, like you, had
a rough childhood,

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.800 align:middle line:84%
is an adult probably right
now listening and watching

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.010 align:middle line:84%
this program, and they
want to tap into this

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.510 align:middle line:90%
and they just don't know how?

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.280 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
they should do?

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.045 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So one,
visualization meditation.

00:40:49.045 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Start to get on a healthy
diet, start to go within.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.470 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of
prayer, going within.

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of exercises
like imagining

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:90%
beautiful water washing over--

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.802 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yoga, stuff like that?

00:40:59.802 --> 00:41:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Just simple
like this, imagine water

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.560 align:middle line:84%
washing anything
negative out my aura,

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.080 align:middle line:84%
imagine a golden light
pouring into my aura.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And I do that to
my different organs

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:09.260 align:middle line:90%
and do a lot of rainbow colors.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And this just amazingly--
within seconds,

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.420 align:middle line:84%
you start to feel it once you
do those sorts of exercises.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It happens
that quickly.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it does.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people, what percent,

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.360 align:middle line:84%
do you think might be
walking around this planet

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:27.140 align:middle line:84%
right now not tuned in,
not the way they should be?

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I'd say
most of humanity.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why humanity
is in the state it is.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:36.322 align:middle line:84%
And when they start to tap into
each other, into themselves,

00:41:36.322 --> 00:41:38.030 align:middle line:84%
they will tap into
each other and they'll

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
start to have this empathy
and this compassion.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Because they will
feel when they're

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:44.760 align:middle line:84%
hurting another person and
they won't be able to it.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.093 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the best
advice you could give a parent?

00:41:47.093 --> 00:41:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Oh, teach them love
and compassion and just be open.

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Don't impose
religion or anything

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.440 align:middle line:90%
that's going to close them up.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.880 align:middle line:10%
And teach them about energy.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.960 align:middle line:10%
Teach them that they are
much more than a 3D body,

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.345 align:middle line:10%
that there's spirit in the body.

00:42:01.345 --> 00:42:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief" again.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Thanks you.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always
good seeing you.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Thank you.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If people want to get
a hold of you, how do they find?

00:42:08.705 --> 00:42:12.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So you can find
me at www.sarahradams.com.

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:13.320 align:middle line:10%
That's my website.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.370 align:middle line:10%
Super.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:15.170 align:middle line:10%
You've heard it.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.500 align:middle line:10%
She's an intuitive, but
she's much more than that.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.830 align:middle line:10%
She has the ability to
empower individuals to bring

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:23.840 align:middle line:10%
the very best out of everybody.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
