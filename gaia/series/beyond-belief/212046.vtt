you so much, George.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.103 align:middle line:84%
in spiritual work the
way you're doing it?

00:00:38.103 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: You know,
it's a long story,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.187 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably
fit for a movie.

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'll give you the machine
gun version of my story.

>>NOORY: You got it.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:10%
>>SARGEANT: So I used to
have a very different life.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.273 align:middle line:10%
I used to smuggle drugs,
guns for a living.

00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:10%
I was involved in
lots of high-profile--

>>NOORY: Really?

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.593 align:middle line:10%
>>SARGEANT: --bank frauds.

00:00:54.593 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.403 align:middle line:10%
Did it for many years.

00:00:56.403 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:10%
And to be honest with
you, I enjoyed it.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES] I didn't have
any plan on changing things.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I was with
my ex-wife and children.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And we were traveling from
a place called Piatra Neamt

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.380 align:middle line:84%
to Bucharest Airport in
Romania early one morning.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I was asleep in a taxi,
and my ex-wife and children

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:90%
were in the back.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:90%
And I heard a loud crash.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:90%
There's wind, and there's glass.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:90%
I wake up.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:84%
The car's swaying
from side to side.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking to myself,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.022 align:middle line:90%
boy, we're in a bad accident.

00:01:27.022 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
We're either going to
hit the oncoming traffic,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:90%
or the car's going to flip over.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But then, all of a
sudden, we came to a stop.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:90%
And there's no cars on the road.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:90%
The car didn't flip.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
this is really weird.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's a hole
in the windscreen,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and there's blood
dripping down my face.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not bleeding.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
My daughter was underneath
the driver's seat.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I looked at the taxi driver.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:90%
He looked petrified.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
what's going on?

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.345 align:middle line:90%
So I got out of the taxi.

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I looked about 30
meters up the road,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.497 align:middle line:84%
and there's two ladies lying
on the side of the road.

00:01:56.497 --> 00:01:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I look about another
100 meters or so up the road,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and there's what looks
like a dead body.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
is three ladies

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
were crossing the
road in the morning.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.651 align:middle line:90%
The first one got hit clean on.

00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:08.984 align:middle line:90%
She came through the windscreen.

00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All together?

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.454 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah.

00:02:10.454 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The three?

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.301 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: The first lady
came through the windscreen,

00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
smashed me in the face
whilst I was asleep,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
got flipped over
the car and died.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Second one had her
ankles cut clean off,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and the third one
was physically OK.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:84%
So I've got out of the taxi,
checked on the missus and kids.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:84%
The two ladies on
the side of the road,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:84%
the one with her ankles
cut off, they're screaming.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.787 align:middle line:84%
A guy had come out
from a nearby factory.

00:02:30.787 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:90%
He was on the phone.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, he must have
called the emergency services.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Like, what can I do?

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So I was fixated on this
lump in the road, which

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:90%
looked like a dead body.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And I got closer and
closer walking up to it,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:90%
got within about 10 meters.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this energy hovering
above the body, which I now

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:90%
know was the lady's soul.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And up until this
point in my life,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe in
spirit, the universe--

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: None of that.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: --God.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: None of that.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: None of that stuff.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
for crazy people.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting closer
and closer to the body,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:90%
staring at this soul.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the energy just
fizzles off into the ether.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, I'm looking
down at the lady's body.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Her legs are wrapped
up over our heads,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and it was like someone had
taken an old car to the scrap

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:90%
heap.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Like, whatever was
inside the body,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:90%
it had no longer any use for it.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:90%
It had just gone.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this separation
between life and death

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and that something actually
is inside the body,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't unsee this.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And so this started
my spiritual journey.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, from there, it
just, like, escalated.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I ended up meeting
a lady, who became

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.550 align:middle line:90%
my first spiritual teacher.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
She worked for Scotland Yard
in the Psychic Division,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:84%
solving crimes with
spiritual gifts.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:84%
She had a past life
regression business.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I went to see her a few
times a week for years,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and she taught me
how to remote view,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
how to bring my light out
of my body and travel,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:90%
all different kinds of things.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
She regressed me into
hundreds of past lives.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.653 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a teacher that
upgraded me really quickly.

00:03:58.653 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you had
all the tools to do it.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
needed to maximize them.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, it
was really important.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I was
doing my criminal things.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And we were stealing
loads of money from banks.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.723 align:middle line:84%
And what actually happened is
we were getting so much money,

00:04:12.723 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know
what to do with it.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So I started giving it
to charities in Africa,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and we started building
schools and water pipelines.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
getting that much money?

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.917 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: It was
ridiculous amounts of money.

00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
letters were coming back

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
through the people
that helped me

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
put the money into the
charity saying, you did this,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and you did that, and
the emotional responses,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
it started to touch
me at a deep level.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And so it started to change me.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Because up until this point,
I was really egotistical.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.108 align:middle line:84%
I didn't give a rat's
ass about anybody else.

00:04:43.108 --> 00:04:44.775 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted money
and material things.

00:04:44.775 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take for yourself.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, just,
I was all about me.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
the money out of the banks?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: That's a long story.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:90%
So we used different solicitors.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
We used mortgage fraud, yeah,
various different means.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
banks fell for it?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: We were
good at what we did.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You must have.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: We were
good at what we did.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.348 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell you a little
bit more of the story,

00:05:10.348 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see how that
kind of came full circle.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big part
of my spiritual journey

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:84%
because we ended up moving
New Zealand back in 2009.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And I met a guy who
taught me how to meditate.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd never meditated
up until this point,

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and he had a pyramid
in his garden.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And I used to go
around there every day.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:84%
We set up a health and fitness
center, a mixed martial arts

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:90%
gym in New Zealand.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So we were helping
people through that.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And I used to go and see
this old guy every day,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.010 align:middle line:90%
sit in his pyramid.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me how to
meditate with my eyes open.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And I had loads of amazing
experiences, but one of them

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.090 align:middle line:90%
was really important.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.765 align:middle line:84%
I was sat there, and
a little space pod--

00:05:49.765 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
it's the only way I can describe
it-- landed in the garden next

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was a blue
being inside of it.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow, like a craft?

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Like a small craft?

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, craft.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So I brought my
light out of my body.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:90%
I went and got into this craft.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And the craft-- somehow,
it placed my consciousness

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of this portal.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they flew me
through the portal,

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and my light and my
essence caught up.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was above a
beach, and I knew

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:90%
that I was on Alpha Centauri.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It took about four
to five seconds

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:90%
to get through this portal.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did you know that?

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: I just knew.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, when we got
there, I got off the--

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:84%
out of the craft,
walked up the beach.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
There are about 200
of these blue beings.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was on Alpha Centauri.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard of that.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:84%
I knew that these
beings were Lyran.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:90%
I knew about their, like--

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:90%
the foods that they were eating.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
They had these shades, like
sunglasses that they could just

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.815 align:middle line:84%
materialize over their face and
disappear into their bodies.

00:06:46.815 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I knew how long they
were pregnant for.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Just, things were just like--

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.243 align:middle line:90%
I just knew them.

00:06:52.243 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I knew
them, but just-- information

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:90%
was coming.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And these Lyran
beings-- they hugged me.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that I was home.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And when they hugged
me, this level of

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
love that I experienced--
it just melted me.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's a level of
love that is so hard

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:90%
to come by here on this planet.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But they hugged me for a little
while, and then they let me go.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:90%
And they parted a pathway.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of them led me up
the beach through a jungle

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to this building that
was made of light.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I went into the building,
and there was this really

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:90%
ancient blue being.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:90%
And it was like--

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
it reminded me of me in like an
ancient chief from a native--

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
was not a dream.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: This
wasn't a dream, no.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
It was as-- for me,
it seemed as real

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
as me sitting in this chair,
talking to you right now.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So this being asked me to
kneel down on the floor.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I kneeled down on the floor, and
this orange download of light

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.013 align:middle line:84%
comes down into my crown full
of all of this fluid moving--

00:07:50.013 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beams on you.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: --geometry.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of paralyzed,
just downloading this geometry.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, after a
while, it stopped.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
it was a minute

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:90%
or whether it was six hours.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I've got no
recollection of time.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
But then two of these
beings picked me up

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
underneath my armpits
and frogmarched me back

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:90%
to the space pod.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.283 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: They
stuck me back inside.

00:08:09.283 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:90%
We flew back through the tunnel.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I went back into my meditation,
into my body in the garden.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And then nothing
else happened, and I

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:84%
was sat there then,
really wanting

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:90%
the next piece of the puzzle.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And about two years went passed.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
And then one day, I woke up.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that we had
to go back to England.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So after talking to the
missus and the kids, who

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
thought I was absolutely nuts
and crazy because we'd just

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:84%
started the new life
in New Zealand--

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.397 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: We ended up
going back to England.

00:08:34.397 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
seeing fairies

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and having these
interactions with angels

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:90%
and different beings.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.888 align:middle line:84%
And this being came
down and said to me,

00:08:42.888 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:84%
you need to write a book
called "Into the Light."

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.070 align:middle line:90%
So I ran home.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:90%
I wrote this book.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I
published it, I started

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.720 align:middle line:84%
seeing all the
geometrical code that

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
got downloaded in
the orange frequency

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:90%
when I was on Alpha Centauri.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying to
my guides, what am I

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:90%
supposed to do with this stuff?

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, you
need to meditate more.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So I started getting up
every day with my son Josh.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:84%
We were going to these
ancient mystery schools

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.998 align:middle line:84%
every single morning for
two hours for nine months.

00:09:07.998 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intense, Jerry.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: It was amazing.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.095 align:middle line:84%
And they were showing
us these scrolls.

00:09:12.095 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And on the scrolls
were the same codes

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
that I was seeing in the empty
space, the same codes that

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:90%
came in the orange downloads.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:90%
So all of this happens.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other thing
that happened--

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:84%
when I moved back from
New Zealand, I got

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.668 align:middle line:84%
arrested for conspiracy to
defraud the Bank of Scotland.

00:09:26.668 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They caught you.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: They
caught me, and also

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:90%
holding a false travel document.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at a
long, long prison sentence.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.335 align:middle line:84%
So I was on bail for two years,
going from the city of London

00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:90%
back to where I live.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:90%
They took my passport.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't allowed to travel.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So I said to the
universe, listen,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
if you get me off
this court case,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I promise you I'm going
to do this healing stuff.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Because all the time, they'd
given me all this knowledge,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:90%
all this information.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:90%
But I kept resisting it.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
All of my friends
were criminals,

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
so they looked at
me like I was crazy.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:90%
My family thought I was nuts.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So I kept kind of
resisting it, and I

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.410 align:middle line:84%
was getting the temptation
through large amounts of money

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:84%
to go back to my
criminal activities.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So to cut a long story
short, I went to court.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm stood in this
bulletproof dock.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And the judge walks out, and
he's got his two accomplices.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:90%
They're both females.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
The one to his
right and my left.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:90%
She had wings on her back.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:90%
I could see them.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: She looked at me.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:90%
She smiled, and she winked.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.423 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, no
way, in my mind.

00:10:28.423 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like, you
had an insider there.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.923 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, I'm
going to get off this.

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But my ego was still like,
no, no, no, no, no way.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But there was this kind
of feeling in my heart.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So the prosecution gave
their side of the story.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:84%
My solicitor gave my
side of the story.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the judge went
out and deliberated

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:90%
with the two ladies.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
They came back in,
like, 30 minutes later.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.177 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:10:49.177 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, she looked at me, and
she winked and smiled again.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And the judge turned
to me and said,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.623 align:middle line:84%
we can see you're a
changed man, Mr. Sargeant.

00:10:55.623 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give you
a one-year conditional

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:90%
discharge--

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.388 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: --and an
80 pounds court fee.

00:11:00.388 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:90%
You're free to go.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, yes, that's
it, Star Magic Healing.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:90%
I've got no choice now.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.260 align:middle line:90%
So that was it.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
What then happened is the
blue being that took me

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
in the spacecraft
came to see me again

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.222 align:middle line:84%
and told me that I needed to
build these healing centers.

00:11:15.222 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, if I build
them, who's going to run them?

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, you need
to train people.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:90%
So I ran home.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I designed this
training program.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:90%
I put it up online.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:90%
And this was 2017.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
The class just filled
up straight away.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.155 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: And
since then, we've

00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
trained thousands of people
in more than 55 countries.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:84%
We're in the process of
creating our first healing

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:84%
center in Transylvania at
the moment and in Romania.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And everything's
just-- just flowing,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like I'm just
following the breadcrumbs.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.788 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just keep following.

00:11:46.788 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, people who
attend your events

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:84%
have this profound
physical healing situation.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's watch these
healings, and Jerry describes

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:90%
on tape what's going on.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: With the healings,
at the back of the neck,

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
you've got something
called God's Mouth.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is
we run frequency

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:90%
in through God's Mouth.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.983 align:middle line:84%
It goes up into
the pineal gland.

00:12:07.983 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's happening
to her right there, Jerry?

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: She's having
a biological upgrade.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, once the frequency
hits the pineal gland,

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
it downloads energy, codes into
every single cell in the body.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And it wipes out
old programming.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And people start to cry.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.700 align:middle line:90%
They bend.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:90%
They twist.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:90%
They shake.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And their bodies just have
these crazy experiences.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And people just take
their hearing aids out.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
People just get up from
wheelchairs and walk.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.020 align:middle line:90%
People's eyesights come back.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.493 align:middle line:84%
They start to manifest
beautiful relationships.

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Mental, physical,
emotional, spiritual things

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:90%
just take place.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:90%
It's very fast.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It's very effective, and it's
something we train people in.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Like, anyone can do this stuff.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:84%
People sometimes look at
me and think, oh, you've

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:90%
got this special gift.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I
mean, look at me.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I've come from a life of crime
to be able to do in this.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do it.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies are shaken,
and the old program--

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that energy
coming from you to them?

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that why they're shaking?

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.015 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: The energy
is not coming from me.

00:13:08.015 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at-- like,
you're a physical being.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm a physical being.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.680 align:middle line:90%
This floor is physical.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But your physical being
is actually computer code.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:90%
This floor is computer code.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.550 align:middle line:84%
The pair of shoes on my
feet are computer code.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Trees are computer code.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you're able to tap
into the code that is operating

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:84%
the physical vessel, whether
it's a tree or a human,

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.910 align:middle line:84%
you can change the code in
the back end of someone's

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:90%
biological computer.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So if someone has liver
cancer, for example that's

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
because they're
experiencing guilt.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Or they're experiencing
anger somewhere

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.455 align:middle line:90%
in the quantum fields.

00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:44.930 align:middle line:84%
We're souls having
this human experience.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we're having
multiple experiences.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're able to find those
experiences, where the soul has

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
experienced guilt
or anger that's

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
creating the cancer in
the liver, for example.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And we can change the
code in the back end

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:90%
of someone's computer.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Once we change the code in the
back end of someone's computer,

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:90%
the frequency runs.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.440 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't come from us.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the code
in the empty space.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
caused them to be spastic

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well,
it's not like spastic.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows what's going on.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.293 align:middle line:90%
They're not hypnotized.

00:14:17.293 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They're fully aware
of their experience.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, those people
were aware of what was going on?

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Fully aware
of their experience.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why was the guy crying?

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Because he's having
such a deep emotional release.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, last week, not last
week, the week before, we

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:90%
were in New York.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was the second
day of our group healing,

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and we'd just done this
really powerful breath work.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And I just burst out crying
for about 40 minutes.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:90%
The love that I--

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I did, yeah, the
love that I felt in my body

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:90%
was unbelievable.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
It was the love that I felt
when I went to Alpha Centauri

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:90%
and hugged these Lyrans.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I was just so emotional,
so full of love.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
beautiful experience.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And when people have
these biological upgrades,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.140 align:middle line:90%
sometimes they scream.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they cry.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they laugh.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The body is just
releasing what it

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
needs to release so the old
programming can dissolve,

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and the new programming
can come in.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the physical symptoms
start to either disappear,

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
or new physical things manifest,
whether it's abundance,

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:84%
whether it's beautiful
relationships,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:90%
business opportunities.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jerry,
what is Deraquay?

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Deraquay
is the blue being

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.495 align:middle line:84%
that came to pick me
up in the spacecraft.

00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was his name?

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: That's
his name, Deraquay.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:84%
For those of you that are
watching this that can see,

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
you'll see him here
to my right-hand side.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:90%
To my left-hand side is Deron.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Deron and Deraquay
are always with me.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Deron is actually me.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a Lyran version of me
that's always with me 24/7.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:90%
And Deraquay is always here.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:90%
They guide me all the time.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you see them now?

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they look like?

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well, Deraquay
is taller than Deron.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Deraquay is about
almost 7 foot tall.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 7 foot?

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: About 7 foot, yeah.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Deron's smaller.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
He's about just under
6 and 1/2 foot tall.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:90%
They're both blue.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:90%
They're androgynous beings.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:90%
They've got no sexual organs.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:84%
They don't really wear
any kind of clothes.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It looks like they're
naked, but they

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
have this powerful
energetic template

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
around their body, which is a
diamondy, platinumy, crystal

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:90%
white color.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are they
with you so often?

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: They've been with
me since 2012, all the time,

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.360 align:middle line:84%
just looking after me,
guiding me, advising me.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I always ask them
questions about everything

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:90%
that I'm doing.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they help you?

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: All the time.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
is the significance

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:90%
of the orange and blue dots?

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And what are they to you?

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So the
orange and blue dots

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
were what Deraquay showed
me when he told me that I

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:90%
had to build healing centers.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I always sat meditating on a
hill, looking out over the town

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:90%
that I live on.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And the whole town
just disappeared.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the Christ
consciousness grid

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, this
huge icosahedron,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
which is like a
20-sided shape made out

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:90%
of equilateral triangles.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And around this grid structure
were these orange and blue

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:90%
dots.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: And these
orange and blue dots

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:90%
were the healing centers.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
They were showing
me where I needed

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:11.670 align:middle line:90%
to build them, et cetera.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking
of healing centers,

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:13.922 align:middle line:90%
let's take a look at them.

00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
And then describe for us, Jerry,
what we're looking at here.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So this
is the healing center

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
building in Transylvania,

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.200 align:middle line:84%
a place called
Harghita in Romania.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's beautiful.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: It's on 15 acres.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.330 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have
accommodation for a hundred

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:90%
people plus another 13 houses.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:84%
There's restaurants, horse
healing, healing chambers.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be gym
facilities, everything

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that you need to go and
submerge in the forest.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
That's a restaurant built
out of sacred geometry.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
like little cities.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, I
mean, the architects

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that were working
with-- they actually

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:90%
downloaded these buildings.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're
actually-- the reason

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:84%
that it was so amazing for
me, because the frequency

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.010 align:middle line:84%
in these buildings is the
same frequency that we use

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:90%
in our Healing in Star Magic.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And that little white sphere?

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: That's an
extraterrestrial meeting hub.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:84%
It's going to carry the right
frequency for extraterrestrials

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
to be here on Earth
and for us to actually

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.300 align:middle line:90%
have meetings with them.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
happens for the people who

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.655 align:middle line:90%
come to these centers?

00:18:18.655 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So people are
going to come to these centers.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
They can partake
in our trainings.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
We do five and
seven-day trainings.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.888 align:middle line:84%
We've got three
levels of training.

00:18:27.888 --> 00:18:29.097 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can stay there?

00:18:29.097 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah,
they can stay there.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:90%
They can do the trainings.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:84%
They can do plant medicine,
ayahuasca, psilocybin.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.170 align:middle line:84%
They can just come
for horse healing.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
They can come for one-on-one
individual healing.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
People can come
and do workshops.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.215 align:middle line:84%
We've got so many different
workshops that we run.

00:18:47.215 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many centers do you
have now, and what's the plan?

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So the
plan is to build 13.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
the first one we just--

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the planet?

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.803 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: All over
the planet, yeah.

00:18:55.803 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:90%
We've been buying up the land.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And this first one in
Transylvania, Romania,

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the
first flagship.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
home of Dracula.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: The home of Dracula.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:84%
It's literally maybe 10 or 15
miles from Dracula's castle,

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.773 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty cool.

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is cool.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
We're in the process of getting
the last bit of planning

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:90%
permission at the moment.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that goes
through, we'll break ground.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And we'll start building.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people can these centers

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.752 align:middle line:90%
hold at any one time?

00:19:20.752 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So it will be
accommodation for a hundred

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:90%
people, this first one.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the land
that we've built--

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
that we've bought in Madeira,
which is the next one--

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.270 align:middle line:84%
it's an island,
part of Portugal.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.420 align:middle line:84%
That's going to have
accommodation for a lot more.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
The one that we've got the
land that we've bought in Wales

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.543 align:middle line:90%
is going to be smaller.

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:84%
They're all going
to be different.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:90%
It just depends.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we're--

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going to
have different people run

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:90%
these for you?

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.078 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:19:43.078 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:84%
We've trained thousands of
people in preparation for this.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
the goal, Jerry?

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:84%
What's the goal for the people
who attend these events?

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So the goal for
us is to expand consciousness

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, to
raise the frequency,

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity remember who
they truly are, that they're

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:84%
these powerful, divine,
sovereign beings

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
that are Galactic in nature
here in these human bodies.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we're
connected by love.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And when people come to our
group healings or our workshops

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:84%
or our trainings, we
are empowering them

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:90%
to the nth degree.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
They leave our trainings and
our workshops physically,

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, mentally healed.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And they step into
their power, and they

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
can walk out into this reality
field like lions and lionesses.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
conditions do you heal, Jerry?

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well, I
mean, we've had people--

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:84%
last week, in our
Calgary workshop,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.960 align:middle line:84%
we had a lady that had
not walked for 10 years.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.690 align:middle line:84%
She got up out of
her wheelchair,

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and she walked on the first
day of the group healing.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: The second
day of the group healing,

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:84%
she walked from the car
100 meters into the hotel,

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.502 align:middle line:84%
up the lift, all the
way down the corridor.

00:20:58.502 --> 00:20:59.752 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they saying?

00:20:59.752 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Are they in shock?

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well, I mean,
all these video testimonials

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
are on our website, on
starmagichealing.com

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:90%
for people to go and look at.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:90%
People are just crying.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.550 align:middle line:90%
They're happy.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The emotional response is
different for different people.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
For me, this is why we get
up every morning and do it.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
We've had people take
their hearing aids out.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:84%
We've had all sorts
of-- you name it,

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.540 align:middle line:84%
brain tumors that have
been in people's heads.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Then doctors said, you'll
be dead in eight weeks.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're still alive and
breathing four years later

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:90%
with no brain tumor.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how is this possible?

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the tumor probably
shrinks to nothing, right?

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well, it
shrinks and disappears.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's not there at all.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And we've got-- we've got
doctor's scans to prove this.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But who's doing it?

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Are you doing it to them, or
are they doing it to themselves?

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So one
thing I want to say,

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:84%
this is what I share with
everybody on our trainings.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I've never healed
anyone in my life.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But what I do is
create an environment

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.480 align:middle line:90%
so they can self-heal.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that says
they're a healer

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and that they can heal you is
full of absolute you know what.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do with
the right frequency,

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:84%
under the right
conditions, if you

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
play with the code in
the back end of someone's

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:90%
biological computer correctly--

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tap into it.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.382 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Their
body can self-heal.

00:22:08.382 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is
create an environment

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:84%
so these human
beings can self-heal.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all mathematics.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:90%
It's all geometrical code.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And you've got a lot of
healing modalities, like Reiki

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and quantum healing,
and bioenergy healing.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.020 align:middle line:90%
They're old-school.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Star Magic is the new school.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:84%
We're showing fast, rapid,
effective healing that lasts,

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's all done by acting
like a computer programmer.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The feedback
you get from these events

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:90%
must be astounding.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Amazing.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely phenomenal.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.827 align:middle line:10%
It's why we get up every
morning and go again.

00:22:42.827 --> 00:22:44.410 align:middle line:10%
For me, when I wake
up in the morning,

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:48.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm like a rocket ship
waiting to leave a NASA Space

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:10%
Station for the moon because
I'm so pumped and excited

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.360 align:middle line:10%
about life.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.777 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of
your clients have

00:22:52.777 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:84%
talked about how
you and Star Magic

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:84%
have helped them change
their life and heal.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.360 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: I came with a
36-degree curve in my spine

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:10%
that I've had since I was
about 13, so that's 25 years.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.780 align:middle line:10%
That curve has
caused intense pain.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:10%
I've had multiple hip surgeries
because my entire body has

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:10%
been out of balance.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know if
it's just the physical

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:10%
or if it's the metaphysical, but
both healings that took place

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:10%
were so profound.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.940 align:middle line:10%
Now it is completely straight.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:10%
I can actually breathe
[BREATHES IN DEEPLY] and fill

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:10%
my lungs so full
with air that it's--

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, parts of my lungs
that never filled with air

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:10%
are getting oxygen.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Look what
happened yesterday.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.560 align:middle line:90%
I walked.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:90%
I got up.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I've been not able
to walk properly

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:84%
for about 10 or 12 years and
not be able to ever get off

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:90%
the ground for 20 years.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And when
I came, I was wearing

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:90%
a hearing aid for my hearing.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But after I've gone
through the training,

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.885 align:middle line:84%
I don't need a
hearing aid anymore.

00:24:00.885 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I came to
Jerry's group healing session

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:90%
yesterday.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.330 align:middle line:84%
First thing I experienced
during the workshop

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and before it even ended,
my eyesight improved.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:90%
I normally have blurry vision.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I couldn't
see items or people

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:90%
who are very far.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But yesterday, I could sharply
see the smallest detail

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.205 align:middle line:90%
at the furthest distance.

00:24:23.205 --> 00:24:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
taken sleeping

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
medication for eight-plus
years consistently.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And after the group healing,
I had the best night's sleep.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: The right
half of my face--

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
it was really tense, so the
muscles were really tense.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And it did hurt me so much.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced quite
intense headaches.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:90%
And Jerry actually did fix it.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
He healed it somehow [CHUCKLES]
literally in 20 seconds,

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:84%
which was absolutely
unbelievable.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:90%
My name is Ella.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't walk for five
years without help.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:90%
I can't even describe it.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I was shaking all the time
because I didn't expect that.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.855 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, when
I start walking again,

00:25:13.855 --> 00:25:18.440 align:middle line:90%
a very exciting experience.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jerry, what does
mainstream medicine say

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.252 align:middle line:90%
after the fact?

00:25:22.252 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well,
it's interesting.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, back in 2018, I was
arrested for healing people

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:90%
with cancer.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through
another court case.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
leave you alone.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.185 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: They don't
leave me alone, brother.

00:25:32.185 --> 00:25:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh!

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:90%
But it was interesting.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I hired a private detective to
find out who funded the case,

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and it was a cancer charity
that funded the case.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to court,
my kids-- they came with me.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:90%
I was in New York at the time.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.720 align:middle line:90%
I was in New York.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I was at the Conscious
Life Expo speaking.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I flew back to
London, landed at 5:00

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:84%
in the morning with
my two children,

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and went straight to court.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And my kids had to wait outside
because they were under 16.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I went in
and the judge--

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I had over a
hundred testimonials

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.213 align:middle line:84%
of people that
had written that--

00:26:04.213 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That had been
influenced and changed.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.302 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah,
healed through my work.

00:26:08.302 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And the judge looked
at me, and she

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.120 align:middle line:84%
said, there's nothing more
than I'd love, Mr. Sargeant,

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
to lock you up and
throw away the key.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:90%
But my hands are tied.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So because you've got
two children, I can't.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let you go, but I'm
going to fine you 6,000 pounds.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.652 align:middle line:90%
So they fined me 6,000 pounds.

00:26:24.652 --> 00:26:26.610 align:middle line:84%
They didn't lock me up
because of the children.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:27.652 align:middle line:90%
I had to look after them.

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:30.150 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they don't like
this stuff that we're doing.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:90%
But I saw it as a positive.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:84%
I thought, if they're
coming after me for this,

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.353 align:middle line:90%
I must be doing something right.

00:26:34.353 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So this inspired me to do more,
just to get out there and help

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:90%
more people.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, clearly that
woman's spine straightened out.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: We've had
so many of those spines.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to have
someone with a-- like,

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
we've had people
with kyphoscoliosis,

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:84%
which is a twisted
spine and a bent spine.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And they straighten back up
in 20 minutes, 15 minutes,

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.412 align:middle line:90%
30 minutes.

00:26:56.412 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are you
feeling when you're there

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:90%
with the individual, anything?

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I just
feel so plugged in.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
One thing that the Lyrans
have taught me is to stay

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.680 align:middle line:84%
plugged into to the
electrical energy of the stars

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and the magnetic
frequency of the Earth.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm running those frequencies
through my body all the time.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you're plugged
in and you're in the zone,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:84%
everything is just
so fluid and natural.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just know everything
that's happening in the space.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.233 align:middle line:84%
If someone's got a
problem, I'm there.

00:27:25.233 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And I know where to
touch on their body.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I know which piece
of code to rearrange.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you're
plugged into the universe.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
part of the universe.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:90%
You're part of the mathematics.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of 10
people who may attend

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
one of these sessions, 10
people, how many walk away

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:90%
feeling better?

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Most of them.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah,
pretty much all of them.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's going to have
an amazing experience come

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:90%
into our group healing sessions.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.805 align:middle line:90%
The frequency is so high.

00:27:52.805 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:84%
When you walk in through
the door and you do the work

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and you walk out, you're
never going to be the same.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I say to everybody that comes
into our healing session,

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.580 align:middle line:90%
are you prepared to die?

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Because we take
them so far, so deep

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:84%
into a whole different
frequency band

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.090 align:middle line:90%
that everything rearranges.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And when they come out the
other side, they're transformed.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that why
they're so emotional?

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Partly, yes,
because of the release.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.950 align:middle line:90%
The release--

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.062 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've been sick
for probably half their life.

00:28:22.062 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a
sudden, they're better.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.062 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Yeah, just imagine.

00:28:25.062 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:90%
The last lady, Ella--

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:84%
this was in Miami, like,
three or four weeks ago.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.240 align:middle line:90%
She had multiple sclerosis.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors had
said to her, you're

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:90%
never going to walk again.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a downhill slide.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.080 align:middle line:84%
From now on, everything's
going to deteriorate.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, the second day
of the group healing,

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
she stands up from
her wheelchair.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.037 align:middle line:84%
She actually walked 40
meters to the toilet--

00:28:46.037 --> 00:28:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unheard of.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: --took
her knickers down

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and her trousers, went to the
toilet, pulled them back up,

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and walked back in
again, all on her own.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was she in shock?

00:28:54.445 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: She was just elated.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:90%
She was absolutely elated.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.282 align:middle line:84%
She was smiling from
ear to ear, one side

00:29:00.282 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:90%
of the universe to the other.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once they
leave the sessions,

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:90%
are they permanently fixed?

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Or do they have to
tune themselves up?

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well, I
always say to everybody,

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.230 align:middle line:90%
this is a lifestyle.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:90%
You have to live the lifestyle.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to remain
a high vibrational being,

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:84%
you've got to keep
doing the work.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:90%
So keep doing your meditation.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.222 align:middle line:84%
Keep doing your exercise, your
intermittent fasting, cold--

00:29:22.222 --> 00:29:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stay tuned up.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: --showers.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole recipe to
staying on a high frequency.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And through the
Star Magic Tribe,

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:90%
we share this with everybody.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.393 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jerry, you
mentioned that you

00:29:31.393 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of employees
that you work at and train.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.450 align:middle line:90%
How do you train them?

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Well,
we've got employees.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:84%
There's about 35
people in the team

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that kind of work in making
this whole spaceship fly.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But we've trained
thousands of people

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to be Facilitators, so
they're two different things.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But the Facilitators-- we have
a five-day Level 1 training.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.170 align:middle line:84%
We've got one coming up in
Sedona soon, where they come.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And they learn
everything they need

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:84%
to heal another human
being, to heal themselves,

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:90%
and to heal groups of people.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got Level 2 training,
which is about light body work.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:90%
It's about planetary grid work.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It's about the stargates and the
multidimensional architecture

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:84%
around everybody's
physical body.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And then Level 3 training is
how to take groups of people

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.530 align:middle line:84%
on Galactic journeys
through portals and vortexes

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.450 align:middle line:90%
safely and bring them back home.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is
helping the individual?

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Are they doing it themselves, or
are they tapping into something

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:26.690 align:middle line:90%
out there?

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: So we teach them
how to play with the code.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the word
"teach" is the wrong word.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.920 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we
help them remember

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:90%
how to play with the code.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Because what I say to everybody,
I can't teach you anything.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody
knows everything.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.150 align:middle line:84%
They've just simply
forgotten it.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing is
help, helping human beings

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.790 align:middle line:84%
wake up those innate abilities
that are inside their DNA code.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.292 align:middle line:84%
And all of the information
rises to the surface,

00:30:52.292 --> 00:30:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and they remember
this information.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.452 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're helping the
individual to heal themselves.

00:30:56.452 --> 00:30:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But do they
have to believe in this?

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I say to everybody
to believe in nothing.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Believing is dangerous.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Belief systems are based
on thought processes.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.527 align:middle line:90%
They don't exist.

00:31:07.527 --> 00:31:09.860 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a thought and
you trace that thought back

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.208 align:middle line:84%
to its origin, it comes
from another thought

00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:13.250 align:middle line:90%
and then another thought.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it comes back to
time, distance, or measurement.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Time, distance, and measurement
in the quantum field

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:90%
don't exist.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, all belief
systems are a load of BS.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is
we show people how

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to remember that
internal knowing

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:90%
so they know themselves.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Knowing trumps believing
every single time.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So we help people know who
they are, which is powerful,

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:41.090 align:middle line:84%
supersonic superhumans, Galactic
titans here on this Earth plane

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:45.710 align:middle line:84%
to recode humanity and wake up
their angelic superhuman DNA

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:90%
template.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is our existence
on good-old planet Earth?

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.827 align:middle line:90%
What are we here for?

00:31:50.827 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: We're here for
many different reasons.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.830 align:middle line:84%
It depends which
perspective you look at.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ultimately, we're
guardians of the stargates.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:84%
There's 12 primary
stargates on planet Earth.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got 12
secondary stargates,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and there's other
stargates, too.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we do as a humanity
is we control the stargates.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.850 align:middle line:84%
We've got crystal keys and
codes in our energetic template,

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.070 align:middle line:84%
which enables the
stargates to stay open

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.047 align:middle line:84%
and for us to travel backwards
and forwards through them.

00:32:16.047 --> 00:32:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain these codes
that you talk about, Jerry.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: So these codes--

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:90%
they're mathematical equations.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to travel
through a stargate,

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:90%
then you have to be--

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tuned in.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Tuned in to that
stargate through the inner keys

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.020 align:middle line:90%
and codes.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it like a frequency?

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: They're
like a frequency.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.050 align:middle line:90%
They're geometry.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:84%
They're geometrical patterns,
and they have to all align

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
to be able to travel
backwards and forwards.

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing when
we're doing our healing.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.940 align:middle line:84%
The mathematical code in
someone's physical body,

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:84%
or the back end of
their physical body,

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.870 align:middle line:84%
their biological computer
has to be in alignment.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they're going to
suffer from cancer or eyesight

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:84%
issues or fibromyalgia
or trigeminal neuralgia.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But you change the
coding in the fabric--

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.400 align:middle line:90%
everything just heals.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
change your DNA?

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:05.925 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:33:05.925 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Most people are operating at
a very limited DNA blueprint.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, originally, if you go
back 560-plus million years ago,

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
we were angelic humanoids
with six digits on each hand.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.340 align:middle line:84%
We were living on
a planet called

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Tara in the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Now we're living
on a planet called

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Earth, very limited
beings with a two,

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.860 align:middle line:84%
three, maybe four
strand template.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But we have the
capacity to go to 12.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And through frequency,
lights, vibration, codes,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.660 align:middle line:84%
we can activate more of our
superhuman potential, which

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.870 align:middle line:84%
is encoded in our DNA, in
our original blueprint.

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's inside every
single human being.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So whenever people are coming
into our healing sessions,

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.680 align:middle line:84%
they come into our
trainings, they're

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:84%
listening to our meditation
library on our website,

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.920 align:middle line:84%
they're being activated
left, right, and center.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't you feel
better about yourself

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.680 align:middle line:84%
doing what you're doing now, as
opposed to what you used to do?

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.080 align:middle line:90%
I love what I'm doing now.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I get to meet cool
people like you.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:90%
I get to travel the world.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.784 align:middle line:84%
And I get to see the
transformation in every--

00:34:09.784 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:84%
in other people
every single day.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
think you'd be doing this?

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Never.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:84%
If you'd have told me,
going back 15 years ago,

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
that I'd be sat here
having a conversation

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.170 align:middle line:90%
about this kind of stuff--

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On a
television program.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.135 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: --you're crazy.

00:34:21.135 --> 00:34:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I'd have thought,
where's the guy in the straight

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.490 align:middle line:90%
jacket coming to--

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:90%
where was the guy--

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
change your life?

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: It's not been easy.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.659 align:middle line:90%
Like, you know--

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:32.909 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has been tempting
to go back to the old life?

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:34.409 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Every
single human being

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:90%
has dark and light in them.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.909 align:middle line:84%
The Devil and God are inside
every single human being.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On our shoulders.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: On our
shoulders, inside of us.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to do
is balance both of them.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.402 align:middle line:84%
People that are running
into the light--

00:34:48.402 --> 00:34:49.860 align:middle line:84%
they're never going
to be powerful.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:84%
People that are
playing in the darkness

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:90%
are never going to be powerful.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:84%
If you really want
to be powerful,

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.860 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get all of the
darkness and all of the light,

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.070 align:middle line:84%
bring it into wholeness and
zero point it in your heart.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
the balance is.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.860 align:middle line:84%
The balance and the equilibrium
gives you your power.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, it's about
when the Devil is speaking,

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.270 align:middle line:84%
reining that back in
and bringing it back

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.260 align:middle line:90%
into the zero point.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And every now and again,
you sway and you yo-yo.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But you just make choices
to come back to the center.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.555 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's tempted.

00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
would you say today

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:26.780 align:middle line:84%
to those who you may
have hurt in your life

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and your career who are
watching you right now?

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I would
say, I love you.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:90%
We're sisters.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.560 align:middle line:90%
We're brothers.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.200 align:middle line:84%
We've all got innate
potential inside of us.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.390 align:middle line:90%
And take that step.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Be brave and journey
into your heart.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Your heart is your life compass.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It will always lead you in
the direction of your dreams,

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.415 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to
be brave enough

00:35:47.415 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:84%
to dive in because your
heart will lead you

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.270 align:middle line:90%
on a crazy journey.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you follow it, and you're
brave enough to follow it,

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and you overcome the challenges
along the way, I guarantee you,

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.180 align:middle line:84%
you're just going
to step into a more

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:04.530 align:middle line:84%
formidable, powerful, upgraded
superhuman version of yourself.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:90%
And life's going to be amazing.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Some people on this
planet are in a mess.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.585 align:middle line:84%
Some people on this planet
are in an amazing place.

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:11.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:11.385 --> 00:36:13.802 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: There's different
frequency bands playing out,

00:36:13.802 --> 00:36:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and we get to choose.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Has star?

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Magic changed your life?

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, in ways
that I could just--

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm just so grateful, George.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.462 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where would you like to
see Jerry in the next 10 years.

00:36:27.462 --> 00:36:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I just want to
build out these healing centers.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.590 align:middle line:84%
The reason that I want to
build out these healing centers

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.540 align:middle line:84%
is because, number
one, they're going

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.190 align:middle line:84%
to be a place for
people to come and heal.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.830 align:middle line:84%
But the main reason
for me is the children.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.500 align:middle line:84%
There are so many incredible
children coming down

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.850 align:middle line:84%
from the stars right now, and
they have amazing abilities.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't got
a safe playground.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.570 align:middle line:84%
They haven't got
a place where they

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:52.470 align:middle line:90%
can express these abilities.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.260 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
the UK, if you get

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.900 align:middle line:84%
children that express these
kind of abilities in school,

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:90%
they get taken from school.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.560 align:middle line:84%
They get put into
these special programs.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:84%
They get demonized, sent
back to their parents,

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:90%
a shadow of their former self.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.660 align:middle line:84%
We can take these children
into these healing centers,

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and they can have a
beautiful playground

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.600 align:middle line:84%
to express their
multidimensional faculties,

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.560 align:middle line:84%
telekinesis,
teleportation, telepathy,

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.680 align:middle line:84%
all of these abilities that are
inside every single one of us.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:84%
What I truly feel is
that in a few years,

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.463 align:middle line:84%
the children are going to
be running this planet.

00:37:26.463 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And we as adults are going to
be sitting in the classrooms

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:84%
taking advice from the
children because they're

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.420 align:middle line:90%
the ones that truly know.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.520 align:middle line:84%
They're the gifted ones
that are coming down

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:90%
to help us remember--

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're our future.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:36.953 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: --fully.

00:37:36.953 --> 00:37:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you say
to a child who seems lost?

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: That depends
on how the child is lost.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, before I
can see anything,

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to try
and connect with them.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try and
connect with them

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.480 align:middle line:90%
and allow them to feel my love.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, by allowing
them to feel my love,

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.860 align:middle line:84%
there can be some
level of trust.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And once we get to a
level where there's trust,

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:84%
then hopefully I can guide
them in a certain direction.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And whether they're
a child or an adult,

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say the same
thing, that you're powerful.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Don't let anyone ever tell
you that you're strange

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.780 align:middle line:84%
or you're weird or
that you're useless.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.700 align:middle line:84%
You know that you have innate
abilities inside of you.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You know that you
have the ability

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to roam these earthly
planes, to blaze a new trail,

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.740 align:middle line:84%
to carve your own path,
to play the game of life

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.500 align:middle line:84%
by your own rules,
and to not bow down

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:84%
to society's rules
and regulations.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:90%
You came here to have fun.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.810 align:middle line:90%
You came here to be playful.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.510 align:middle line:84%
You came here to enjoy
this human experience.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.220 align:middle line:90%
So get out there and enjoy it.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Be crazy.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Do what you want.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Let your light shine.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Don't let anyone
stamp on your sparkle.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jerry, when's
the last time you cried?

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: About a
week ago in New York.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.073 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Two weeks ago.

00:38:54.073 --> 00:38:56.680 align:middle line:84%
We were doing breath work on
the second day of our group

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I put this music
track on afterwards,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and everyone was just there
with their hearts open.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And the level of the
love in the room--

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.190 align:middle line:84%
my heart just went
[MIMICS EXPLOSION]..

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And I just cried
like a little baby.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
the tears came--

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.460 align:middle line:90%
I was sobbing.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I was walking around,
working on people.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:90%
I was on my knees, just like--

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I had so much love flowing out
of me, into me, through me,

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.890 align:middle line:90%
it was indescribable, George.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:24.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want it to end.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I felt so full, so full of
love that I didn't need food.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I didn't need people.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:32.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't need anything.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I could have lived off
this love for forever

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:90%
and just being so content.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would the Jerry
Sargeant 10 years ago

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.820 align:middle line:90%
have cried?

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: No.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.865 align:middle line:90%
He bottled it all up.

00:39:43.865 --> 00:39:46.580 align:middle line:84%
He bottled it all up,
and he contained it all.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:51.980 align:middle line:10%
And he just put on a brave face,
and he was a false human being.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.500 align:middle line:10%
He was completely different
from the Jerry now.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you help just
one person, is it worth it?

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SARGEANT: Absolutely.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm here to help
a lot more than one.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God is
following you, isn't he?

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's helping
you along the way.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: I truly know
that we're all gods.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.560 align:middle line:90%
We're all gods.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.430 align:middle line:90%
We're all goddesses.

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:90%
God is a frequency.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:13.720 align:middle line:90%
God is love.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Love is God.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.630 align:middle line:90%
God is inside you.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.650 align:middle line:90%
God is inside me.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:18.030 align:middle line:90%
God is inside everything.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all energy.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we listen to our hearts
and just follow our life

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.300 align:middle line:84%
compass, God's
infinite intelligence,

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.910 align:middle line:84%
universal intelligence
source, whatever

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.860 align:middle line:84%
label you decide
a stick on it, is

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.870 align:middle line:84%
going to lead us in the
direction of our dreams.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.960 align:middle line:84%
It's going to unify humanity,
expand consciousness,

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and create a much better
playground on this world for us

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.800 align:middle line:84%
to be free and
sovereign and just

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:84%
be the alchemists
and the witches

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and the wizards and the
quantum architects that we are.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
the Star Magic website.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.640 align:middle line:10%
>>SARGEANT: So
Star Magic website

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.620 align:middle line:10%
is starmagichealing.com.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:10%
When you go to the website,
you can access information

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:10%
on infinity, which is
our monthly membership.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Inside that, you're going
to be able to experience

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.180 align:middle line:84%
light language,
transmissions, cosmic yoga

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:10.513 align:middle line:84%
videos, meditations, master
classes, weekly meditations.

00:41:10.513 --> 00:41:12.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole heap
of different tools.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.910 align:middle line:84%
You've got all of our
trainings, global meditations.

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:90%
There's loads of free content.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.055 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, go and check it
out, and connect with us.

00:41:19.055 --> 00:41:21.217 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep doing what
you're doing, Jerry.

00:41:21.217 --> 00:41:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SARGEANT: Thank
you so much, George.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.050 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure, brother.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:25.470 align:middle line:84%
