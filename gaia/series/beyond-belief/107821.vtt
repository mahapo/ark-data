00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I
think many people today

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to believe

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.706 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.706 --> 00:00:13.385 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.325 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:25.215 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: In this
edition of "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:10%
we're going to talk about
up there and maybe down

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:10%
here, extraterrestrial
presence, UFOs.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Chase Kloetzke's with us.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:84%
She's a UFO export, a
researcher, and noted author,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:90%
and one of my favorites.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Chase welcome to the program.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.876 align:middle line:84%
>>CHASE KLOETZKE: It's
so my pleasure, George.

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in investigating UFOs?

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: It really started
as simple as reading "Chariots

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.884 align:middle line:84%
of the Gods" by
Erich von Daniken--

00:00:57.884 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Love the guy!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Exactly--
way back in the '70s.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:10%
And I just couldn't get the
questions out of my mind.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:10%
It was the first time I'd
actually read something like

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:10%
that or even realized people
thought that thoroughly

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:10%
or questioned things,
such as biblical text.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And it blew me away.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And it really started
a quest of just trying

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:84%
to find out more
information along that line.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
1994 that I really

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
took on investigating
specifically UFOs full time.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened in
'94 to make you do that?

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I think I just found
the opportunity and time where

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I could put so much energy into
it, and I joined MUFON in 1996.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.914 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mutual UFO Network.

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:10%
And got the field
manual and took the test

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:10%
and became a field
investigator, which eventually

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:10%
led to Deputy Director of
Investigations and STAR

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:10%
team manager.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't redesigned the
whole program after Bigelow.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You enjoy this.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.126 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I love it.

00:01:58.126 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I love it.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced
that we're being visited?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And I believe UFOs
are real, and I

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
believe that they are
visiting Earth and interacting

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:90%
with humanity.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I also believe we have mountains
of evidence of this, however,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
the public and
scientists may not really

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
understand that because we're
not very good at presenting it

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:90%
correctly.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I must have been 18
or 19 years old in Detroit when

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:10%
the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek
came to Michigan to talk

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:10%
about the Dexter Michigan
case, which he coined

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:10%
the phrase, swamp gas,
and it haunted him

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:10%
for the rest of his career.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But I remember that
in-- at 19, I'm

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
working for a television station
in that city at that time,

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and we were still
talking about that.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Just an incredible case.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We're still
talking about that swamp gas

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's something
that comes up.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.350 align:middle line:84%
It still haunts you
Ufology to this day.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually
working a case.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I was in the swamps of Louisiana
looking for the Honey Island

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Swamp monster.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And the swamp gas, of course,
came up with some of the press

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.180 align:middle line:90%
and locals that were there.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And it just really
struck me that we

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
need to give our witnesses more
credibility and more credit.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
When you have these people
that were raised on the swamp,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:84%
they're fifth generation
there, I think they know--

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They know what
they're looking at.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.438 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely!

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
They know what swamp gas is,
and that's not what they saw.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hynek
switched eventually--

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
became a staunch believer in
extraterrestrial presence,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and I think until
the day he died,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.695 align:middle line:84%
he was mortified
by the fact that he

00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:90%
had called this swamp gas.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
The Midwest loaded with
incredible UFO cases,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:90%
including one in Ohio.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about that, and then we'll

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:90%
watch a video on that.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We have a lot of
cases that are reported to us.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And, as an independent
investigator at the time,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I literally prefer the cases
that have physical evidence.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
It's my forte-- is to
get out there and take

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
really complicated
and sensitive cases,

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
break them down, piece
them together so that they

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:90%
meet the burden of proof.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.210 align:middle line:84%
There's an admissibility
in our case studies,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
in our case files, that we
not only owe the witness,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:84%
but we owe the public and
the scientific community.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So this case presented physical
evidence, credible witnesses,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:84%
a lot of photographs,
and that's what we did.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:84%
We went out and got
all the testimonies,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
corroborated a lot of
what he was claiming

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and alleged, and
picked up the evidence.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And really, the main thing,
and the biggest thing

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
we're changing out
here right now,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
is taking the evidence to
professionals that have nothing

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:90%
to do with the UFO field.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
take a look at it, Chase.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:90%
This is a case from Ohio.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.829 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: This is
something you've called us in

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.727 align:middle line:10%
to redo for you.

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:55.810 align:middle line:10%
Can you give us a little
background on this first?

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, I'd have to
start with the night

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:10%
before that I found it.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:10%
I was at home by
myself, and my wife

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:10%
came driving up to the
front of the house.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the horn honking,
and my wife was yelling.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:10%
So I turned around
and went outside,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:10%
and she was pointing
up over the house

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:10%
and saying that there was a
large UFO above the house.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:10%
And by the time I got the rest
of the way out and looked up,

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:10%
it just disappeared.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:10%
And that started out the
night of strangeness.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:10%
Next morning, I got up
to go check the mail.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.410 align:middle line:10%
About a third of the
way up the driveway,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:10%
I heard a noise that sounded
like one of these old washing

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:10%
machines that was broken.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So I glanced up and looked at
where I was hearing it from.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.346 align:middle line:10%
And it was an object that
was about 100 yards long.

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:10%
I turned around and I
looked, and there you--

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:10%
the object wasn't that far from
the front door on the ground.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: This object?

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.369 align:middle line:10%
>>Yes.

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:08.624 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: OK.

00:06:08.624 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:10%
>>But it was
different, of course.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.020 align:middle line:10%
It was bigger this way.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.850 align:middle line:10%
Looked more like a
hatchet or something.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: Oh, OK.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:10%
>>And then on the
side here, there

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:10%
was a large piece of red
metal that stuck to this.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:10%
And when I went to touch
it, it was really hot.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:10%
It was too hot for me.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:10%
I immediately took it
to have it analyzed.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>We are simply going to
look at things objectively.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.980 align:middle line:84%
This piece of metal had a
very specific micro structure,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and it was because
of that, we could

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.580 align:middle line:84%
say it was engineered
to serve a function.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.192 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
believe that case?

00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I do.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And Bennie Foggin
has literally had

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.376 align:middle line:84%
a lifetime of high strangeness--
UFO visitations and encounters.

00:06:56.376 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:90%
His neighbors have seen it.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:90%
His family has seen this.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Many people are on the record.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a really great
case, but again, I

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.110 align:middle line:84%
think the problem with
some of these cases

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:90%
is how we present it.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
We have tons of evidence
in the UFO field,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.629 align:middle line:84%
but why is the mainstream
not understanding that?

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't pick it up.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Or the public?

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're not
interested in it.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
They laugh about
it in some cases.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.999 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: A lot of ridicule.

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We've got
some dear friends,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:10%
Lee Speigel at The Huffington
Post, he's into UFOs.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:10%
And he handles it in a very
newsy, no nonsense way.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
But we need more
people like that.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.039 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: We do.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
He keeps his
journalistic integrity

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:84%
while he's discussing the
UFO phenomenon, and that's

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
exactly what we need,
people that come in and give

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
the topic as much
research as they would

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
a robbery at the 7-Eleven, where
the reporters can quote data.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
This 7-Eleven has been
robbed seven times

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:90%
in the last four years,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: And if they just
did a little bit of homework,

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:90%
they'd see there was more to it.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we still getting
a lot of UFO cases, Chase?

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.651 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: We are.

00:08:01.651 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if it's because
the activities increased,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
or there's a lot
more in the skies.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Those drones are
killing us right now.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.427 align:middle line:90%
And the satellite technology--

00:08:11.427 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Screwing everything up.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, it's really
very difficult with the--

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
between the Patriot Act
and the high secrecy

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and all the technology
up there-- China's

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:84%
not going to tell us
their drones either.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So if just our military
complex and the things that

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.275 align:middle line:84%
are up there now
isn't enough, you

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with an
international phenomena that's

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:90%
also studying our skies.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very difficult
to get the information

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
or to effectively
investigate these.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.595 align:middle line:84%
But we're still
handling a lot of this.

00:08:41.595 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible
that, years ago, we

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:84%
were seeing tested drones
that people thought,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:90%
hey, there's a UFO.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think when people know
that you're a UFO investigator,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
they think we're out
here trying to prove

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:90%
the UFO phenomena is real.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
What we're trying to do is
find evidence and proofs

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:90%
of exactly what's going on.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth of it.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it is.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.873 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Exactly.

00:09:03.873 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's many times I'll
take a case-- or many of us

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:84%
will take a case, we get out
there, and we can't explain it.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.892 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: An unexplained
drone is a UFO, right?

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.397 align:middle line:84%
And with their being
unmanned, there's

00:09:16.397 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
a lot of issues they don't
have to deal with with humans

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
inside, so the
maneuverability is

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:84%
much like what we're seeing
on a lot of the video games.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:90%
They're extraordinary shapes.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
They're larger than
most people think.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I think when they
think of drones,

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
they imagine a
consumer level drone.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Some of these
drones are humongous.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When you are on
a case, outline for us

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.399 align:middle line:10%
exactly what you will do?

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Usually,
it depends on the case

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:90%
where the first priority is.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, it's the evidence.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's
witness testimony.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:90%
When I go--

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.758 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or both.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Usually when I go
in is to really--

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm a data collector
and a door kicker.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So I go in and I hear the
accounts of what they allege

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's my job to
collect everything

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I can, all the information,
all the data, and then

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
put it together and
see what we have

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and look for corroborating
the evidence.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
My goal, in every case that
I accept, is admissibility.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
We owe this to our witnesses--
I'll canvas a neighborhood.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I won't knock on a door
and say, hi, your neighbor,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.852 align:middle line:84%
Bob Johnson, down
the road saw a UFO,

00:10:24.852 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and I was wondering
if you saw anything--

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see it?

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
We're very professional
in how we handle things.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:90%
But I'll canvas a neighborhood.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I'll go to the
7-Eleven down and see

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
if they have video footage using
the same techniques as Homeland

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Security or a local
police department.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.487 align:middle line:84%
And most times, people
are cooperative,

00:10:43.487 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
especially when they know
what you're looking for.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:45.995 align:middle line:90%
They're curious.

00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I talk to Peter
Davenport a lot of my radio

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.405 align:middle line:10%
show--

00:10:48.405 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, he's awesome.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --from the National
UFO Reporting Center,

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:10%
so I know that UFO reports
continue to come in.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:10%
But what we seem
to be lacking are

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:10%
the old type of UFO
reports of landings,

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:10%
tripod marks, scorches.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:10%
Where are those cases?

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.759 align:middle line:10%
Why aren't they happening?

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I don't know
if they are slowing down

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
or if we're just not getting
as many of them anymore.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I still get several
of those every year

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:90%
and especially the landings.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I really haven't seen too
much of a decrease in that.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.714 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of it has to do
with the lack of investigators

00:11:27.714 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and boots on the
ground out in the field

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.852 align:middle line:84%
to go and get the soil samples
and get these to the labs.

00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or is
something happening?

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they're not landing
anymore for some reason.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Maybe.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.784 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
theory out there

00:11:38.784 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that UFO encounters
have advanced,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and they've become very
different each decade.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, in the '50s, it was
the contact-- the very friendly,

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:90%
wonderful contact.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the '60s, you
start an abduction

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.339 align:middle line:84%
and not so friendly
in the '60s and '70s.

00:11:58.339 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the '80s, you're

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
getting into hybrids and
babies and reproductive type

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And it almost seems like
there's a progression.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're still
trying to figure out

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:84%
if that has a lot to do
with social atmosphere

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:84%
of our culture that these
change or if there really

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.930 align:middle line:90%
is a different agenda.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:90%
But Ufology is huge.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different aspects.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:84%
You almost have to pick a
camp, like investigating,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:84%
researching, to
really come together

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:90%
for us to solve these questions.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:90%
It's very scientific.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think
with this era of smart phones

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that we'd capture more
video or pictures of these,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and we really aren't yet.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I think we do.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just there's so much
on the internet, which

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
makes it very
difficult for anybody

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.785 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out any news
about UFOs or any information.

00:12:51.785 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And real non-hoax ones.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Because there's so much.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Everybody, with
those smart phones,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.940 align:middle line:84%
may be not giving us
the reports as much

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:84%
as they used to because
now they can put it

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.589 align:middle line:90%
on Facebook and YouTube and--

00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instagram.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's where a
lot of our reports are going.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you're looking
for an investigator,

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:90%
we're not scanning those photos.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of my
favorite UFO cases

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
are the ones where
military members testify

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that craft shut down
military nuclear facilities.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, that's my
favorite case too, George.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which ones
have you looked at?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I've looked at
several of the military ones.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, my husband's
active duty as well,

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
so I have an audience
available to me.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So I hear a lot
of these accounts.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And some things I can say
and repeat and other things I

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:90%
can't.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.945 align:middle line:84%
But it's tucked away knowledge
that helps me in the next step.

00:13:48.945 --> 00:13:50.925 align:middle line:10%
Bob Salas, amazing.

00:13:50.925 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Great story.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, and
he is so credible.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:10%
And I think, with the--
Robert Salas, honestly,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:10%
he-- the vetting that they
go through for that kind

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.504 align:middle line:10%
of security clearance at
that time, for what he

00:14:02.504 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:10%
was dealing with, any
kind of nuclear weapons.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So his character is
beyond, beyond the normal.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.964 align:middle line:90%
He lives above that standard.

00:14:10.964 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I would say
he's beyond reproach.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you?

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.738 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:14:14.738 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And he was at a station,
probably on a duty,

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and some security
guards were up top,

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and things start
happening and things that

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:90%
are not supposed to happen.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:31.989 align:middle line:84%
And just like good
personnel of our military,

00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:90%
they start seeing things.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's hearing things from
topside about strange lights.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, they're not
thinking UFOs right away.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking what kind of
technology, what's coming in,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:84%
this is a national
security issue.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So as things are
being reported down,

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:84%
they are also
experiencing things

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that are not supposed to
happen as well in this area,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.687 align:middle line:84%
watching each nuclear missile
completely shut itself down.

00:14:57.687 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:90%
So of course--

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing story.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: It is.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: And I
just glossed over it,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:10%
but he's-- this is
one of the best,

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:10%
I believe because we
have trained observers.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
We have people that we know
are not prone to fantasy

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:90%
in any way, shape, or form.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.110 align:middle line:90%
These are people that can't lie.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, character is
above the standard.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:84%
We have corroborating
witnesses, and we

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.779 align:middle line:84%
have a phenomenon
that absolutely is not

00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:90%
supposed to happen, and it did.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I think
it's changed his life.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It certainly has.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think the behavior
of superiors after that--

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
this is a national
security issue,

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:84%
which would have
demanded a sitrep,

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
be completely put up
the chain, and yet,

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.564 align:middle line:84%
what happens after
that is really--

00:15:42.564 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's pretty
classified I would guess.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes,
it's a cover up.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at
the White Sands Missile Base

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:90%
case.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:90%
This is a great one.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:10%
>>The military person--
Villa was his name--

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:10%
said that it was a
weather balloon that they

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.480 align:middle line:10%
had to remove from there.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know I've seen
weather balloons before,

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and that was no weather balloon.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
That object came and
crashed right across--

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:90%
all the way across and came--

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: To stop right there.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.720 align:middle line:90%
So the path is a old road.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.160 align:middle line:84%
It did an S-turn and
landed right there

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:84%
where you see that dirt
that nothing is growing.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:84%
You see that dirt where
nothing is growing,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.299 align:middle line:90%
between the mesquite there?

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:90%
And it that landed there.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>That base has got something
to do-- because this is not

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:90%
the only object [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:90%
There's many, many of them.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I'll go ahead and
do that research for the soil

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:90%
and composition for Paula.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.555 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it has been tested.

00:16:57.555 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:90%
It would have to be.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably
online somewhere.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Why do you do that?

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: This is for any kind
of testing that we can double

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:84%
check to see if there's
any trace evidence

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:90%
of any other alloy.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there's also pollen.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Because it has been
out and contaminated

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:20.750 align:middle line:84%
through the elements, we
can, through these samples,

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.296 align:middle line:84%
dismiss that in
the real evidence.

00:17:23.296 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going to let
this dry, put it in our books.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are cases like that
happening all over the planet?

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We still get a
lot of the military cases.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And the phenomena seems
very, very interested

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:90%
in our conflicts, all conflicts.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.917 align:middle line:90%
And we see that--

00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they don't
get involved, Chase.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
That is something that
adds a lot of data.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
It tells us something about
this phenomena, doesn't it?

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot
of interaction.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
we're on our own,

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
either watch and see, wait

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
until they can come in,
but that's a discussion.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Good news is there's not
a whole lot of debate

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:84%
if intelligent beings from
other planets is real.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Even science is on board now.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's really debating heavily
if they're visiting our earth.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Really, the question today
is, what exactly do they want?

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:90%
And who are they?

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:18.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:18.535 --> 00:18:22.950 align:middle line:10%
If you listen to David Jacobs,
it's something very, very bad,

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:10%
and it's ongoing.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.065 align:middle line:84%
And let's hope he's wrong,
but I don't know if he is.

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I don't either.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:10%
And I saw a lot of
this when I was working

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:10%
with LA Marzulli looking for
the Nephilim and biblical

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:10%
proof of a genetic manipulation
here on-- with humanity.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And I gave LA's theory--
kicking and screaming, George,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:90%
because I was nuts and bolts.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I came from nuts and bolts, so--

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think he's right on.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: After a year,
it was very, very difficult.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I absolutely
do agree that he

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.110 align:middle line:84%
has as much evidence
in every way, shape,

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:84%
or form, physical, trace
evidence, documented evidence,

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:90%
as a nuts and bolts community.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.775 align:middle line:84%
And it's really coming
down to who are they.

00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:11.222 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
one or the other.

00:19:11.222 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's
looking like, and that's

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.450 align:middle line:90%
where the evidence points.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marzulli's theory is
that if you look at Genesis,

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
it is not fallen angels,
it is extraterrestrials.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.022 align:middle line:84%
Well, he believes--
I believe he thinks

00:19:27.022 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:84%
there's also intelligent
life on other planets.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But what's influencing
humans, what is actually

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
happening with us, is more
supernatural and cosmic,

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and it is a fallen
angel scenario.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we have the text
of them coming down, having

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.327 align:middle line:90%
relations with human women.

00:19:45.327 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:90%
They found them beautiful.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mated with them.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.538 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes and
had a race of giants.

00:19:49.538 --> 00:19:50.252 align:middle line:90%
And of course--

00:19:50.252 --> 00:19:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That got
wiped out in the flood.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, because
it polluted a genome.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this would
affect the birth of Jesus Christ

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:58.120 align:middle line:90%
as the Savior.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.453 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So let's wipe them out.

00:19:59.453 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Which is better
than a genocidal god

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:07.370 align:middle line:84%
that was just mad because we
were corrupt and bad humans.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And I really like that
better that it was more

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.240 align:middle line:90%
about a corrupted genome.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And it does make more
sense when you realize

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Noah wasn't perfect either.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:90%
But why was his family chosen?

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And LA's theory, as
well as many others--

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I refer to it as LA's
because I've worked so

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:90%
closely with him for so long.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But he believes that this
genetic manipulation continues

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.919 align:middle line:84%
to this day and that there
is a cosmic influence.

00:20:34.919 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:90%
So as a ufologist--

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.751 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He may be right.

00:20:36.751 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: So as a
ufologist-- exactly,

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:90%
George-- you come into this.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:90%
And you can't ignore evidence.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.500 align:middle line:84%
You can't ignore the path just
because you don't like it.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't like it.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I find
myself absolutely

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
finding more and more
reason to understand

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:90%
that he's most likely dead on.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And my other question
that I ask now

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:84%
is, does it have to
be one or the other?

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Does it have to be
they're coming here

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
from other planets on a full
tank of gas and a Red Bull?

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Or are they coming
here dimensional?

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Do we have supernatural beings?

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.149 align:middle line:90%
Can't it be everything?

00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wormholes.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.115 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:21:15.115 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:90%
This universe--

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
coming in that way.

00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --universe is huge.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean what are
the chances that we

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:84%
could have a supernatural
reality that some of these

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:90%
might transverse dimensions.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Angels would
transverse dimensions.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Why couldn't that be real?

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And we also have life
on other planets.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't like to
mix our sciences,

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and we don't like to
get out of our boxes.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But I have a feeling
that this phenomena

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:90%
is going to make us do both.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.218 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're with
Chase Kloetzke,

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
of course, noted
author and ufologist.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:84%
When I was a youngster,
I was a member

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:84%
of NICAP, National
Investigations

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Committee for Aerial Phenomena.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I had my little card, and I
thought I was a junior UFO

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.420 align:middle line:90%
investigator.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:90%
That organization went away.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:90%
It was very professional.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:84%
We had pilots, military
people involved.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.514 align:middle line:84%
MUFON has since
become the next NICAP.

00:22:06.514 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are part of MUFON.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.451 align:middle line:84%
What's it doing to try
to get the word out?

00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: MUFON--
for a long time,

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:90%
I belong to them for 18 years.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And actually, had an
incident where I left.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:90%
I left as a STAR team manager.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.029 align:middle line:84%
My resignation sent shockwaves
through the UFO community.

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That must
have bothered you.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.694 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: It did
because I love my job.

00:22:28.694 --> 00:22:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I loved being a
STAR team manager.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But I'm on the record
saying my integrity was not

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:90%
for sale or rent.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.084 align:middle line:90%
And I found my back in a corner.

00:22:37.084 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you care
to share the story?

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Well, it was when
we had our cases compromise

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:90%
with the STAR team.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.466 align:middle line:84%
And I caught a couple
people red-handed.

00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who's
the STAR team?

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.715 align:middle line:90%
What's the STAR team?

00:22:48.715 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: The STAR team
was the advanced unit

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:55.300 align:middle line:84%
that they had, and we handled
most of the complicated cases.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.200 align:middle line:84%
All CAT 3's belong
to the STAR team.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.382 align:middle line:84%
So any case that offers physical
evidence, trace evidence--

00:23:00.382 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The good ones.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, the good ones.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.820 align:middle line:90%
But not the lights in the sky.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But they require more training
than most field investigators

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
start out with, so you have
to apply to be on a STAR team.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's deployable, so we try
to get there within 24 hours

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.520 align:middle line:84%
because the longer evidence
sits out, it degrades.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.092 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many on that team?

00:23:20.092 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We had
a national team.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.095 align:middle line:84%
I developed-- I wrote
all the policies.

00:23:23.095 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 5 people?

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.340 align:middle line:90%
6 people?

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.530 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.113 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I would
guess probably 50.

00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 50?

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.056 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:23:29.056 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We tried to
have a couple in every state

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.585 align:middle line:84%
because that's the best
chance of getting there.

00:23:33.585 --> 00:23:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instant and quick.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes,
and that's the key.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
something happened?

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:37.768 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:23:37.768 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And we found our cases
were constantly, constantly

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:90%
being compromised.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By?

00:23:43.725 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: A couple
members of MUFON.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And it became very clear
to me-- very, very clear.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And I just had a--

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they plants?

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.912 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I believe so.

00:23:52.912 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they had
an agenda of their own.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And with an organization as
big as MUFON, it's difficult.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to
weed this out when

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:90%
you're dealing with volunteers.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
How much do you check
into their background?

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:84%
How much do you infiltrate
personal information

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.910 align:middle line:90%
and the right to privacy?

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But you almost
realize they're going

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
to be, George,
because that's where

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:90%
you get all the information.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They're getting most of
the reports reported.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:90%
So I quit.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And four years later--
it was just recently,

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
January of this year,
I have returned back

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.080 align:middle line:84%
to MUFON to help with a
very advanced team called

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:90%
the special assignments team.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about that team.

00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: This is
going to be a small unit

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.442 align:middle line:84%
that MUFON finds are cases
that just can't be put on CMS.

00:24:39.442 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:90%
These are the whistleblowers.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:84%
These are high security
cases, politicians,

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
high ranking military
members, that

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:84%
need to have something
put on record

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and very discreetly investigated
and then public someday.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Some may not-- some may have
us sit on it for two years.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Some may become confident
with our job and the abilities

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.450 align:middle line:90%
to protect them.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But the SAT team is at new
tier-- it's a third tier MUFON,

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:84%
so it offers another
chance for investigators

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:90%
to grow and develop.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really excited to be
back and to be part of that.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I think the new TV show brings
in a lot of attention to MUFON.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And with that comes
a lot of reports,

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:84%
so this team is
really going to handle

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
some of the cases that normally
would fall through the cracks

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
because they can't go
on that public CMS.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the CMS is
the case management system.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there cases that
we haven't been told about that

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.270 align:middle line:90%
or just mind boggling?

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.247 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: In MUFON
or just in general?

00:25:43.247 --> 00:25:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In general.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.121 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I believe so.

00:25:45.121 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:84%
There's cases that really have
a difficult time coming out

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that has to do with
lack of proper investigation.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of it has to do with just
the information needs to sit

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:90%
dormant for a little bit.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe most investigators
out here, boots on the ground,

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
have a couple of those
cases that you just

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.530 align:middle line:84%
walk away until the
witness is comfortable.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's
their experiences.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, not to sabotage
or to get so gung

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.152 align:middle line:84%
ho-- I call it
bravado investigation.

00:26:17.152 --> 00:26:18.860 align:middle line:84%
We're they're out
there, I got this case,

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.400 align:middle line:90%
and we're doing this.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I really let the witness make
the decisions and protect them.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.740 align:middle line:84%
It's dog-eat-dog in this
new arena of social media

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:90%
and instant bullying.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just really want
to protect our witnesses.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:35.850 align:middle line:90%
We've seen all of them.

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Travis Walton comes to mind.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.934 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
great story with him.

00:26:38.934 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Who's in the know about UFOs?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Is the president?

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.237 align:middle line:84%
See, I sometimes think
they don't even know.

00:26:44.237 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I agree.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.778 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:26:45.778 --> 00:26:49.196 align:middle line:84%
He's a temporary employee,
and especially, this president

00:26:49.196 --> 00:26:51.070 align:middle line:84%
with his relationship
with the intelligence--

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.478 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
no need to know,

00:26:51.478 --> 00:26:52.776 align:middle line:90%
so they don't tell them, right?

00:26:52.776 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Why would they?

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there would be no benefit
for the president to know

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.100 align:middle line:90%
or even most of the politicians.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is, sincerely,
a few people that control--

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They say Nixon knew.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: He probably had
not only-- like Eisenhower,

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:90%
there was a need to know.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a reason for them
to be read in and brought in.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And Nixon probably
had that as well.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Or, he had that
intelligence background.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.470 align:middle line:84%
When you think of Bush
and Cheney, did they know?

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.006 align:middle line:84%
Probably, because they
grew up in that whole--

00:27:24.006 --> 00:27:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Environment.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.185 align:middle line:84%
They were both CIA
directors and--

00:27:27.185 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Carter,
he wanted to know.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he did.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:90%
He did grow up in the culture.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.913 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clinton wanted to know.

00:27:31.913 --> 00:27:32.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he did.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.313 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: They don't grow up--

00:27:34.313 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: JFK, they
say, was killed

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
because he knew and
wanted the world to know.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: He, again,
also had that distaste

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.720 align:middle line:84%
for the kind of
secrecy that he ran

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.470 align:middle line:90%
into when he became president.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And he and his brother
were definitely

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:49.890 align:middle line:90%
champions of the people.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can't be a
champion of the people

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.880 align:middle line:90%
and keep these kind of secrets.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that
the Kennedys were

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.390 align:middle line:84%
going to call out some of the
secrecy of the FBI and CIA.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If the public
only knew, Chase,

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:84%
they'd be baffled
by all of this.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:84%
What's next in
the study of UFOs?

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: It's really
just honing in our skills

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and being more professional with
how we present our evidence,

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:84%
following proper procedures,
not being so gung

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:84%
ho with the headlines,
"Rock Found Proves Aliens."

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:84%
We have to meet a standard,
and we owe the public that.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.359 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
too, you and I know.

00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they're
desperate to find out.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:30.816 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:28:30.816 --> 00:28:32.250 align:middle line:90%
And we have the answers.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.930 align:middle line:84%
We just need to be better at
how we present our evidence

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and not be so crazy
with some of it.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Take your time.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Do your job.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And also to figure out
some of this drone activity

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and start doing our
homework out here.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've written
a kids' book on UFOs.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.010 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.786 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Because my grandson
was asking these questions,

00:28:50.786 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know what
to say to him, George.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.830 align:middle line:10%
Because at that point, I
knew whatever I told them,

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:10%
he was going to believe
because he knows what I do,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:10%
and he loves me.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.882 align:middle line:10%
And there was this
huge responsibility--

00:29:01.882 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Grandma.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.673 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah-- that I
had to be really careful

00:29:04.673 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:10%
because they're so precious.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But the questions he
asked me, I realized

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:14.430 align:middle line:84%
how much aliens and UFOs
are in their little culture.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:90%
They see it all the time.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Cartoons,
video games, everywhere.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:90%
What's the name of that book?

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: It's "Are
Aliens Really Real?"

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Chase, thanks for
being on the program.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: You're welcome.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Appreciate it.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Thanks
for having me.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: UFOs, whether
you believe or not,

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.940 align:middle line:90%
something is going on.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Just look up in the
skies on any given night,

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.650 align:middle line:10%
you'll see something strange.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:35.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.380 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:90%
