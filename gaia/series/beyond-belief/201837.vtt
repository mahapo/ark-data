Nick Groff is it an acclaimed
paranormal investigator.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:90%
He's a television personality.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
You've probably seen
him in his shows.

And he's got a new
one coming out soon

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
called "Nick Groff
Investigates."

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Nick, welcome to the program.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK GROFF: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in the paranormal?

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: It's a crazy story.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:10%
I feel like life is interesting.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.003 align:middle line:10%
We all go through
these journeys.

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:10%
And I really believe at
this point of my life,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.060 align:middle line:10%
it kind of chose me.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A calling, huh?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:10%
>>GROFF: Yeah, I feel like that.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.760 align:middle line:10%
I've tried to think
really hard about how

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.843 align:middle line:10%
I came to this point
in my life, really

00:01:03.843 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:10%
in-depth into the paranormal,
but I'm such a deep thinker.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So at age eight, I
actually fell from a tree,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:90%
and I ripped open my arm.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.562 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: Almost died, and
my mother saved my life.

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:90%
I remember passing out.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.473 align:middle line:84%
I'm blacking out, and I just
said, "Mom, I love you."

00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And right then, I collapsed.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.222 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far was the fall?

00:01:21.222 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: It was a tree.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I was a hyperactive kid,
so I climbed up in it.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went
all the way up?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yeah, all the way up.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.694 align:middle line:90%
I reached up.

00:01:26.694 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, Nick.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Limb broke.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Ripped open my whole arm,
shredded it to the bone.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Half inch--

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blood everywhere?

00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: Yeah, and I
don't remember anything.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:90%
I went into shock.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So I just remember
getting off the ground.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm blacking out and just
said, "Mom, I love you."

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Collapse.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:84%
What was interesting,
though, is years later,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I talked about this experience
once I really got heavily

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:90%
into the paranormal.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm thinking back.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:90%
All my life, I never asked you.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
When I blacked out, I remember
seeing all these faces

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:90%
around me, looking down at me.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So my mom said, there
was only two of us.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:90%
We were calling the ambulance.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had a rip off my
shirt, and tie up your arm.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: And I
carried you inside.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:84%
You know how mothers
can lift cars

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.634 align:middle line:90%
when something crazy happens?

00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:90%
The adrenaline kicks in.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: That was my mom,
and she saved my life.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I don't
know what I experienced.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was
just my body reacting,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:90%
the brain reacting.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.465 align:middle line:84%
But I had this
experience where I

00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:84%
remember just faces looking
down and hovering over me.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And I skated on thin
ice, maybe crossing over.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.117 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: Maybe this was just
an experience that kicked off

00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and it jump-started my
whole entire journey.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And then through the rest of
my life, it got interesting.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.350 align:middle line:84%
At age 13, I started
really getting involved

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:90%
into UFOs, aliens, space, time.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:90%
I was really into it.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was that weird kid
at 13 unfolding my map.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.253 align:middle line:84%
You know the old
maps we used to have?

00:02:45.253 --> 00:02:46.087 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:46.087 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: And I'd say, I want
to go to Area 51 some day.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:90%
That was me when I was 15.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.148 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: And I had a
little boombox in my room.

00:02:52.148 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Late at night, I
listened to Art Bell.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:90%
And I just listened him talk.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And then my sister's
godfather, his father

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
actually helped build
the hangars at Area 51.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: They would
tell me stories when I

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:90%
would go to visit him in Vegas.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And they'd talk to me
right before he would die.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.773 align:middle line:84%
He would talk about the
hangars and this and that.

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just enthralled
you, didn't they?

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: All of it.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The mystery, the
excitement, the adventure,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
the journey of just unfolding
what else is out there

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:84%
beyond just what
we can comprehend

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:84%
right now in our brains that we
don't have all the answers to.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
That's actually what
really just intrigued me.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
think the paranormal would

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.118 align:middle line:90%
be your career?

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I didn't at all.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I didn't.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I always thought it
was an interest in me that

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
at an early age, but I was
really heavily into film.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:90%
I just loved the aspect of film.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:90%
I loved movies.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:90%
I love stuff like that.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time,
I just studied it.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't really
know that I was

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
going to fall into
just documenting it--

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.795 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: And trying to
discover something new

00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:90%
and really push the boundaries.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rattle off, Nick,
for us the shows you've done

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:90%
or will do.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yeah.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So I co-created
"Ghost Adventures,"

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:90%
was on that for 10 seasons.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Then "Paranormal
Lockdown," I created that.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I was an executive
producer, host for that.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I lived at locations for
the last couple of years

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.212 align:middle line:84%
for 72 hours in some of the most
haunted, acclaimed locations.

00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bizarre stuff, yeah.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Weird places.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:84%
And then I created a
new show coming out

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.566 align:middle line:84%
called "Nick Groff
Investigates."

00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:90%
So it's a new series coming out.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a new perspective
on my journey.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to push
things forward.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to collectively
gather new information.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not about proving or
disproving for me anymore.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, I
would go into locations--

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You already
have the answer you need.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.772 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I feel like
I need to learn more.

00:04:38.772 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't have all the answers.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I
want to pull back

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
the layers to discover
something new, something

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:90%
beyond what we comprehend now.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's this weird
anomaly that we captured?

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Can we actually define it?

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.847 align:middle line:84%
Can we actually say
this is what that is?

00:04:53.847 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have the right
equipment or the right sense

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
of mind to actually
say it's X, Y, and Z.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really trying to push
things forward in that sense.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.543 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of ghosts?

00:05:03.543 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I don't know.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It's weird because years
ago, I would have said,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
maybe it was Joe, this
guy who worked here,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.172 align:middle line:84%
functioned here, a
human being that died.

00:05:15.172 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who died here.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.265 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: Who died here,
and we have that fact.

00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And then now,
we're communicating

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:90%
with pieces of equipment.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of equipment is
pseudoscience, too, right?

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.968 align:middle line:84%
It's like what we
define as ghosts.

00:05:24.968 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: So I'm
really trying to look

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
beyond that, different
theories, different ideas,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:90%
thinking outside the box.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what I
want to do pushing forward.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So now, I don't think ghosts
are what I thought it was.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I think we could
actually be dealing

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:90%
with some slippage of time.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I investigate two
locations for a decade now,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Bobby Mackey's Music
World in Wilder, Kentucky

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and the Washoe Club in
Virginia City, Nevada.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:10%
Those two locations,
for some reason--

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:10%
the Washoe Club has this
weird, energetic feel to--

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.440 align:middle line:10%
for me personally.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You can feel it
the minute you're there?

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:10%
>>GROFF: I just feel
like I'm drawn to it.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:10%
For some weird reason,
throughout my whole life,

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.030 align:middle line:10%
I always feel drawn back to it.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I was a minor
back in some other life.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.870 align:middle line:90%
But every time I go there--

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 2005
when I first went there.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I had a weird experience
where I would hear my name

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:90%
on the digital recorder.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And it would say--

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: --Nick Groff.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.927 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I
thought it was a ghost.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
communicating with something

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
from some other side,
some other dimension.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:90%
I didn't fully understand it.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:90%
I was also immature.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand a
lot of things about life.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't talk to great
people like yourself

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:90%
who had knowledge.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And through my course
and my journey,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I started to learn
more information.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And I want to evolve myself.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
be redundant, and I

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be redundant,
definitely, in the paranormal,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
because that's not what
the paranormal is about.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding mysteries,
being like a scientist,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:84%
discovering a new world
in another universe

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:84%
or discovering some
other space and time.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to be that person who
just breaks it a little bit

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:84%
or makes us think to the
point where we can communicate

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.564 align:middle line:84%
like human beings, and we can
evolve with new information.

00:07:08.564 --> 00:07:10.856 align:middle line:84%
Really, I feel like that's
what it's missing right now.

00:07:10.856 --> 00:07:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Our dear mutual friend,
Joshua P. Warren,

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
had the chance to talk to
me about spirits and ghosts.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:10%
I would call you a
paranormal researcher,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:10%
but you cover ghosts,
UFOs, wishing machines.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:10%
You do it all.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:10%
What's your favorite subject?

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:10%
>>JOSHUA WARREN: I think my
favorite is still ghosts,

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:10%
because ghosts was
really what I started

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:10%
studying when I was young.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:10%
And I found that if you stick
with ghosts long enough,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:10%
eventually, they
connect to UFOs.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:10%
And eventually, UFOs
connect to cryptids,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:10%
and that all connects
to psychic phenomena.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:10%
And it becomes a really
big, interesting circle

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:10%
of strange phenomena.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:10%
It reminds me of that great
quote by Charles Fort.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:10%
"You can measure a circle
beginning anywhere."

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:10%
So I'm fortunate
now that I've seen

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:10%
the many different
facets of this field we

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:10%
call the paranormal.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty fascinating.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: It is.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
a good researcher.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.153 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: Yeah, and
I believe that now.

00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of the
things that are occurring now

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:90%
is all combined.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:90%
They're all crossing over.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not cryptids
over here in this box,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:84%
ghosts in this box, UFOs,
extraterrestrials, space.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
all crossing over.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And I see the change
happening through my lifetime

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:84%
that I've started
in the paranormal.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:84%
First, I started
with UFOs and aliens.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.639 align:middle line:84%
Then I got into the ghosts,
then the paranormal,

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
the supernatural, and
just the mystery--

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just kept evolving.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.232 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: It's everything.

00:08:39.232 --> 00:08:41.284 align:middle line:84%
Anything weird,
unknown, bizarre--

00:08:41.284 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You love it.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.959 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I love it.

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in it, and
I really believe that now.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And going back to what I thought
was a ghost a decade ago, now--

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience
recently at the Washoe Club,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:84%
where I heard my voice on
the recorder a decade ago.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the location
recently for this new series

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing, I walked in and
I saw myself, in the past,

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.063 align:middle line:84%
walk into the room,
listened to the recorder,

00:09:05.063 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
hearing my voice
on the recorder--

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: --And myself in
the present time said, whoa.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Wait a second.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Are we dealing
with time slippage?

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Nick Groff."

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I said my name out loud
in the present time.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wait a second.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Is that me hearing
myself on the recording

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:90%
now on the present time?

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's I'm
capturing in the past?

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:26.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: And Are we dealing with
that at different locations.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Not just the typical
everything is a ghost,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.633 align:middle line:84%
the lights are blinking,
and that's a ghost,

00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:90%
and this is a ghost.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.053 align:middle line:84%
I think there's other
things happening

00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that we can't actually
comprehend yet

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%

technology yet.

going to explain this, Nick?

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.903 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we'll ever
get to the bottom of this?

an interesting experience,

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.278 align:middle line:90%

separate journeys

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.153 align:middle line:90%
that we have to go through life.

00:09:52.153 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And we all have to
separately experience things

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and communicate like this.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I don't think there's
a right answer for anything,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.117 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you.

that you ripple effect

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
in this universe and leave
behind, hopefully positive,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
some's negative.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
real thing, energy.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.820 align:middle line:84%
We produce and we leave energy,
like kinetic energy, when

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:84%
we move and the mind,
the conscious thoughts

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that we create and
build in our brain.

we'll know the answers until we

pass on.

and I don't believe in ghosts.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:10%
I never have-- it's
probably more so

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:10%
some kind of
magnetic disturbance

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:10%
that allows you to
see back in time.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:10%
And so when you are seeing
a ghost, what you're really

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:10%
seeing is just
someone in the past,

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:10%
and somehow you're on
some kind of weird doorway

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:10%
where you can see each other.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.700 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN: And I saw it kind of
move toward the door, and--

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:10%
>>GROFF: And it almost
looks like an energy form,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.430 align:middle line:10%
and I don't know what
it is still to this day.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.938 align:middle line:10%
And we can speculate
all day long.

00:12:05.938 --> 00:12:07.730 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN: I'm shocked when
you showed me that.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:10%
>>GROFF: Really?

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:10%
Are we dealing with something
where it's a bend in time?

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:10%
Or are we dealing
with something where

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:10%
it's energy from
somebody passing away,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:10%
and it's a tragic death where
that's just released here?

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:10%
Is that the spirit
of that individual?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:10%
Or is it just this producing our
thoughts into this environment?

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:10%
I mean what is
happening exactly here?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.430 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN: Time is not the
way we think it is,

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:10%
and I'm a big believer
like yourself.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:10%
As humans, we believe time
isn't linear, and it's all that.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:10%
And we've had a few
conversations outside of this.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.018 align:middle line:10%
I am completely with you.

00:12:41.018 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:10%
I think it's something we're
never going to understand,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:10%
but it's bending
in a very odd way.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:10%
And I know this
sounds deep, but I

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.650 align:middle line:10%
think sometimes we're
even communicating

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.600 align:middle line:10%
with our past selves.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:10%
You are a big
believer in this, too.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.475 align:middle line:10%
You're the one
who said it to me.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:57.363 align:middle line:10%
I'm completely with you on that.

00:12:57.363 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know how
much of the haunting

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.315 align:middle line:10%
is created by us or the dead.

00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's going to be
a fascinating show, Nick.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.208 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: It is
Thank you so much.

00:13:05.208 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I just want to push
the paranormal forward.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to push the way we think.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I think there's too much
redundancy happening

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
create conversations

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:84%
with each other as human
beings and just evolve.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what it's
really about, the journey.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What will be the venue
for "Nick Groff Investigates?"

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.732 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: So we're
really excited.

00:13:26.732 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
announcing really soon.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:90%
But VIDI SPACE.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.437 align:middle line:90%
We've produced this.

00:13:31.437 --> 00:13:32.270 align:middle line:90%
We're excited, and--

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's streamed, right?

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yeah.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
streaming platform.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:90%
We're excited.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we're going to be
making a big announcement

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:90%
really soon.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:90%
What drives Nick Groff?

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I think the exciting
journey of life, what's next.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I think every second that I
go to sleep, wake up, look out

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:90%
into space.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
The stars beyond the stars,
what happens when we die.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I love talking to new people
like yourself and other people

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:90%
that I crossed past with.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I've met so many
people that have

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:84%
had near-death experiences,
come back to life,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:90%
and tell me stories.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I'm always
meeting interesting people

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:90%
at weird parts of my life.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's--

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They keep
coming, don't they?

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: Yeah, and it
just keeps happening.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.405 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
the information.

00:14:15.405 --> 00:14:17.902 align:middle line:84%
I just keep gathering
and learning new things.

00:14:17.902 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really what drives me,

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:90%
the excitement of saying, wow.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:84%
That location made
me think differently

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.145 align:middle line:90%
than I did a decade ago.

00:14:25.145 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what drives me.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting to me.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:90%
It's an adventure.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.605 align:middle line:84%
It's this journey that I'm
going into the unknown,

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what's
going to happen next.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
thrill of it all for me.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, has everything
you've investigated over

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:90%
the years for all your shows--

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:84%
is there that one story that
just still creeps you out?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: [CHUCKLES] Yeah.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So recently at Bobby
Mackey's Music World--

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:90%
I lived there for three days.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered this
ball of energy, I call it.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.510 align:middle line:10%
And I thought for
the longest time

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:10%
it was this negative entity in
the basement of that location.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a weird location.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:90%
It has negative and positive.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.566 align:middle line:90%
It flips on a dime.

00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:04.774 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you can feel it?

00:15:04.774 --> 00:15:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: You can
definitely feel it.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was when
I sleeping in the basement,

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:84%
we discovered this anomaly
that formed for eight minutes

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.830 align:middle line:90%
on the camera that we set up.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.172 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: And I didn't know at
the time, but it was capturing.

00:15:16.172 --> 00:15:18.495 align:middle line:84%
And it grows in size,
and it has this plasma--

00:15:18.495 --> 00:15:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like an orb?

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: --on the outside.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like an orb, yeah.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think it holds
memory, in a sense.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: And what's interesting
about that location I

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.275 align:middle line:84%
discovered on the
new series I'm doing,

00:15:29.275 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:84%
"Nick Groff Investigates,"
when I went back there,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I learned that possibly
what we're dealing with

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:90%
is more of a tulpa thought form.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And over the century,
it has been there longer

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:90%
than the structure.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.508 align:middle line:84%
But it's gathered
all this energy

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:90%
and all this information.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And thousands of people
coming to this location

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
have produced these thoughts of,
there's something negative down

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:90%
here, something negative.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
You say that long
enough, the atmosphere

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:90%
will change at a location.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.430 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's mirror imaging.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's grown into this
anomaly and this energy.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's mirror imaging people.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.495 align:middle line:84%
When they produce
their thoughts,

00:16:00.495 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
that's what it's giving
back to them five-fold.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a big believer
in what you put out

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:84%
into the universe is what
you're going to get back.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever felt
threatened on an investigation?

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I have.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a weird feeling.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:90%
I try to stay grounded.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I try to stay humble
in my journey,

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.250 align:middle line:90%
and I have been humbled.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:90%
And I think sometimes--

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.012 align:middle line:84%
I go into a location
out of respect.

00:16:22.012 --> 00:16:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Every location holds
something different,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not going to go in--

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a cemetery, right?

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yeah.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go in and be
negative or anything like that.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.172 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be positive.

00:16:29.172 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also there to discover
as a guest in that location

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
people that we're living or
the people that are there now.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And I always look at it as, if
I go into an asylum, or prison,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
or any location, or a house,
if there's people right there

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.445 align:middle line:84%
in the past that's
occurring for them right now

00:16:45.445 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here in
the present, what

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:90%
happens if they can see me?

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And they see me as a ghost,
and I see them as a ghost,

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:84%
but we're both happening
at different times.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going in
there to communicate,

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
gather information, document
it, and try to learn and evolve.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What would you like
to learn about the paranormal

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:10%
that you haven't learned yet?

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:10%
>>GROFF: I would like
to discover new answers

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.280 align:middle line:10%
from the other side.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:10%
I think I just want to learn
something different that I

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:10%
haven't learned yet, which
what are shadow figures?

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.800 align:middle line:10%
I learned recently
at a location I

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.903 align:middle line:10%
was at in the United Kingdom,
Shepton Mallet Prison--

00:17:19.903 --> 00:17:22.445 align:middle line:10%
and I was seen shadow figures
move throughout the jail cells,

00:17:22.445 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:10%
just--

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.315 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, that
doesn't sound good.

00:17:24.315 --> 00:17:25.582 align:middle line:10%
>>GROFF: With my own eyes.

00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't figure
out for the longest time.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was negative.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:10%
But what I learned
is I'm starting

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:10%
to realize they're at
locations with huge amounts

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:10%
of dramatic occurrences
that have happened there.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:10%
A lot of bloodshed,
a lot of tragedy,

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:10%
a lot of sadness and emotions.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm learning that
they're more of observers

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:90%
of a higher intelligent being.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
where they come from.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And then we can theorize.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.202 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: We can start
speculating that maybe it's

00:17:52.202 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
cloaking, and they're there

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
observing people at this high
magnetic energy location.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's some entities that
are formed into these shadow

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:90%
figures.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.310 align:middle line:84%
That's how we view them
in a different spectrum

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:90%
from our eyes.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Or I don't know.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is something else
where they're just observing

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:90%
and gathering information.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talk
a lot about energy

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.242 align:middle line:90%
in the Nick Groff trailer.

00:18:15.242 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yes.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I look at things
a little bit differently.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I try to think of things
where energy is a real thing.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:90%
So we produce energy.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
What is energy, positive
and negative energy?

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to look
for the energy that's

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.773 align:middle line:90%
left behind by people like us.

00:18:35.773 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
We go into a location, we're
going to leave energy behind.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.148 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
somebody that dies there.

00:18:40.148 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
It can be somebody that
goes there for a decade.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It can be negative
or positive energy, right?

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Absolutely.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.372 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that energy
is left behind, traces of it.

00:18:49.372 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're dealing
with a lot of the time.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So when we walk
through a location

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and we feel the goose bumps,
or electricity, or suddenly

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:90%
I'll feel sad.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:57.750 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, whoa.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Why do I feel sad?

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Why do I feel angry?

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Why do I feel all
these emotions?

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:84%
That's traces of energy that
I believe is left behind.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:84%
We dive into that a lot, the
conscious thought, the energy,

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
the electricity, and all
those things lingering.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you opened
yourself up to the paranormal?

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, Nick, do
you find that more paranormal

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:90%
things are happening to you?

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I feel like
at a very young age,

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
having that
near-death experience,

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:84%
maybe it got me a little closer
to that other side, whatever

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:90%
happens next.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel
through my journey,

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I've always had
that sense of being

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:90%
more sensitive to energies.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like if we're in
a group of friends,

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking, having
a great conversation,

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and then somebody
walks up to our group

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.025 align:middle line:84%
where we've known
each other for years

00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:90%
and here comes this person.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
You just feel that
negative energy.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:90%
People sense that.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a real thing.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get them away, yeah.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.758 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Get them away.

00:19:50.758 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's go somewhere else.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.735 align:middle line:84%
George, let's leave this,
go have a drink somewhere.

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they follow us.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.207 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: Yeah, and
they follow us.

00:19:56.207 --> 00:19:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
way I go to locations.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like, you feel that energy.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think I've
learned to adapt to it,

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the old TVs
where you have the antennas,

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to get the signal,

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and you try to get
that perfect signal.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:14.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what I feel more of
these days, almost the antenna,

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
signaling in when I
really open myself

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and I let go of the
reality we're in.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And I really try to hone
into the spiritual energy

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:90%
or the energy of the location.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there an aspect,
Nick, of the paranormal

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.053 align:middle line:90%
you won't cover?

00:20:28.053 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I don't know.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll go--

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.672 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anything
you stay away from?

00:20:30.672 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I'll go and
try almost anything.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not going to run
into locations and be negative.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't get heavily into
the demonic entities.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't try to pull back and say
everything's a demon, because I

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:90%
just don't believe that.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're dealing with
negative and positive energies.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something more sinister.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Demonic?

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yeah.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I think however we
want to define it.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the problem,
because us as human beings,

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
we want to try to
define everything.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And we want to
vocabulize just words.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And we want to create.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.330 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a demon.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.553 align:middle line:90%
How do we know it's a demon?

00:21:04.553 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
How do I know if
I'm communicating

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.767 align:middle line:84%
with my grandmother
who passed away?

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:84%
How do I know the
feelings I'm getting right

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:90%
now at a location is--

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: You don't, but that's
the mystery, and the love,

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and the passion that
I have for all of it.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's discover,
let's communicate.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, you believe that's
what's happening.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to
you, but I'm not

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:84%
going to tear you down,
because that's your belief.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, millions
of people in this world,

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:84%
have strong beliefs of religion,
strong beliefs of spiritualism,

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:90%
strong beliefs of whatever.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Their skepticism, it
doesn't really matter.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:90%
I love it all.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.445 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to
everybody and learn, right?

00:21:39.445 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
the way to do it.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.392 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: That's life, right?

00:21:41.392 --> 00:21:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.278 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: That's
what we have to do.

00:21:43.278 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to evolve
as human beings, and better

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, and put that
positive energy off?

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:84%
When I pass away, I
want a ripple effect

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.576 align:middle line:84%
in this universe
in a positive way.

00:21:52.576 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
you're going to pass away.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:54.775 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Someday.

00:21:54.775 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're going to
come back and haunt us.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: [LAUGHS] Maybe I'll
come back and I'll talk to you.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you all the
answers to whatever happens.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.222 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From the inside.

00:22:00.222 --> 00:22:01.022 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yes.

00:22:01.022 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know paranormal
investigator Jack Cary at all?

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of him?

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I think-- yes.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.202 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a good one.

00:22:06.202 --> 00:22:09.320 align:middle line:84%
He looks in the unified field
and other paranormal activity.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I had a chance to interview
him on "Beyond Belief."

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You call your theory the unified
field of paranormal activity.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:10%
What is that?

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:10%
>>JACK CARY: Yeah.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:10%
So one branch is the interaction
with the Type III society

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:10%
I was describing.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:10%
So there is a whole vast
body of paranormal activity

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.790 align:middle line:10%
that would be covered
under that including

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:10%
cattle mutilations, unexplained
animal deaths, missing people,

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:10%
the alien abduction phenomenon,
UFO sightings in general.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:10%
>>JACK: All of that
kind of activity

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.490 align:middle line:10%
is covered under interaction
with the Type III.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:10%
The other kind of
paranormal interaction

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:10%
occurs inter dimensionally.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:10%
And it fits into all
of this same teaching,

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:10%
because what physicists
all around the world

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:10%
in these hushed conferences
are talking about

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:10%
is that other dimensions exist.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:10%
And if they exist like pages in
a book-- change the frequency,

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:10%
you could see another
dimension if you

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:10%
could change the frequency of
your body, your consciousness.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, they know
that creatures exist

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:10%
on these other dimensions.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:10%
And like Michio Kaku
mentioned, if creatures

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:10%
exist on those dimensions,
then some of them

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:10%
will have been
advanced enough to have

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.538 align:middle line:10%
found a way into this one.

00:23:23.538 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got to get them
on "Nick Groff Investigates."

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.456 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I would love to.

00:23:26.456 --> 00:23:28.248 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He'd be a good
team for a segment.

00:23:28.248 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: That's what I love
talking about, stuff like that.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is information,
and I'm a big believer

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:90%
in the dimensions.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're living
in altered dimensions,

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:90%
and these alter-realities.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like going down a
road and saying, hey,

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
should I go left today
or should I go right?

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And you make that
decision, and then

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
it just alters
different realities.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.600 align:middle line:90%
It's really fascinating to me.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's so
important, too, and I think,

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.800 align:middle line:84%
fascinating, is
that so many of you

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:84%
great investigators all
share the same views.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Right.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and that's the cool thing.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's out there.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.458 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: And I love it.

00:24:00.458 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big believer in
we should all come together.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
There's not one person
over anybody else.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some
great minds out there,

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
some great scientists,
some great, you know,

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:90%
really high IQs.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So I would love to bring
everybody together and see

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:90%
what else there is.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is death to you?

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I think it's
just the beginning.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:90%
I think it's just the beginning.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a
journey where we

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.040 align:middle line:84%
have to learn,
evolve, understand

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:90%
what our life is to be human.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's next is the
beginning of something greater.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what is that?

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I guess I'll
find out when I get there,

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I've been
searching for my whole life.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if there's
no afterlife, Nick?

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: Then I hope I made
an impact in this life for--

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could we be wrong?

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: We could.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there isn't one?

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.973 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Absolutely.

00:24:47.973 --> 00:24:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked
to multiple people

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.400 align:middle line:84%
who are my really good
friends that are skeptic.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:84%
They believe that this
is the only life you get,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:90%
and when you die, that's it.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
demons, the devil?

00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I mean--

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it exist?

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.155 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: That I don't know.

00:25:02.155 --> 00:25:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the thing.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I would be fascinated
to learn more.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something negative, just

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:90%
like human beings.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Human beings are very negative.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And some people are born
into third world countries

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:84%
where they could define it as
hell on this Earth for them.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Some people would
define this as limbo.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think again, it's
going back to life.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're all
throwing challenges at us.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's how you
conquer those challenges

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.858 align:middle line:84%
and keep pushing
forward in life.

00:25:28.858 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's just what
I've been doing.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I believe there's
something negative out there.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I think humans are
negative, at times.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Humans die, and they leave
that negativity behind.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's positive
people out there that

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
do great things,
and are positive,

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and they make a huge
impact in this world,

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and they leave that
positive behind.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's something
else negative out there

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.170 align:middle line:84%
we just don't fully understand
that can evolve over

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:84%
time, like at Bobby
Mackey's, in that basement.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Something has evolved.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't say that is
a demon or that's negative.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Some people will
define it as that.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.617 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some would.

00:26:06.617 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I would
just claim it as, OK.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
we feel is negative,

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
but is it negative in that
dimension or that reality?

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's just how it is.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in God?

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.503 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I believe
there's something greater.

00:26:19.503 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something greater.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:90%
I do believe there is a god.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I mean,
something put this together.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: It has to be.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is not a fluke.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: It has to be.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.367 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the
universes that we're

00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:84%
discovering beyond
our universe now

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:84%
that are similar to Earth,
and the sun, and space.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Infinity of stars beyond.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because I
want to look at things where

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
we go into the jungle
and there's an animal.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And we take the animal
over its habitat.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't be that way.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.002 align:middle line:84%
What happens if there's
something else out there that's

00:26:51.002 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:84%
higher intelligence, a
godlike figure, a god, gods?

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Multiple things could
occur where they come down.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:90%
They could just--

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Put us in a zoo.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: They could put is in--

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A universal, zoo.

00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yeah.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Exactly.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.975 align:middle line:84%
They could do all sorts
of experiments on us.

00:27:04.975 --> 00:27:06.100 align:middle line:90%
They could put us in a zoo.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They could study us.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:08.430 align:middle line:90%
They could learn.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Or they could be like, eh,
like an ant pile over there.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:90%
And let's go about our business.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.652 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to do anything
with them right now.

00:27:14.652 --> 00:27:15.452 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:15.452 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting to me.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When mentalist
Uri Geller appeared

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.710 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia's "Legacy" show
to talk about energy

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:25.480 align:middle line:90%
and what happens when we die.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.822 align:middle line:10%
>>URI GELLER: Albert
Einstein, 1924--

00:27:27.822 --> 00:27:30.040 align:middle line:10%
I've spoken about this--

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:10%
comes up with this amazing
scientific equation,

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.180 align:middle line:10%
E equals MC-squared,
where Albert Einstein

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.370 align:middle line:10%
proves to the world
scientifically

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:10%
that everything is made from
energy, even this chair,

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:43.690 align:middle line:10%
is energy.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:90%
It's vibrating.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Certain frequency that,
to us, feels solid.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But he also proves that
energy cannot be destroyed.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So if Albert Einstein proves
scientifically that energy

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.830 align:middle line:84%
cannot be destroyed, the
question must be asked.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're energy.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.940 align:middle line:90%
So what happens when we die?

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:90%
So you can't kill the energy.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our spirit?

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our soul?

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.450 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our mind energy?

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And I very simply
believe that when we die,

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:84%
our energy, our
spirit, our soul,

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:84%
leaves her body like
the tens of thousands

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.200 align:middle line:84%
of stories you have
from millions of people

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.180 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:90%
They left their body.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.590 align:middle line:84%
They weren't ready to die, and
they came back to their body.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They went through the tunnel
of light and with the music.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were just about
to enter that other side,

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.400 align:middle line:90%
the realm, heaven, paradise.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Call it whatever.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were drawn
back into their body.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.530 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of stories
of spirits communicating

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:90%
with their loved ones.

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Dogs, cats, animals,
humans, children.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:06.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a fact that people
accept that ghosts do exist.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So scientifically,
the scientific theory

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.400 align:middle line:90%
is very simple.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We leave our body, and we
go to a different dimension.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:10%
I want to call it
heaven, because I

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:23.460 align:middle line:10%
know that I will meet all my
family there, all my dogs.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm a great dog lover, so
I had all my life dogs.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:10%
And I know we will meet someday.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:10%
So I believe.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.392 align:middle line:84%
I'm a huge believer
in life after death.

00:29:35.392 --> 00:29:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's onto
something there, Nick.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yeah.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't he?

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yeah.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, very smart individual.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And I love the way
he defines it, too.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:90%
That's really interesting to me.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.598 align:middle line:84%
And I think the idea is
we go through our life,

00:29:48.598 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and we're challenged,
and we have hardship.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:51.750 align:middle line:90%
We have sad times, emotions.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.550 align:middle line:90%
We lose loved ones.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're humans.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: We're humans.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:84%
We want there to be
something greater.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:57.770 align:middle line:90%
We want to evolve.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:84%
We want to transcend this brain,
the consciousness, and all

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.800 align:middle line:84%
the information we gathered
through our journeys

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.750 align:middle line:90%
of this reality.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I personally would love to
become an energetic form

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and just fly, just fly away into
space to that greater place.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I would love that.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.102 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are some
of the things "Nick Groff

00:30:19.102 --> 00:30:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Investigates" will look into?

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Oh yeah.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:84%
We pull back the layers on
different ideas, perspectives,

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.960 align:middle line:84%
talk to different
people with beliefs.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.113 align:middle line:84%
And we really dive into
a lot of this discussion.

00:30:28.113 --> 00:30:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what I
like about you, too,

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Nick is you don't
put other people down

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:90%
for their belief system.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: No.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.763 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to be
treated that way, so why

00:30:37.763 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:90%
do it to anybody else?

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's their views.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:40.490 align:middle line:90%
It's their opinions.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Exactly.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
they're entitled to.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: Look, I have
friends, skeptics, believers,

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
non-believers,
very hard religion

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.698 align:middle line:90%
beliefs across the whole board.

00:30:49.698 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm friends with everybody.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And I think you have to be.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.288 align:middle line:90%
You have to be well-balanced.

00:30:53.288 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Because as an
investigator, as somebody

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:58.700 align:middle line:84%
who just going through
life as a human being,

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to learn, I
want to learn from everybody.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.852 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I don't want
to just be closed off

00:31:03.852 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:90%
and be like, this is it.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes that
science is missing that.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:84%
We want to close off, and we
need say it's X, Y, and Z,

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.630 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.203 align:middle line:90%
Let's think a little bit deeper.

00:31:13.203 --> 00:31:15.055 align:middle line:84%
Let's theorize a
little bit, and then

00:31:15.055 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:84%
put those theories
that the tests

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.312 align:middle line:90%
and see if we can validate that.

00:31:18.312 --> 00:31:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And then if we can't,
let's just keep evolving.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep trying.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's keep exploring this
world that's so vast.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What lesson would you
tell a paranormal investigator

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:84%
who is relatively
new to the field?

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Be open-minded.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Be open-minded.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Go in where you're logical.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Not everything is paranormal.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
environmental elements

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.260 align:middle line:90%
that play tribute, too.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: But just learn
the history of locations.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Look at the facts.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Be real, true-- like
you're being a detective.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Look at the truth behind what's
occurring at these locations.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Then go in and have
your own experience,

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and then talk about
your experience.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what it's really about.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:84%
You and I could both
go into a location.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Both of us might have totally
two different experiences,

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.680 align:middle line:90%
but that's a part of life.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:84%
We're experiencing stuff
around us all the time.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:12.343 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should you
go in skeptical?

00:32:12.343 --> 00:32:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: I think it's good
to have a skeptical mind.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:15.787 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's also--

00:32:15.787 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's healthy, isn't it?

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.495 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: It's
definitely healthy,

00:32:18.495 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:84%
but I also feel
like it loses track

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.210 align:middle line:84%
on your views of what
you're experiencing, too.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're just
shutting down right away,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.195 align:middle line:84%
then you're not open to
other things happening.

00:32:31.195 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.444 align:middle line:90%
So sort of like--

00:32:32.444 --> 00:32:33.244 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, no.

00:32:33.244 --> 00:32:35.637 align:middle line:84%
I like a skeptic who goes
in with an open mind--

00:32:35.637 --> 00:32:36.437 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Exactly.

00:32:36.437 --> 00:32:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --who wants
to find the truth.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.777 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: That's
what I want to do.

00:32:39.777 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not a naysayer,
not a, ah, isn't real.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:90%
This isn't going to happen.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.308 align:middle line:84%
I want someone who
comes in and says,

00:32:45.308 --> 00:32:46.600 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what's going on.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yep, yep.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:47.520 align:middle line:90%
And we're--

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's what you do.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: We're dealing
with the unknown.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.210 align:middle line:90%
It's all weird.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's all weird stuff.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.257 align:middle line:84%
And you got to have fun,
too, while you're doing it.

00:32:53.257 --> 00:32:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Not everything is so serious.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the problem, too.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at things that--

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:90%
look.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We hunt for ghosts,
we hunt for Bigfoots,

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.610 align:middle line:90%
and we hunt for UFOs, alien.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:90%
It should be fun, crazy, wild.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Have fun.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It's life.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:90%
We're living, we're breathing.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy life.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.510 align:middle line:84%
But also, it's
good to be serious

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:84%
when you're dissecting the weird
phenomenons that are happening.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's also fun to
laugh at ourselves

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and be like, what
was I doing crawling

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.600 align:middle line:84%
into that little morgue
slab and laying in there

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and trying to document a
ghost trying to talk to me?

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
world we live in.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Just enjoy it.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a paranormal
hot spot you will not approach?

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: There was
one long time ago.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I actually said a
decade ago I would never

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:84%
go back to Bobby Mackey's, but
there was a reason for that.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I was just in a weird,
bad place in my life.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.550 align:middle line:90%
I was depressed.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:45.780 align:middle line:90%
I was around negative people.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.488 align:middle line:84%
It was just really rubbing
off on me, and you know--

00:33:48.488 --> 00:33:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's not good.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:49.970 align:middle line:10%
And

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.560 align:middle line:10%
>>GROFF: I said on
camera, oh, I'm never

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.685 align:middle line:10%
going back there right now.

00:33:52.685 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:10%
It's going to do more
harm than good for me.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.840 align:middle line:10%
And then years later,
I went back there.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.751 align:middle line:10%
Because it's not that
I would necessarily

00:33:58.751 --> 00:34:01.001 align:middle line:10%
want to face my fears and
be all courageous and tough.

00:34:01.001 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You had charged.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:10%
>>GROFF: I changed.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.830 align:middle line:10%
I matured.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.413 align:middle line:84%
I understand life a
little bit better,

00:34:05.413 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:84%
but I was also in a
better place in my life.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.260 align:middle line:90%
I was positive.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
almost shielded,

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want negative to
disrupt my own world, my life

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.270 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of went back in
with a different perspective

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:84%
in a more logical sense, and
really, just went in there

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:90%
to try to document further.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been doing
it for a long time.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.889 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really good
friends with Bobby and--

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: --the
whole staff there.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's been an amazing journey.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:34.163 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people track
"Nick Groff Investigates?"

00:34:34.163 --> 00:34:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GROFF: It's going
to VIDI SPACE.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So on VIDI SPACE,
people can go there.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:90%
We're updating all the time.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm releasing a lot of
stuff on my Instagram.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.359 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you have a website?

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:44.159 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Not yet.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.889 align:middle line:84%
But just my Instagram, I'm
releasing all my own trailers,

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and social media--

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:47.564 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, good for you.

00:34:47.564 --> 00:34:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: --and stuff like that.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's just
Nick Groff on Instagram?

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Nick, yep.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.443 align:middle line:90%
Just Nick Groff, underscore.

00:34:53.443 --> 00:34:55.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the one with the
little blue check.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:55.910 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of--

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: G-R-O-F-F?

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: That's it.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Nick, thanks, and
happy hunting on

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:90%
your paranormal investigations.

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Thank you so much.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:02.937 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And be safe.

00:35:02.937 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I'll try my best.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:04.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are times where
a paranormal investigator can

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.860 align:middle line:90%
get too close.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yeah.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And get attached.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: Yep.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
can get to 'em.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:90%
So you be careful.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GROFF: I will.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.438 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's a
great investigator.

00:35:16.438 --> 00:35:18.420 align:middle line:10%
We need more people
like Nick Groff.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm looking forward to
his new show, "Nick Groff

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.330 align:middle line:10%
Investigates."

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
