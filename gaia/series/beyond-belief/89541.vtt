(atmospheric electronic music)

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.290
(atmospheric music)

3
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.350
<v ->Hi, I'm Peter Russell</v>

4
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.810
and all my life I've been fascinated by science

5
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.370
and the discoveries it is making about the world.

6
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.605
But the one thing that science hasn't been able to explain

7
00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:07.545
is the very fact that we are conscious.

8
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:10.265
That we each have an inner-world of experience.

9
00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:13.325
It's easier to explain how life evolved from simple cells

10
00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:15.600
into human beings than it is to explain

11
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.695
why any of us ever has a single conscious thought.

12
00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:21.875
And yet the very fact that we are conscious

13
00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.656
is the one thing we cannot deny.

14
00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:27.155
This is the great mystery of consciousness.

15
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:30.600
Why do we have this capacity for inner-experience?

16
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.810
And it's not just human beings that have it.

17
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.990
I often hear scientists say that animals aren't conscious,

18
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.930
but is that really so?

19
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.610
When I see a dog lying on the floor asleep

20
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.690
and its legs are twitching and its nose is quivering,

21
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.690
I imagine it's dreaming and if it's dreaming

22
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.710
it's having an experience.

23
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.930
And also, why else would be bother giving our pets

24
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.590
anesthetics when we operate

25
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.110
if we didn't believe they were conscious?

26
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.890
Why would we want to make them unconscious?

27
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.170
The difference with humans beings is that

28
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.730
we know that we know.

29
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.080
We are conscious that we are conscious.

30
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.165
Now one way of thinking about consciousness

31
00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:11.565
is to liken it to the light inside a film projector.

32
00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:15.965
(film reel rapidly clicking)
(atmospheric music)

33
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:19.425
At the heart of the projector is a sort of white light

34
00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:22.165
and the light shines through the film and takes on

35
00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:24.345
the colors and forms of the film

36
00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:27.545
and then an image appears on the screen.

37
00:02:27.545 --> 00:02:30.605
Now what we're actually seeing is just shaped light

38
00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:33.225
but we get so engrossed in the movie,

39
00:02:33.225 --> 00:02:35.805
the stories, the feelings we're having, the sadness,

40
00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:37.585
the horror, the excitement,

41
00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:40.445
that we forget it's all just a form

42
00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:42.945
that light has taken on.

43
00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:45.305
A similar process happens in the mind.

44
00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:48.245
All I ever actually experience are the images

45
00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:50.935
appearing in my consciousness.

46
00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:53.965
But it doesn't seem that way.

47
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.585
When I see a tree, it looks as if I'm seeing

48
00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:58.185
the tree directly.

49
00:02:58.185 --> 00:03:00.085
But science tells me something completely

50
00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:02.065
different is happening.

51
00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:05.905
Light enters the eye where it's absorbed by the retina

52
00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:08.225
and it triggers electrical impulses

53
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:10.925
which travel down nerve fibers to the brain.

54
00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:14.285
The brain then analyzes the data and from that

55
00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:16.985
create its own picture of the world.

56
00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:20.490
I then have the experience of seeing a tree.

57
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.680
What I'm actually seeing is not the tree itself

58
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.720
but the image of a tree that appears in my mind

59
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.220
and this is true of everything I experience.

60
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.420
Every sound, color, sensation,

61
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.120
taste, smell, memory, thought,

62
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.980
they're all just images appearing in my mind.

63
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.530
It's all forms that consciousness is taking on.

64
00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:54.084
(atmospheric music)

65
00:04:04.484 --> 00:04:07.304
But where does consciousness itself come from?

66
00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:09.144
This is the great mystery.

67
00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:12.444
It may be that one day we'll understand the brain so well

68
00:04:12.444 --> 00:04:15.144
that we know the exact physical processes that go on

69
00:04:15.144 --> 00:04:18.084
when we have the experience of seeing a tree,

70
00:04:18.084 --> 00:04:20.424
but even when we do, the question still remains

71
00:04:20.424 --> 00:04:23.144
of why is there consciousness in the first place?

72
00:04:23.144 --> 00:04:27.444
Why doesn't all this brain activity go on in the dark?

73
00:04:27.444 --> 00:04:28.944
This is what philosophers call

74
00:04:28.944 --> 00:04:31.804
"The hard problem of consciousness."

75
00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:34.364
How is it that something as unconscious

76
00:04:34.364 --> 00:04:37.504
as the matter of the brain, can ever give rise to something

77
00:04:37.504 --> 00:04:41.204
as immaterial as an experience?

78
00:04:41.204 --> 00:04:43.464
I think it's not actually a hard problem,

79
00:04:43.464 --> 00:04:45.884
so much as an impossible problem.

80
00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:48.944
Impossible within the current paradigm.

81
00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:52.424
(atmospheric music)

82
00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:54.944
In some ways we're like the medieval astronomers

83
00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:56.604
who were locked into the view that the Earth

84
00:04:56.604 --> 00:04:58.444
was the center of the Universe

85
00:04:58.444 --> 00:05:02.004
with the Sun, Moon and stars orbiting around it.

86
00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:03.965
But there was a problem with this view.

87
00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:07.084
The planets did not move smoothly through the sky.

88
00:05:07.084 --> 00:05:11.004
The wandered back and forth amongst the other stars.

89
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:13.364
The medieval astronomers tried to explain the peculiar

90
00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:14.725
movement of the planets

91
00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:17.864
with increasingly complex systems of orbits,

92
00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:19.869
but nothing seemed to work.

93
00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.499
When Copernicus came along

94
00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.119
and suggested the Earth might be spinning around the Sun,

95
00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:29.279
no one took him seriously.

96
00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.699
And when Galileo found evidence to support Copernicus,

97
00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.879
the bishops refused to look through his telescope

98
00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.559
knowing it could not be true.

99
00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.039
It was only 100-years later when Sir Isaac Newton

100
00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.179
did the math and proved the new view was correct

101
00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:46.279
that the paradigm was finally established.

102
00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.439
Today we're in a similar position regarding consciousness.

103
00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.919
We are locked into the view that consciousness itself

104
00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.139
is somehow created by the brain

105
00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.859
and people have tried various ways to explain this.

106
00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:58.439
Some think it's to do with the processing

107
00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.039
over the brain as a whole,

108
00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.879
some think it's to do with quantum effects

109
00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.839
inside nerve cells, but try as they may,

110
00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.199
no one has succeeded in explaining

111
00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.319
how any purely material process could ever give rise

112
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.379
to an experience in the mind.

113
00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:14.279
We're rather like the medieval astronomers

114
00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.019
who never questioned their basic assumption.

115
00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:19.279
And what is our basic assumption today?

116
00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.579
It is that matter is not conscious.

117
00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:24.359
That matter is totally devoid of the capacity

118
00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:26.119
for experience.

119
00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:30.289
(zapping)

120
00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.519
(atmospheric music)

121
00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:39.634
An alternative assumption, and one that's been taken

122
00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:42.674
seriously by a growing number of people

123
00:06:42.674 --> 00:06:45.374
is that the capacity for experience is present

124
00:06:45.374 --> 00:06:47.654
to some degree in everything.

125
00:06:47.654 --> 00:06:49.694
Awareness itself isn't something

126
00:06:49.694 --> 00:06:51.174
that's created by the brain.

127
00:06:51.174 --> 00:06:54.014
It doesn't suddenly appear as if by magic out of nowhere

128
00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:55.925
once a particular arrangement of the nervous system

129
00:06:55.925 --> 00:06:57.185
has evolved.

130
00:06:57.185 --> 00:07:01.765
The capacity for experience is there all along.

131
00:07:01.765 --> 00:07:03.725
Now this isn't actually such a new idea.

132
00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:06.110
We find it's a common theme in Eastern philosophy,

133
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.910
many Western philosophers have explored it,

134
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.350
but it's never been taken seriously by Western science.

135
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.150
What happens if we do take it seriously?

136
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.570
It turns out it doesn't really change anything in science.

137
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.170
Mathematics is still the same.

138
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.290
The laws of physics all hold true.

139
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.850
Chemistry, biology,

140
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.130
everything we've discovered there is the same.

141
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.870
What it changes is our view of ourselves

142
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.790
and our place in the Cosmos.

143
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.530
It puts consciousness right back at the center of things.

144
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.510
In this view, consciousness is not limited to creatures

145
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.290
with nervous systems.

146
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.110
Even a simple bacterium has a faint glimmer of awareness.

147
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.150
Nothing like the rich experience we know.

148
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.110
Nothing like a thought or a feeling.

149
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.450
Perhaps just the faintest sense of warmth or light.

150
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.110
If numbers could be put to it,

151
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.550
maybe a billionth of human consciousness,

152
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.170
but not nothing at all.

153
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.050
As life became more complex,

154
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.250
also its experience of the world became more complex.

155
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.850
When it developed sensory systems, it was able to take in

156
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.010
more information from the world.

157
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.330
And then later as it developed nervous systems,

158
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.285
it was able to process that information

159
00:08:11.285 --> 00:08:13.105
and get a better picture of the world around.

160
00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:15.025
So the image that appeared in consciousness

161
00:08:15.025 --> 00:08:17.545
got richer and more detailed

162
00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:19.125
and then with human beings,

163
00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:21.185
evolution took another step forward

164
00:08:21.185 --> 00:08:23.025
because we not only see the world

165
00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:26.025
and hear the world in all its incredible detail,

166
00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:28.245
we can also think about our experience.

167
00:08:28.245 --> 00:08:30.345
We can reflect upon it.

168
00:08:30.345 --> 00:08:32.965
And we can also then begin to reflect upon ourselves

169
00:08:32.965 --> 00:08:34.965
and the fact that we are experiencing,

170
00:08:34.965 --> 00:08:36.945
and we notice that we are conscious.

171
00:08:36.945 --> 00:08:39.865
We become conscious of consciousness itself.

172
00:08:39.865 --> 00:08:43.005
And this is the next great step that we've made.

173
00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:46.085
We have made the step into self-awareness.

174
00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:50.195
(atmospheric music)

175
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.510
(moody electronic music)

176
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:14.060
With self-awareness came a sense of a self.

177
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.650
Of an 'I' that is aware.

178
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.530
But what exactly is the self?

179
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.630
This feeling of 'I' that we all know so well.

180
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.310
This is the second great mystery of consciousness.

181
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.410
We use the world 'I' so much,

182
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.270
you'd think we knew what we meant by it.

183
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.410
But as soon as you try to define this thing we call 'I',

184
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.490
you run into problems.

185
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.570
Who am I?

186
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.830
How do I define myself?

187
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.270
Peter Russell?

188
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.270
That's just my name.

189
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.930
A writer?

190
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.030
That's an activity from my past.

191
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.230
A man?

192
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.890
I have a male body,

193
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.550
but I can imagine myself in a female body.

194
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.790
I might have different perceptions, feelings and values,

195
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.590
but the 'I' that has them would be the same.

196
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:03.070
It's that same sense of 'I' that has been there all my life.

197
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.915
What is this 'I' that is always there?

198
00:10:13.225 --> 00:10:15.025
To know what the self really is,

199
00:10:15.025 --> 00:10:18.245
we need to carefully observe our own consciousness.

200
00:10:18.245 --> 00:10:21.385
This is the path that many spiritual seekers have explored.

201
00:10:21.385 --> 00:10:23.665
They've looked deep within their own minds

202
00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.645
trying to find the essence of self

203
00:10:26.645 --> 00:10:29.365
and they all come up with the same answer.

204
00:10:29.365 --> 00:10:30.855
There's nothing there.

205
00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:34.925
No thing we can call the self.

206
00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:37.685
This sense of a unique, separate, individual self

207
00:10:37.685 --> 00:10:39.365
turns out to be an illusion,

208
00:10:39.365 --> 00:10:42.155
albeit a very convincing illusion.

209
00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:48.665
This feeling we call 'I' is just the feeling

210
00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:50.365
of being conscious.

211
00:10:50.365 --> 00:10:54.175
Many experience it as simply a sense of being.

212
00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:02.006
But because we don't normally recognize that what we are

213
00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:04.345
is this inner-quality of being,

214
00:11:04.345 --> 00:11:07.805
we keep looking for some thing we can call the self

215
00:11:07.805 --> 00:11:09.945
and so we dress ourselves up in all these

216
00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:11.246
psychological clothes.

217
00:11:11.246 --> 00:11:13.565
Things like the roles we play in life.

218
00:11:13.565 --> 00:11:16.585
The way people see us, the things we do.

219
00:11:16.585 --> 00:11:19.325
Our personality, our character.

220
00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:21.645
But these are all images of the self, they're not

221
00:11:21.645 --> 00:11:23.425
the self in its true essence.

222
00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:25.145
It's almost like the opposite to the Emperor

223
00:11:25.145 --> 00:11:28.245
having no clothes, in this case there's lots of clothes

224
00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:30.695
but no Emperor underneath.

225
00:11:32.265 --> 00:11:34.585
If we imagine ourselves to be the various ideas we have

226
00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:37.485
of the self then our sense of identity

227
00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:40.945
is always at the mercy of events in the world.

228
00:11:40.945 --> 00:11:44.385
If our circumstances change, if our roles change,

229
00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:46.325
if the way people see us changes,

230
00:11:46.325 --> 00:11:49.385
then our very sense of identity can be threatened.

231
00:11:49.385 --> 00:11:52.365
And as a result of this we spend a lot of time and energy

232
00:11:52.365 --> 00:11:56.205
trying to fend off threats to our identity,

233
00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:59.305
trying to bolster our self-image,

234
00:11:59.305 --> 00:12:01.765
buying things we don't really need.

235
00:12:01.765 --> 00:12:03.935
Trying to be someone.

236
00:12:09.065 --> 00:12:12.365
On the other hand, when we discover what we really are,

237
00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:14.245
when we discover this sense of being

238
00:12:14.245 --> 00:12:15.845
that's always underneath,

239
00:12:15.845 --> 00:12:18.545
there comes a sense of liberation.

240
00:12:18.545 --> 00:12:21.405
There's the realization that we don't need to do anything

241
00:12:21.405 --> 00:12:23.385
in order to be anybody.

242
00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:26.125
And with that the mind relaxes.

243
00:12:26.125 --> 00:12:28.995
There's a sense of deep relief.

244
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.240
Underlying everything we do in life,

245
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.920
everything we're looking for, everything we're chasing,

246
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.860
there's one common desire, one universal purpose

247
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.940
and that is, we want to feel better.

248
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.520
We want to feel more satisfied,

249
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.720
more fulfilled, more at ease.

250
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.240
None of us wants to be in pain or suffereing.

251
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.520
We want to avoid that if we can.

252
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.920
We all want to feel happier, have more joy in life.

253
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.760
What this ultimately means is that

254
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.800
what we're really for is not things so much as

255
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.300
a better state of mind.

256
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.280
A more satisfying state of consciousness.

257
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.900
This is the mind's bottom line.

258
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.580
As the Dalai Lama put it,

259
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.200
"In the final analysis, the hope of every person

260
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.326
"is simply peace of mind."

261
00:13:42.575 --> 00:13:43.975
There's nothing wrong with this.

262
00:13:43.975 --> 00:13:46.255
It's completely natural.

263
00:13:46.255 --> 00:13:48.635
Where we go wrong is in the ways we go about

264
00:13:48.635 --> 00:13:50.975
finding peace of mind.

265
00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:55.070
<v ->Welcome to Beverly Hills, you have arrived!</v>

266
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.270
<v ->So we chase after wealth, possession,</v>

267
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.410
fashion and fame in the hope that if we

268
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.230
just got enough we'd finally be happy.

269
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.430
Now sometimes we do find what we're looking for,

270
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.650
and we do feel happy again,

271
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.670
but it's not a happiness which lasts.

272
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.170
So we start looking for something else

273
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.150
to make us feel better.

274
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.400
Many of us spend our whole lives just looking.

275
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.130
Yet the truth is, it isn't having the right things

276
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.690
or experiences that makes us happy.

277
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.690
When we examine our minds closely,

278
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.210
we find the very opposite.

279
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.990
When we think there's something missing,

280
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.430
something we need in order to be happy,

281
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.436
we create for ourselves a feeling of discontent.

282
00:14:37.826 --> 00:14:40.866
This I often think is the sad joke about human beings.

283
00:14:40.866 --> 00:14:42.646
We're so busy worrying

284
00:14:42.646 --> 00:14:45.606
about whether or not we're gonna be at peace in the future,

285
00:14:45.606 --> 00:14:47.946
we never allow ourselves to be at peace

286
00:14:47.946 --> 00:14:50.016
in the present moment.

287
00:15:00.086 --> 00:15:04.326
(relaxed music)

288
00:15:04.326 --> 00:15:06.806
How can we be more in the present?

289
00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:08.886
In itself it's quite simple.

290
00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:12.166
It's just a matter of relaxing the attention

291
00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:13.966
and opening our awareness

292
00:15:13.966 --> 00:15:17.381
to what we're actually experiencing.

293
00:15:17.381 --> 00:15:21.421
Just noticing the actual sensations in your body.

294
00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.201
Flowing of the breaths.

295
00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:25.381
Feeling in the hands.

296
00:15:25.381 --> 00:15:28.381
Just noticing what is, as it is,

297
00:15:28.381 --> 00:15:30.411
without thinking about it.

298
00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:35.222
Our experience of the body is always

299
00:15:35.222 --> 00:15:36.841
in the present moment.

300
00:15:36.841 --> 00:15:38.701
It's our thinking about it that takes us

301
00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:40.761
out of the present.

302
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:43.001
The mind's been so deeply ingrained to think about

303
00:15:43.001 --> 00:15:45.671
what's going on that very easily it jumps in

304
00:15:45.671 --> 00:15:48.931
and off again on some train of thought.

305
00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:51.191
When you realize that has happened,

306
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:54.331
just simply relax the attention again

307
00:15:54.331 --> 00:15:57.271
and once more become aware of what is actually happening

308
00:15:57.271 --> 00:15:59.591
in the present moment.

309
00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:01.771
The practice itself is simple.

310
00:16:01.771 --> 00:16:03.511
Like any other practice.

311
00:16:03.511 --> 00:16:05.631
(piano notes)

312
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.631
It's just a matter of repeating the process again and again

313
00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:11.621
and gradually it gets easier and easier.

314
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:27.441
The world's spiritual traditions

315
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:29.821
appear on the surface to be very different.

316
00:16:29.821 --> 00:16:32.201
They have different views on the origin of life,

317
00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:33.941
or our place in the Universe,

318
00:16:33.941 --> 00:16:36.856
or what happens to us when we die.

319
00:16:36.856 --> 00:16:39.316
Some believe in a supreme being.

320
00:16:39.316 --> 00:16:41.456
Some believe in many deities.

321
00:16:41.456 --> 00:16:44.316
Others don't talk of God at all.

322
00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:48.396
But they do have some common underlying themes.

323
00:16:48.396 --> 00:16:50.736
They all see that we get caught in attitudes

324
00:16:50.736 --> 00:16:53.176
and beliefs that don't serve us well.

325
00:16:53.176 --> 00:16:55.776
That lead you to behave in ways that are harmful to others,

326
00:16:55.776 --> 00:16:59.141
and often, not even in our own best interests.

327
00:17:00.191 --> 00:17:02.871
Each spiritual tradition seeks in its own way,

328
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:06.051
some through prayer, meditation, or devotion,

329
00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:08.491
to open to the inner-world of the mind.

330
00:17:08.491 --> 00:17:10.552
The world of the spirit.

331
00:17:10.552 --> 00:17:12.731
They want to liberate our souls.

332
00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:15.231
To free our minds from self-centered attitudes

333
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:17.611
and materialist attachments

334
00:17:17.611 --> 00:17:21.336
by urging us to discover who and what we really are.

335
00:17:22.286 --> 00:17:24.346
In one way or another they are talking about

336
00:17:24.346 --> 00:17:26.476
a shift in consciousness.

337
00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:29.206
Consider what happens when we find ourselves

338
00:17:29.206 --> 00:17:30.946
stuck in a traffic jam.
(car horns)

339
00:17:30.946 --> 00:17:34.366
A traffic jam only has the power to stop the traffic.

340
00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:38.306
It does not inject adrenaline into your bloodstream.

341
00:17:38.306 --> 00:17:41.141
If you're feeling upset, it's because the voice in your head

342
00:17:41.141 --> 00:17:43.441
is telling you that you're gonna be late,

343
00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:45.321
and if you're late bad things may happen.

344
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:48.296
You may miss the meeting, you may be late home.

345
00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:50.536
It's this that's making you upset.

346
00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:54.626
The fear that you will not be happy sometime in the future.

347
00:18:09.026 --> 00:18:13.396
(atmospheric music)

348
00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.766
Western science has been remarkably successful

349
00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.946
with explaining the world around us,

350
00:18:21.946 --> 00:18:24.006
but it hasn't given us meaning.

351
00:18:24.006 --> 00:18:27.106
The world it describes is a dry, material world

352
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.466
without any real purpose.

353
00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:31.326
And science has also given us an abundance

354
00:18:31.326 --> 00:18:33.026
of technologies which we've used

355
00:18:33.026 --> 00:18:36.026
to satisfy many of our needs and desires.

356
00:18:36.026 --> 00:18:38.666
But again, it hasn't given us values.

357
00:18:38.666 --> 00:18:41.106
It doesn't tell us the best way to use

358
00:18:41.106 --> 00:18:43.326
this incredible knowledge and power.

359
00:18:43.326 --> 00:18:46.406
It also hasn't really helped us develop inwardly.

360
00:18:46.406 --> 00:18:50.206
If anything, it's reinforced our sense of self-centeredness.

361
00:18:50.206 --> 00:18:52.421
We're probably more full of ourselves today

362
00:18:52.421 --> 00:18:54.481
than we've ever been.

363
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:57.361
I think what we need today is an integration

364
00:18:57.361 --> 00:18:59.961
of our scientific understanding of the world

365
00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:01.961
with the wisdom that's held in the world's

366
00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:03.731
spiritual traditions.

367
00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:08.401
The origins of consciousness may remain a mystery

368
00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:10.861
but how to awaken our consciousness,

369
00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:14.401
how to free ourselves from misguided attitudes and values,

370
00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:16.901
to discover who and what we really are,

371
00:19:16.901 --> 00:19:19.021
that is not a mystery.

372
00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:20.901
That's something that's been explored by

373
00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:23.401
spiritual teachers from the around the world.

374
00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:26.121
People who've gone deep within their own minds

375
00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:28.621
and discovered the true nature of consciousness

376
00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:30.501
and from that, how to live

377
00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:32.901
with joy and love in their hearts,

378
00:19:32.901 --> 00:19:34.741
and that's what we need today.

379
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:38.871
We need to rediscover that wisdom for ourselves.

381
00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:46.641
The next great frontier

382
00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:48.521
is not outer space,

383
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:50.681
it's inner-space.

384
00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:54.361
Research into the nature of consciousness itself.

385
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:57.021
The one thing we all know for sure

386
00:19:57.021 --> 00:20:00.491
and the one thing we've not yet explored.
