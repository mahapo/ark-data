00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to another edition

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.580 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and I have a
very special friend and guest

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:10%
for you tonight,
Linda Moulton Howe.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:84%
She, of course, appears
regularly on "Coast to Coast."

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:84%
She is an award-winning
documentary producer.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And she, of course, has won
the Emmy awards for her work.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
She also hosts the Gaia
show "Truth Hunter," which

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:84%
deals with many of
the topics that we've

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:90%
dealt with over the years.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Tonight we're going to
talk about something

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
very different, a universe
that may not be real.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's computer-simulated.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Linda, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.111 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDA MOULTON
HOWE: Thanks, George.

00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:10%
It's really fun to be
with you on this show.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:10%
And I remember the very first
time that I saw a headline,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.680 align:middle line:10%
and it was a
newspaper that said,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:10%
are we living in a
computer-simulated universe?

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was just,
halt. And I have

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.251 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get to the bottom
of that for a long time.

00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a subject.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:10%
>>HOWE: Well, it is, because
it was only a year ago,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:10%
and it was in April of
2016 that at the American

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:10%
Museum of Natural
History in New York

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:10%
there came together
Neil deGrasse

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:10%
Tyson, an astrophysicist, a
mathematician, a philosopher,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:10%
and they had the most
packed crowd they have ever

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:10%
had in the museum.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And the question that
they were debating,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:84%
are we living in a
computer-simulated universe?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is just
bizarre, isn't it?

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Well, wait
till you hear some

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:90%
of the things that come out.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So during that discussion,
there is a professor, Jim Gates,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:90%
from the University of Maryland.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And he studies supersymmetry.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:84%
This is dealing with
subatomic particles.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going into atoms,
we're going to quarks, leptons.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And he presented evidence
that has puzzled him

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:90%
and everybody else.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that when he is
studying quarks, leptons down

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
in the subatomic world that
they are finding what are

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:90%
called error code corrections?

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:10%
>>HOWE: That in this world,
when we work on a computer

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:10%
and we need a browser, it is
the transmission of information

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:10%
through browsers to computers.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
We have to have the same
error code correction.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Or you might say, he's
finding in the study

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:84%
of the subatomic world in
the universe error codes

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.280 align:middle line:84%
that are like what we are
using in computers on Earth.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:90%
That starts the discussion.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Two months later, Las Vegas.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the big Recode
computer conference.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Elon Musk is their star.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: He gets asked on
the stage in Las Vegas,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:84%
are we living in a
simulated universe?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And he says-- and it's been all
over the world, this quote--

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
the odds are billions
to one that we

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
are in what is called a
base universe, meaning

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:90%
natural evolution.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And what he means
is he, Elon Musk,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
who is the owner and the guy who
keeps SpaceX and Tesla going--

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: He's convinced this
is a simulated universe.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Now that was last year.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's jump to last month.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
February 2017, a paper comes out
in "Physical Review Letters."

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a very prestigious journal.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And we are living in a
holographic universe.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists,
there is a whole group,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and their reputations
are on the line.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And they have, right in the
report, substantial evidence.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.555 align:middle line:90%
You don't hear scientists--

00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: OK.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Now let's come to the question,
what is a holographic universe?

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: You've been
probably to Disney,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and you've probably been
in the haunted house,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:90%
and you've probably seen--

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
it can be faces, it
can be people dancing.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Those are holograms.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And the way it's done,
you take a laser,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and you do actually
a reference laser.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you take another
laser, and you photograph you

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
with a laser from two or three
different points of view,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and you end up with an
interference pattern that

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
can be fed into a
computer, and it

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
will project out perfect
replica of you using light.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'm really
not there, or am I?

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: No.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:90%
You've been photographed.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:90%
But here is the key.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the key to everything
that we'll discuss.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:84%
The projector cannot be in the
same room with the holograms.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Mathematically,
it does not work.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:90%
So now think about this.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
When you're at Disney and
you're seeing the holograms that

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:84%
are out in front of you,
it's being projected

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:90%
by something you do not see.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So the magic is, here is
this world that takes place

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:90%
in front of you like magic.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like magic.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: And the truth is, if
you say Disney is the cosmos,

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:90%
there is a projector.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And that projector is working
with lasers and lights,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
but it is projecting a world
that to our minds looks real.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Even if it glows,
you get the sense

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
that you are watching
something that

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
is almost like a reflection
of something on the Earth.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who created that?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Well, now we get
into this whole issue of,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
if the projector has to be
in another dimension, which

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:90%
dimension?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Who runs that dimension?

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Now one of the
most fascinating interviews

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I've ever, ever done was
in 2007 with Jerry Wills.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:90%
He's down in Phoenix.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:90%
He takes trips to Peru.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:90%
He's married to a woman, Kathy.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They got married back
in 1998 in the fall.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that he most wanted to do,

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted his new
bride to be with him,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.940 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to go down to a
place called around Aramu Muru,

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
A-R-A-M-U M-U-R-U. And that's
where the Aymara Indians live.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.200 align:middle line:84%
It's in the southwestern
part of Lake Titicaca.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Here's Peru.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Here's the Bolivian border.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.130 align:middle line:84%
They share this border
almost right where this is.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:90%
What is Aramu Muru?

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It is a solid red,
beautiful rock.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Gorgeous.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And carved in it,
think of a rectangle

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:90%
that goes 23 feet up here, 23.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Then when you come down to the
ground, here is another door,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:90%
goes into the rock deeper.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:90%
It's about seven feet.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:84%
A 6 foot 9 inch man, bowing his
head a little, can go in there.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:90%
But there is no entrance.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just carved into
this red rock, surrounded

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:90%
by this 23-foot rectangle.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And is the Aymara Indians for
centuries, they have said--

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They made this?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: No, no, no.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
The Indians have said,
this was made by gods

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:84%
to be a two-dimensional,
two going and coming doorway

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:90%
to where the gods live.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Jerry had studied,
and he had a guy

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
named Pedro, one of
the Aymara Indians

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
who said on this
trip with his bride

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
as a celebration, that he
would take Jerry and teach him

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
how to get down on his
knees, put his forehead

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:90%
in this little kind of like a--

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:90%
I've seen a picture.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:34.279 align:middle line:84%
It just looks like the rock
goes in like this, like a ledge.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Puts the forehead in
there, and a shaman

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
taught him a sound
frequency said with symbols.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Jerry has shared it with
me, and has asked me never,

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:90%
ever to repeat it.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And that if Jerry
got his forehead

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and did this chanting of this
frequency just correctly,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.870 align:middle line:84%
he would literally
disappear and would

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
go to another dimension, the
dimension of where the gods

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.724 align:middle line:90%
live, and hopefully come back.

00:09:06.724 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was going to ask.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Can you come back?

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: So his wife
is 100 feet away.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
She is watching
the entire scene.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Jerry gets down on his
knees, he leans forward

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
with his forehead, he
puts it in the rock.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Many, many times, he
says this frequency.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And then she sees him disappear.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Literally disappears.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have, I think, what
happens next with Jerry,

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:90%
we can at least share his words.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:90%
He goes to a white place.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.425 align:middle line:90%
It's like a laboratory.

00:09:50.425 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:90%
It has a hard floor.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.036 align:middle line:84%
And a voice comes
in, a male voice--

00:09:57.036 --> 00:09:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he scared
when this is happening?

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: He's completely-- he
has no idea what's happened.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
He was there at the rock,
and then it's all white,

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
but his feet are on something
here compared to Lexan.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:90%
He tried to jump on it.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And then this male voice comes
and starts talking to him.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.286 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we have an excerpt.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.776 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, let's listen.

00:10:21.776 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JERRY WILLS: He said that I
was on another world, that it

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:90%
was outside of my universe.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to understand
how that's possible.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, there
are many universes,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and you've just passed
from yours into ours.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.055 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:43.055 --> 00:10:45.042 align:middle line:90%
So where is this universe?

00:10:45.042 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, it wouldn't do
me any good to even try

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:90%
to explain it to you.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I asked him how
I'd gotten there.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, apparently,
whoever they are

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.940 align:middle line:84%
had been very curious about
the nature of the universe.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
They tried to recreate
a model of the universe.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So he was talking about how
they were colliding particles,

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and somehow a
spark had occurred,

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:90%
and the spark didn't go away.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Instead, it started growing.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And as it grew, it started
accumulating and creating

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:90%
more of itself on its own.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It was quite large, and they
had created another universe.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:84%
They weren't planning
on doing this.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And it had evolved, and
it evolved quite rapidly.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I don't understand

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
this, because we think
the universe is billions

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.525 align:middle line:90%
and billions of years old.

00:11:41.525 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, where you
are, you measure time

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:90%
much differently.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Time is different
in every universe.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
telling me about this,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
they were really
very afraid that it

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.190 align:middle line:84%
was going to continue
growing, and it would just

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
overwhelm them, and then
what would happen to them?

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And what they had discovered
is that they were inside

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
of someone else's universe, just
like we were inside of theirs.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just layers and layers.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:84%
There's very little that
separates one from the other.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And they had learned that
life had started to populate

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.452 align:middle line:90%
throughout that universe.

00:12:19.452 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERVIEWER: They had made?

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:90%
They were fascinated by this.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Curious as can be how
this was possible.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And this doorway that
I had gone through

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.690 align:middle line:84%
was something that
they had put in place.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:84%
They had these doorways
throughout our universe

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:90%
in various places.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
They had been sending scientists
in there to study the universe,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
because this was a whole
new realm of science

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:90%
for them to explore.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they started
discovering life in there,

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.700 align:middle line:90%
well, they were pretty shocked.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, I'm not
the only person that'd

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:90%
ever come through that doorway.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
these doorways go

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to other places on this planet,
as well as to other planets.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that I can figure
is that moving from one point

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:84%
to another was outside
the dynamic of time

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:84%
altogether, that these doorways
are instantaneous passageways

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.424 align:middle line:90%
to other places.

00:13:13.424 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Well, and
that last statement.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Doorways that could
be instantaneous

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:84%
to other dimensions
placed around this planet.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Remember Lieutenant
Philip J. Corso.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:10%
In his book, "The
Day after Roswell,"

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:10%
and he goes into really saying
that the government has known

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:10%
about extraterrestrial
biological entities for a very

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:10%
long time, collected technology
that we have back engineered,

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:10%
and has a part in
that book where

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:10%
he lists nine
places on the Earth

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:10%
that our government understands.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Key points.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: That there
are what are called

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.060 align:middle line:84%
natural collapses of the
electromagnetic field,

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and that where any
electromagnetic fields do

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:84%
collapse, have a weakness,
things can come in that move

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:90%
magnetically in the universe.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that we are
dealing with intelligences

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that know how to provoke the
collapse of magnetic fields.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And then if you can go
to the speed of light,

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:84%
let's just say that we're
dealing with intelligences that

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.182 align:middle line:90%
can go at the speed of light.

00:14:21.182 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And one day we will.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Well, they
can go point to point.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And if Goode is
right at Harvard--

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:84%
he's been speculating this
for a couple of decades,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.900 align:middle line:84%
that we're not just a universe
with a trillion galaxies,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:90%
and that this is it.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:84%
That there could be
an infinite number

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of galaxies, an infinite
number of universes,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:84%
an infinite number
of dimensions.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And that part where
the voice is telling

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Jerry that they discovered--

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:90%
whoever the they is--

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that their universe has another
dimension that is encompassing

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
it, or another universe, and
they're encompassing this one,

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and we could be
encompassing another.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.840 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
you have this idea

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:84%
of those Russian dolls that
are all embedded in each other,

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:84%
that this cosmos could
be universes inside

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:90%
of each other going on and on.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
whole issue of why

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
is it that some people
have seen blazing

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:84%
white crosses in their life that
have saved them, or somebody

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:84%
is falling off of
a cliff and they

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
say it felt like Jell-O
came and lifted them up,

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.427 align:middle line:84%
there have been the
miracles of this planet.

00:15:42.427 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had calls
on "Coast to Coast,"

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Linda, where people are
ready to crash to a vehicle,

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:90%
and they go right through it.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: Yes.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Or over.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or over it.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: And abductees.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:90%
I've heard that so many times.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And I have an illustration
in my third book, "Glimpses

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of Other Realities,
Volume 2," where

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
a mother and daughter, and
the daughter is the abductee,

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:90%
and they are traveling on--

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:84%
she had already had
interactions since she

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.567 align:middle line:84%
was a teenager with
all kinds of ETs.

00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And they apparently
were trying to help her.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
help her survive.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it would have
been counterproductive

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
to the non-humans
and their effort

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.780 align:middle line:84%
to keep her alive
from disease if she

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:90%
would die in a car crash.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the way she analyzed it.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So she and her
mother are coming,

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're entering
the intersection,

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.932 align:middle line:84%
and they both see a car coming
at them at the same time.

00:16:36.932 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're done, right?

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:90%
They're supposed to be done.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: And she said, it was
as if their car rose vertically

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.960 align:middle line:84%
up and went over the car
that should have hit them,

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.890 align:middle line:90%
came down on the other side.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And both the mother and daughter
knew that something real

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:90%
had happened.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:90%
It had saved their lives.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But how many humans
go to other humans

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:90%
and tell stories like that?

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Because humans are so afraid
of ridicule from other humans.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.801 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about the
car that almost hit them?

00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:90%
What were they thinking?

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.697 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:12.697 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Did they-- were
they even conscious,

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:84%
or did they get a
blast of white light?

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:84%
Well, this now leads
to new work that

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
is being done by
a physicist named

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Campbell and some people
at-- literally at Caltech.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:90%
It was in February.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I spent an entire day with
a mathematician at Caltech

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and a friend of
Professor Campbell's.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about
all of this whole issue,

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:84%
are we living in a
simulated universe?

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Because this mathematician
that I talked to, they're are

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:84%
actually now trying
to come up with,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:84%
what are tests that
human scientists

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:84%
can do right now or through
the rest of this year and maybe

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:90%
next?

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.070 align:middle line:84%
They have to get collaboration
from other large labs

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:84%
internationally to do some of
the things they want to do.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:90%
But they are now--

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
there's so many people that are
intent on trying to test this,

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
because whether it is
a holographic universe,

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and a hologram is
the projector that

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:84%
is projecting
light and creating,

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Campbell thinks that we
don't even need the holography.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:84%
That we could have
another dimension that

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:90%
is projecting zeros and ones--

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:36.410 align:middle line:84%
literally, zeros and ones, which
would be minuses and pluses,

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that are programmed,
that are already

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.879 align:middle line:84%
programmed from
another dimension.

00:18:41.879 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What who's
programming this?

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: OK.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I asked Professor Campbell.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Is the projector in
another dimension God?

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good question.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: And he
said, well, if we're

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
in a cosmos that has an
infinite number of universes,

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:84%
which dimension would
be a top dimension?

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Where do you get
to a point if there

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
are all of these Russian dolls
of universes and dimensions,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
would there be any
one that would be top?

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you then
get to this discussion.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I myself have always thought
there's a divine field that

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:23.989 align:middle line:90%
is not matter at all.

00:19:23.989 --> 00:19:25.280 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy and a frequency.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's obviously
something out there.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: It produces all the
matter worlds that have all

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:84%
of the dimensions, which if
you take a chord of music--

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:90%
this helps me think about this.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.765 align:middle line:84%
And let's say that you
go middle C, E, and G.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:43.377 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hum it for us, Linda.

00:19:43.377 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>HOWE: I can't
do a chord for you.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.775 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you can.

00:19:45.775 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe I can.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I sing.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: But if we were in middle
C and Jerry's universe is E,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and there's another
universe dimension that's

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:84%
F, unless you could produce
the exact frequency of the E

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and the G dimensions
or universes,

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.350 align:middle line:84%
you're never even going
to be able to detect.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.600 align:middle line:90%
You will not know anything.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And they could be that close
as frequencies of music.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.800 align:middle line:84%
This is getting close to
what I think the reality is

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and what the
physicists talk about.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.861 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
ever think you would

00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:90%
be thinking about this today?

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Because when we grew up in
school, when you and I grew up

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:84%
in school, we thought of this
universe as the universe.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Hard facts.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:84%
How it was created,
that's debatable.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I still haven't got my
explanation for the Big Bang.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
But did you ever
think you'd be talking

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:90%
about a holographic universe?

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: The first
time that I ever

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.779 align:middle line:84%
heard this was on an airliner,
flying with Budd Hopkins.

00:20:51.779 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The late Budd Hopkins.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: Goes back to 1991.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was that
spring, a book came out

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.951 align:middle line:84%
called "The Holographic
Universe" by Michael Talbot.

00:21:01.951 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a matter of fact,
since you bring that up,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look
at that right now.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL TALBOT: University
of London physicist

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
named David Bohm, who's a
former protege of Einstein

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and a Stanford University
neurophysiologist named

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Karl Pribram.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And they worked independently.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Pribram was studying
memory, and found

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:84%
that there's evidence that the
brain operates holographically.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And Bohm was studying
subatomic physics.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And on the subatomic level,
the fabric of reality

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.496 align:middle line:84%
seems to possess properties that
are reminiscent of a hologram.

00:21:31.496 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you put those
two ideas together,

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that our brain seems
to be holographic

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and the universe
is holographic, it

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
suggests that maybe
it's compelling evidence

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that the universe may
be a kind of hologram.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.087 align:middle line:84%
Not that it's
literally a hologram,

00:21:43.087 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
but that it's a good metaphor,
or a way of understanding

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.420 align:middle line:84%
A hologram has an
unusual property.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:84%
If you take a piece of
photographic film that has

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
a holographic image
encoded in it,

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.314 align:middle line:84%
that means that you cannot see
the image with your naked eye.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:84%
You have to
reconstruct the image.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to shine
a laser through it.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an image
of a rose in the film,

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:84%
shine a laser through
the rose, you'll

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:84%
get a three-dimensional image
of the rose on the other side.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.910 align:middle line:84%
If you cut that film in
half, shine the laser

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.493 align:middle line:84%
through each piece,
you'll get a whole

00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:84%
rose out of each piece, which
is a very unusual property,

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.152 align:middle line:84%
and sort of boggles the
imagination at first.

00:22:13.152 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Cut it in four,
you get four roses.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.151 align:middle line:84%
Cut it in eight,
you get eight roses.

00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So the universe
as a hologram, it

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
means, as William Blake said
that quite literally, you

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:84%
could find the universe
in a grain of sand.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.416 align:middle line:84%
That every portion
of the universe

00:22:22.416 --> 00:22:25.040 align:middle line:84%
contains some semblance of the
whole, of the whole universe.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: But now he just
said, may not be literal.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Now the physics is moving
toward literal hologram.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:10%
And what is so interesting about
that 1991 experience with Budd,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:10%
we had both been
speaking at a conference.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:10%
This book, "The Holographic
Universe" had just come out.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's passed
on now, hasn't he?

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: He died the next year.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So he died in 1992, one year
after the book came out.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, gosh.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: And so it was
a discussion everywhere

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:90%
at that conference in 1991.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
When you ask, had I started
thinking about this,

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:90%
it goes back to there.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So Budd and I are talking
together on the airline,

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:90%
going back--

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Philly, and
he lived in New York.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And he leaned over
and he said, I'm

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:84%
going to tell you
something confidentially,

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:90%
at the time in 1991.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, Michael Talbot is
one of my abductee cases.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Who would have known that?

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: No.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew then, nobody
knew for a long time

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.275 align:middle line:84%
till I have started saying
this just recently on "Coast"

00:23:32.275 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and at Earthfiles, and
now with a show with you,

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:84%
That Budd was saying
about the discussion

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
he had with Michael Talbot,
that the entire book,

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.350 align:middle line:84%
"The Holographic Universe,"
was a telepathic download

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:84%
during his experiences and
interactions with non-humans.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:56.880 align:middle line:90%
And he told Budd.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't want
anybody to know this.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He never
wrote that in the book.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: No.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't want
anybody to know this,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
because then they won't
think the book is credible.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.312 align:middle line:84%
Because back in '91, it
was worse than any time.

00:24:10.312 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was woo-woo then.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: Exactly.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Today, that's what's so exciting
about all of these new papers

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and studies, that the
holographic universe is

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:90%
increasingly--

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to step out
and say, with testing,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:84%
we could learn in
the next year or two

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that the evidence is that we
are in a holographic universe.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Which leads, again,
to your question,

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:90%
who's doing the projecting?

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Could there be
multiple projectors

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:84%
between different
dimensions and universes?

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Is this cosmos teeming
with advanced life

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:90%
that could be doing this?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But Professor Campbell and
I both feel the same way.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
There is a divine
non-matter field,

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and that the key to
why this universe might

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
be as it is with a yin and
yang symbol as a metaphor,

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.780 align:middle line:84%
darkness in the light, light
in the dark, a kind of yin

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and yang, would be--
and this is his term.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Professor Campbell
thinks that this universe

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:84%
was made to be an entropy
reduction trainer for souls.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
talking about that,

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking of gnosticism
and Zoroastrianism, which goes

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.419 align:middle line:90%
back more than 2,000 years.

00:25:34.419 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm glad you're
pronouncing these words.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: Well, I tell you.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I recommend to everybody to
read about Zoroastrianism

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and gnosticism,
because in many ways,

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:84%
it may be the key to why
anybody simulated this universe

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:90%
And the idea is that this--

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.930 align:middle line:84%
when you have entropy,
it's energy winding down.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:84%
It's why this would
be a universe where

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:90%
death is the end of everything.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Stars, people, the universe.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.300 align:middle line:84%
But that there could
be many universes where

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:84%
time, the vector of time, goes
to the past, and that means

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:90%
there would never be death.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:84%
They would be universes
of immortality.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Why then would this be
an entropy reduction

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.200 align:middle line:90%
trainer for souls?

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And his-- and he's
talking as a physicist.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:84%
He says, I really do think that
what we are underestimating

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
is the importance
of the soul spirit

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:84%
as the whole key to everything
that is on this planet.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds biblical.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Well, it has to
do with the life force.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:84%
If, in fact, the
body containers,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.980 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking
about ETs, humans,

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:84%
anything that is organic
life in this universe,

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:90%
there is a life force.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the first law of
thermodynamics that physicists

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
live by, energy
cannot be destroyed.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:90%
It is always there, reforming.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So the soul spirit of any entity
would be the consciousness

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:90%
relationship to the projector.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting into
the minds of any creature

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:29.030 align:middle line:84%
in this universe would be the
interactor with the projector,

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and that the body
containers are what

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:84%
would take the soul and spirit
around in this universe.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But the whole point, the
bottom line to everything

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.880 align:middle line:84%
is trying to live with
compassion, with love,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:90%
with sharing.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Not hate and greed and jealousy.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And that the more jealousy,
the more hate, the more war,

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.990 align:middle line:84%
the faster the universe
runs down with entropy.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't that sound
like the work of Jesus

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and the same things he's trying
to impart on people then?

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: So one of the
things that he and I

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:84%
have talked about that
when I did a recording,

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I put this also in my news
website earthfiles.com,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and I raised the question,
why would there be avatars?

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And avatars would be
Christ and Buddha.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Why would there be avatars
in a simulated universe?

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And he had the most
interesting answer.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, if we are in a
Cosmos with a capital C,

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and the whole point
of all existence

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:48.730 align:middle line:84%
everywhere is to evolve
the soul spirit back

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:53.530 align:middle line:84%
toward the divine field, that
there would be dimensions where

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:90%
we might call them angels.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.369 align:middle line:84%
They would be higher
frequency, they

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:84%
would already have the
knowledge that we're

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to learn
in this universe,

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and that the whole cosmos would
be dedicated to evolving souls

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:84%
against entropy, which is the
winding down toward death.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Almost like the whole thing
is set up for soul training.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
think it has been.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: And if there
are, let's say,

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:84%
intelligences that
we might call angels,

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.280 align:middle line:84%
but they are just
advanced intelligences

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.100 align:middle line:84%
in another dimension,
and they want

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:84%
to help this universe dimension
and others where there's

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:84%
more entropy, they might come
periodically, try to share,

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:90%
look.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.950 align:middle line:84%
If you do unto others as you
would have them do unto you,

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:84%
where your soul will go
at the moment of death

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
will be another dimensional
frequency where you will not

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:84%
have the struggles that you
have in this matter world that

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.800 align:middle line:84%
was designed specifically
to train souls.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If all of
this is correct,

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and all these
multiverses are here,

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and we're all part of this
holographic or computer-staged

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:18.592 align:middle line:84%
cosmos, how did the
first one happen?

00:30:18.592 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Well, it's
a good question.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had an answer.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, you're talking
about how did infinity begin?

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My mother, one day--

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.060 align:middle line:90%
she's still going strong--

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:84%
when I asked her
about all of this,

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
how did it start, who's
God, what is this, Mom?

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:84%
She said, Georgie, it always
was and always will be.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So my question to you is,
maybe it was always there.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was no
creator or projector.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was just always here.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: I can't comprehend that.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nor can I. I asked
her the same question.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, Mom, I don't get that.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:90%
How could it always be?

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But I also don't
understand how something

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.370 align:middle line:90%
could be from nothing.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Well, come back
to the singularity.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:84%
If Jerry Wills had
an experience that

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.320 align:middle line:84%
was a real insight
into a real dimension,

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:84%
meaning that there is a
dimension that could create

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:30.600 align:middle line:84%
in a lab all of the
science to test and see,

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:84%
how can we make a universe
that will have life in it?

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that that was the
goal in the other dimension.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And they end up having
these ingredients going,

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and then it starts
going out of control,

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and they try to tamp it
in in that dimension.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's out of their control,
and we end up a universe

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.820 align:middle line:84%
in another dimension that
the act in that laboratory

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.380 align:middle line:84%
created this other dimension
that this universe is in.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Jerry said that that
came into his mind

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:09.030 align:middle line:84%
when the voice was saying
that when they saw a spark,

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:84%
they saw a spark of light,
and they were so shocked.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what if that is
what we call the singularity,

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and it was the moment in that
lab in another dimension that

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.770 align:middle line:84%
was out of control and ended
up creating this universe?

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is why the
male voice told Jerry,

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.870 align:middle line:90%
we know all about your universe.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:90%
We tried to stop it.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But what they were shocked
by was the fact that

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
within a short period
of time, because they'd

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:84%
been monitoring, because they
can move inter-dimensionally,

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:84%
how life began to evolve so
rapidly in this universe.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:84%
That to them is the profound
mystery in that dimension,

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and how life began to
evolve is a profound mystery

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:90%
to our own science.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I get back to my
office and turn on my computer,

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:07.500 align:middle line:90%
I control it.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm the one who is doing this.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:90%
What about this cosmos?

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Who's controlling
this if we are indeed

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:20.070 align:middle line:84%
in a simulated or
holographic universe?

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
There's still got to be
somebody behind it or something.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: That's that projector
in the other dimension that

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:84%
is a big mystery, but
there's another part of this.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Professor Campbell would
say, if in fact we don't even

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:84%
need the holographic
projector in light,

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and if there is a dimension that
has a stream of zeros and ones,

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.260 align:middle line:84%
it's already encoded,
all the ingredients

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.590 align:middle line:84%
to make this universe
came in in zeros and ones

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:54.700 align:middle line:84%
from a computer simulation,
and that that was designed

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:84%
specifically for
that fine edge that

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:01.180 align:middle line:84%
makes life possible in
this universe, that is

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.530 align:middle line:90%
another one of the mysteries.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Why is this universe so
finely tuned to support life?

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.719 align:middle line:84%
He thinks then that our
brain, that concept,

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:84%
a holographic functioning brain
in a holographic functioning

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:21.010 align:middle line:84%
universe, consciousness
then in this universe

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:90%
becomes the prime player.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And that might explain, when
you go into quantum mechanics

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're back down into quarks
and electrons and protons,

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:84%
where they have tried
to isolate and measure

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:40.330 align:middle line:84%
electrons and
leptons, they realize

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:84%
that as soon as
they try to measure,

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:84%
they're impacting
the subatomic level.

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:49.659 align:middle line:84%
And that has been described
over and over for decades.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But that would imply that
even if we're not aware,

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.550 align:middle line:84%
our minds constantly are
interacting with what

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.230 align:middle line:90%
we think of as matter.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But matter is mostly
energy and space.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Our hands don't go through it
because of Planck's constant.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, you, I, the
chairs, the studio, everything,

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.700 align:middle line:90%
it's energy in space.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And if the mind was made by this
other dimensional projector,

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.590 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:23.290 align:middle line:84%
If consciousness is the
main ingredient which

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:84%
ties into the reduction, the
entropy reduction soul trainer,

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that this whole universe
was made specifically

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:38.800 align:middle line:84%
to be this interaction between
consciousness, soul spirit,

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and trying to reduce
entropy as a measurement

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:46.660 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution of knowledge
in the soul spirit back out.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As quickly
as it was turned

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:84%
on, can it be turned off,
and poof, we're gone?

00:35:55.170 --> 00:36:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: I suppose if somebody
who's projecting or originally

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.390 align:middle line:90%
projected or in the lab--

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shut of the projector.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.080 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: But if Jerry is right,
if that is an insight, that

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:11.910 align:middle line:84%
means that was an experiment
that got out of control in one

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.600 align:middle line:84%
dimension created another
dimension in which we

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:84%
are the universe in it,
they can't shut us off.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:90%
They tried.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:84%
That means we're in
a universe that I

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:24.399 align:middle line:84%
don't think anybody
can shut down,

00:36:24.399 --> 00:36:26.190 align:middle line:84%
at least not at the
level of the projector.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's a good thing.

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: I hope so.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would science
ever get to the point

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:37.800 align:middle line:84%
where they can justify what this
kind of universe is all about?

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: That's where
all of these new

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:84%
tests over the rest of this year
and next year, they're really

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:84%
going to try to
get more data that

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.700 align:middle line:84%
is going to either say,
the holographic universe,

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:84%
this is it, this is
the answer, we're

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.550 align:middle line:90%
in a holographic universe.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And there will still be those
questions that you're asking.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Who's doing the projection?

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can they shut it off?

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: Yeah.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But how many layers of
projectors might there be?

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And the bigger question
is, if the divine field

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:17.500 align:middle line:84%
has no matter, is the alpha
to the omega has no beginning,

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.050 align:middle line:84%
as you were talking
with your mom,

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:25.360 align:middle line:84%
but produced all these universes
and dimensions in which

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.090 align:middle line:90%
there is a vector of time.

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
strange juxtaposition.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.590 align:middle line:84%
If you have a divine field
that goes from the alpha

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:39.320 align:middle line:84%
to the omega, and there
is no beginning or end,

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:84%
but it can produce frequencies,
and the frequencies can

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
be matter and light and
energy, and that they

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:57.140 align:middle line:84%
can exist like the chord
notes so that you could have

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:84%
an infinite number of
different frequencies

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and different universes
and different dimensions,

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.920 align:middle line:84%
you still have
that huge question,

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:13.220 align:middle line:84%
will the infinity continue
to keep expanding?

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:84%
This universe may
contract on itself

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:90%
or keep expanding forever.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.390 align:middle line:90%
That's still a debate.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, if all those
other universes

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:27.950 align:middle line:84%
are contracting or
expanding, the size of space

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.660 align:middle line:90%
almost becomes meaningless.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And you come back
to the interaction

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:37.830 align:middle line:84%
that once you are in the
whole realm of consciousness,

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and you can ask this question,
who are we, who are they,

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:53.160 align:middle line:84%
what is the projector, is there
an overarching God or divine

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:58.810 align:middle line:84%
field, and is the
whole goal of all of it

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.120 align:middle line:84%
training for these
souls to return

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.830 align:middle line:84%
to the divine field, what would
happen to everything if it

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:10.000 align:middle line:84%
occurred that all
souls chose willfully

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.070 align:middle line:90%
to go back to the divine field?

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Would that suddenly--

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.440 align:middle line:90%
[CLICK]

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.540 align:middle line:90%
--that would be the end?

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you look
at Genesis in the Bible

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:23.200 align:middle line:84%
as a template for what you've
been talking about today,

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and look at that, it
makes a lot of sense.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.640 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people
need to go back and look at that

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.450 align:middle line:90%
and read that.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: "In the beginning
was the Word" with a capital

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:90%
W. The Word is sound.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.610 align:middle line:90%
The Word is frequency.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.230 align:middle line:90%
"In the beginning was the Word."

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Without frequency,
we have no matter.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.400 align:middle line:90%
It's the presence of frequency.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And the frequencies,
for people who

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.130 align:middle line:84%
have studied crop
formations, for example,

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:90%
and you get into fractals--

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or moving
the pyramid blocks.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Well, that's
neutralizing gravity.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.400 align:middle line:84%
But the fractals,
when you look out

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.920 align:middle line:84%
into the universe and
the holographic universe,

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.440 align:middle line:84%
or even the universe
of consciousness,

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and you examine, how has
this universe evolved,

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and what do galaxies look like,
and what do energy systems look

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:84%
like in relationship
to each other,

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:21.520 align:middle line:84%
you find fractal
patterns everywhere,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.580 align:middle line:84%
as if there is some
sort of a template

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that everything in
this universe would

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:32.350 align:middle line:84%
evolve in cycles and spirals
and cycles and spirals.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And there comes one of the
more interesting discussions

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that I had with an
abductee once who

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.940 align:middle line:84%
said that he was
shown that we are

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.180 align:middle line:90%
in a cluster of 10 universes.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.140 align:middle line:84%
We haven't discovered the other
nine, that we exist in pairs.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Five pairs, 10 universes.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And we are in a universe
where electrons are positively

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.640 align:middle line:90%
charged and protons are--

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.970 align:middle line:84%
the electrons negative
and the protons positive,

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and go into the
universe next door,

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.100 align:middle line:90%
and it's exactly the opposite.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Everything is the opposite.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And that at the moment of death
in this universe, the tunnel

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that people have talked about,
he calls it a charge change.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a physics, that the soul
spirit has to change charge,

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and goes into this
other universe

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:27.100 align:middle line:84%
where the vector of
time goes to the past.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.780 align:middle line:90%
You can't break anything.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.940 align:middle line:90%
You can't destroy anything.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And everything in that universe
gets younger and younger

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and younger, and recycles
into this universe

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.640 align:middle line:84%
where entropy is in charge
and energy goes down.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And it raises a question
about, if in fact there

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:51.340 align:middle line:84%
are universes in clusters,
were they designed specifically

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:56.740 align:middle line:84%
for the recycling of matter
going through the universes

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and out of the
matter worlds, then

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:04.630 align:middle line:84%
would come other frequencies
where matter may not dominate.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:10%
And that may or may not be what
the so-called angelic realm--

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:17.360 align:middle line:10%
meaning the word angel,
angelo, messenger,

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.660 align:middle line:10%
it could be that the
angelic interactions

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.150 align:middle line:10%
with our planet
for centuries has

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:27.910 align:middle line:10%
been quite literally
intelligences

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:32.140 align:middle line:10%
in this whole layer of all these
dimensions and universes where

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.740 align:middle line:10%
they already understand
everything in the matter

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.240 align:middle line:10%
worlds.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to be
in the matter worlds.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they interact with the
matter worlds, trying to help.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.810 align:middle line:84%
We literally do
have helpers and we

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.510 align:middle line:84%
have messengers from
some of these dimensions

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:53.710 align:middle line:84%
where the zeros and ones
would still be at work,

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and information
and consciousness

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.360 align:middle line:90%
would all be interacting.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you are
freed from matter,

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:05.380 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of matter, which
is hard for the matter world

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.790 align:middle line:84%
to understand, then that
might be the angelic realms.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's where, when you
go back into biblical text

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and you talk Enoch saying,
two very tall beings

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:20.650 align:middle line:84%
with glowing faces came and
said they wanted to show him

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:22.900 align:middle line:90%
the seven levels of Heaven--

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which could be
part of these dimensions.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: Exactly.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Seven notes.

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Seven frequencies.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:28.931 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about Hell?

00:43:28.931 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Where was Hell-- where
does that fit into this?

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWE: Well, in
the Enoch story,

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:38.200 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons why the
Book of Enoch was knocked out

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.340 align:middle line:84%
of the assembly of the Bible
at the Council of Nicaea was

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:46.510 align:middle line:84%
because Enoch said that
these two tall beings--

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.950 align:middle line:90%
he thought they were angels.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They could have been
extraterrestrials today.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:10%
They had glowing faces.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:56.470 align:middle line:10%
In the second Heaven,
which in our discussion

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:57.770 align:middle line:10%
would be a second note--

00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:58.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Universe.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:03.710 align:middle line:10%
>>HOWE: --a second
frequency, evil

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:09.020 align:middle line:10%
was contained as if
punished, as if kept,

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.880 align:middle line:10%
that there was a second
Heaven dedicated just

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.464 align:middle line:10%
to encapsulating evil.

00:44:15.464 --> 00:44:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWE: Thank you.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.329 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great information.

00:44:19.329 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered
about whether we

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:25.490 align:middle line:84%
lived in a simulated
universe, and maybe we do.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.980 align:middle line:10%
Linda's work, of course,
you can watch on Gaia

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.280 align:middle line:10%
at "Truth Hunter," or go to
her website, earthfiles.com.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.090 align:middle line:10%
She's got great
information about stories

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.700 align:middle line:10%
like this and so many more.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
