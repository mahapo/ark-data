Through the years,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I discovered hypnosis, and
I realized that there was

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.840 align:middle line:90%
something to this.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people come to me
if they have an illness,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
or they just want to find out
something about themselves.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.550 align:middle line:84%
The whole aim of the session
is to regress the client

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and bring them to the
deepest level of trance,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and then access their
higher consciousness.

the planet today are actually

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.830 align:middle line:84%
back again from these lifetimes
in Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're really
back again now so we

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
can go through the
same thing again,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.375 align:middle line:84%
and we can do it differently
and finally release this trauma.

you so much for having me.

>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in being a hypnotist?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Well, I just started
out with a lot of problems,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.832 align:middle line:10%
so I wanted to fix
myself basically.

>>COSME: Mm-hmm.

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So you ended
up going to one?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: I did.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:10%
And I went through
like a-- at first

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to be a psychologist
when I wanted to fix myself.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:10%
And then through the years,
I discovered hypnosis.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that there
was something to this,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:10%
and that people could make
changes so much easier

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:10%
with hypnosis.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you fix yourself?

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I did.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Before I did hypnosis and before
I got into any of this stuff,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:90%
I was overweight.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.312 align:middle line:84%
I had all kinds of
fears and phobias.

00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You were overweight?

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Mm-hmm.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:10%
I had all kinds of issues.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.882 align:middle line:10%
So basically, I got
into this to fix myself.

00:01:53.882 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you a
smoker, too, by any chance?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: No.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I just had all
kinds of problems.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it works
for that, too, doesn't it?

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: It does.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, I fixed myself
not just through hypnosis,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:84%
but understanding
that my thoughts

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.220 align:middle line:90%
were creating my reality.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And once I understood that,
I could change my life.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how did the past
life regression come into this?

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So I wanted to
become a psychologist.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted to do.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But throughout my
college training,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I felt as if there
was something missing

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
when I went into the
field and I tried

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.203 align:middle line:90%
to use what I had learned.

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:24.003 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I felt almost as if
every single thing I learned

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
was a lie, because
none of the people

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:90%
ever seemed to get better.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I was working as an
intern at a halfway house

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:90%
for mentally ill people.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:10%
And my job was to give them
medication and counsel them.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And there were no
success stories.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some people
even got worse.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And I felt as
if the people were even

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:84%
being tested upon by the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, long story
short, I got into hypnosis.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I at first started
with past life regression,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:90%
lose weight, and quit smoking.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But right away, I could tell
that past life regression

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:90%
worked.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I delved deeper
into that method.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I first studied with
Dr. Brian Weiss.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:90%
And then I found--

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's one of the best.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: He is.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:90%
And he really is that sweet.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:90%
He's such a great teacher.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And then after having
studied with him,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:90%
I found Dolores Cannon.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was
one of the best.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:90%
I miss her.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:10%
She's fantastic.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And I worked my way up from
a level 1 to a level 3.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And then as a level
3 practitioner,

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I traveled around the world
with her daughter, Julia Cannon,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
assisting her in the classes
and teaching all over the world.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Julia
still puts on events

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:84%
after Dolores passed on
a couple of years ago.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And she keeps the
memory of her mother

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:90%
out there for the public.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: She does.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.230 align:middle line:84%
She does a very
good job of that.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about your clients.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I know we can't get into
specifics about who they

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:90%
are, but let's use first names.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about Jen.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So I needed
a subject on the spot,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
because I needed
somebody I could regress

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
to take this video submission
to my level 3 class, which

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:90%
was going to be in Orlando.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I live in Florida, so I
needed somebody right away.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
get somebody that

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a paying client, but
somebody that would volunteer.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
I asked my friend Jen.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that she was not into
any of this spiritual stuff,

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
because I had known
her for 10 years.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And every day after school
we sat at the playground

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:90%
and we talked.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I would try to
bring up some spiritual stuff,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:90%
and she was not into that.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So when I asked her, I
kind of regretted it right

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:90%
when I asked her.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, why
did I just ask her?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did I say?

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.920 align:middle line:90%
This is past life regression.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:90%
What is she going to say?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:90%
She's going to think I'm crazy.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Jen, would
you be my subject?

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.190 align:middle line:90%
I need a subject.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
You can find out
about your past lives.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You can even find out
who you really are,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:90%
your true purpose in this life.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you have any
physical issues,

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:90%
you can even heal your body.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me kind
of funny, and I thought,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:90%
oh, my gosh.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:90%
She's going to think I'm crazy.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Here I am talking about past
lives and doing this with her.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me and she
said, that's what you do?

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:10%
I've been looking for
something like this because--

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Cool.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Because she hadn't
told anybody, but she

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.613 align:middle line:84%
had this brain condition
called pseudotumor cerebri.

00:05:25.613 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: It's this
fluid that was

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:90%
wrecking havoc in her brain.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was causing
all kinds of swelling.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
She was working really closely
with this team of specialists

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:90%
at--

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that dangerous?

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like it.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
They told her that there
was a huge risk of a stroke.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And that if she wasn't
going to stay on this really

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
heavy-duty medication,
that she didn't really

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.870 align:middle line:90%
have a chance at all.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:90%
She was given about 20 years.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, Jen was only
32, and so she was devastated.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:84%
She said, Sarah, I will
definitely be your subject.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I've been so depressed.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.395 align:middle line:84%
I haven't told
anybody about this--

00:05:59.395 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, fantastic.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.753 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: --and I'm on
all these medications.

00:06:01.753 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And, of course, you
videotape all your sessions,

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:90%
and she was one of your first.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JEN: It was a tidal wave.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
It was an atomic-type
device that they set off

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:84%
in strategic places in
rifts under the ocean.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
They do have devices that
operated like submarines.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And they placed them, acting
as they were our friends.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.555 align:middle line:90%
And then the wave came.

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Tell me
about this wave.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JEN: At first, I
was with many others

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
on the beach looking at
where the water had gone.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.940 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't understand where
the water was pulling out from.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And fish were flopping, and
everyone was just standing

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:90%
around looking, wondering.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And then I saw it.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Out of the corner of
my eye, I saw the wave.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: You see the wave.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JEN: And it was massive.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:90%
It was the size of--

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:84%
it's just you've never seen
anything so big in your life.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was a rock
cliff in front of me.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And I begin to climb as fast as
I can climb while everyone just

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.663 align:middle line:90%
stands there frozen.

00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: What about
your daughter?

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JEN: She's not on the beach.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:90%
She's back at the palace.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.038 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: And what happens next?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JEN: I make it to the top.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I am still running and
running and running.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:90%
They want to keep me alive.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:84%
They want me to see
their power and how

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
they could destroy
everything, as they told me

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.355 align:middle line:84%
they would if I didn't
do what they wanted.

00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:90%
But I would not believe them.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I believed our numbers were
greater and we would win.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
My child was swept
into something,

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and the back of her head was
impaled onto something sharp.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
found her, face down

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
in the water with
something lodged

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:90%
into the base of her skull.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: So you found her.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:90%
When did you find her?

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JEN: That was the
first place I ran.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.719 align:middle line:90%
I knew where she was.

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I was able
to outrun it and nobody else.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they almost put me
in like a bubble or something--

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:84%
something that made me witness
it, but not really even get

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:90%
my feet wet.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah, that's
an actual session.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
That's not a
re-enactment, is it?

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: That's our
very first session.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And after this session, Jen went
back to her team of specialists

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Miami, and her tumor

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:90%
had completely gone away.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: She was completely
healed after that session.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you in shock?

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Well, yeah.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I was in shock.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.923 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you
know what you're doing.

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, to really see and
hear that these things work,

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:90%
it's got to be amazing.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: What we found out
was this information that she

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
had buried within
her subconscious

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
was so powerful that it
could help people heal.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And there have been people
that have actually healed just

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.413 align:middle line:90%
from hearing this information.

00:09:47.413 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've done
a great job doing it.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
You've got a similar client
after Jen that really

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.733 align:middle line:90%
went through the same thing.

00:09:54.733 --> 00:09:56.275 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: You would
call it tsunami.

00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Mm-hmm.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: And
the water came in,

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and it just pulled
everything out,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.330 align:middle line:90%
and there was really no warning.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I was with my baby,
but not my husband.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Why not your husband?

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:90%
What happened to your husband?

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.815 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER: I saw him.

00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:90%
He drowned.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:90%
I saw him pass me.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Did you see
that before you passed?

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER: I did.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:90%
I was struggling to--

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:84%
struggling to get my
head above the water.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But-- and I looked, and I
saw him floating past me,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:90%
and everybody and everything.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.232 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Everything.

00:10:35.232 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: There
was so much water.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:90%
I knew that there was--

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.295 align:middle line:84%
I just had to relax
and go with it.

00:10:42.295 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So you
just had to allow

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:90%
yourself to just go with it?

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER: Yes.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: From your
perspective now

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
after having left
that body, can you

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
see what happened
to your island?

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.055 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER: It's just gone.

00:10:57.055 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:84%
It was completely
covered, enveloped it,

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.980 align:middle line:90%
and it's just gone, sunken.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It just sunk.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Where was it?

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: Where
was it originally?

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I-- looking at a map now, I
would say in the South Pacific.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.808 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me a little
bit about that client.

00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: That client was
just another client just

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:84%
like Jen who also had no
previous knowledge of Atlantis

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:90%
or Lemuria.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I was uncovering
all this stuff with Jen,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
neither one of us knew anything
about Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:84%
We were both just as
surprised as one another.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Should be listening to
Coast to Coast radio.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, you
know, to be honest,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I had heard such different
stories about these places.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I had heard stories
about Atlantis

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
that sounded like Atlantis was
this beautiful society where

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.088 align:middle line:84%
people were so
advanced spiritually.

00:11:56.088 --> 00:11:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that
could be the case, too.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.755 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It could be.

00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It seems like Atlantis lasted
for thousands of years.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:84%
But I was just supposed to
report on the very end time.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
This interesting phenomenon
started happening in my office.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
As I was uncovering
these memories with Jen,

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
so many people started coming
to my office recounting deep

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.630 align:middle line:90%
under hypnosis--

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Similar things.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.783 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: These same things.

00:12:17.783 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
just a coincidence.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So I would ask my
other friends who

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:84%
also do Dolores Cannon's
method of hypnosis

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.680 align:middle line:90%
if this was the case for them?

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was an over resounding
no, this is not a coincidence.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
I was supposed

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to uncover this information
and share it with the world.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
heal Jen specifically?

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So the body
is just a messenger.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:84%
That's really what--
it's too bad we don't all

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:90%
understand this.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But when we get an issue
like an illness or a disease

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.350 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of pain,
it's just the body's way

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:90%
of sending us a message.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy when
you're going under hypnosis

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
this message is.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And once the
message is heard, it

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:84%
can instantly be
released and healed.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.067 align:middle line:84%
This is something that I hope
in the future we all understand.

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
does it take, Sarah,

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to put somebody
under via hypnosis?

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: For Dolores
Cannon's method,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:90%
it takes about five hours.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.083 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Five hours?

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: It's a
very long session.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intense.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It is quite intense.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:90%
But it's so thorough.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.010 align:middle line:84%
You can find out
anything about yourself.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And most people use
this to heal themselves.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does
it take to get them

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:90%
into the hypnotic stage?

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It's very, very easy--

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:90%
not very long at all.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.227 align:middle line:90%
Probably maybe 30 minutes tops.

00:13:33.227 --> 00:13:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 30 minutes.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And then once
they're in that mode,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:90%
you go for five hours with them?

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, the whole
process takes about five hours.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
in a QHHT session,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
you talk to the client for
about two, two and a half hours.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Then the actual hypnosis
part takes about two hours.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you notice a
difference in the two people

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:90%
personality-wise?

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, definitely.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's really
fascinating is QHHT, Dolores

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Cannon's method, is different.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that stand for?

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So it's Quantum
Healing Hypnosis Technique.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Dolores Cannon founded it after
four to five years of research.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's different than a
regular past life regression.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Because a regular
past life regression

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
is just regressing the
client under hypnosis

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:90%
to recall a different lifetime.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:84%
But QHHT, Dolores
Cannon's method,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
is different in that the aim--
the whole aim of the session

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
is to regress the client and
bring them to the deepest

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
level of trance, and then access
their all-knowing, all-loving

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
aspect of themselves-
the higher consciousness.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, you're
actually communicating

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.687 align:middle line:84%
with universal knowledge,
universal consciousness.

00:14:36.687 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She developed
this technique, didn't she?

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: She did.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote 17 books
after she developed it.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.307 align:middle line:84%
And that's the method I use
to write my books as well.

00:14:45.307 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to
remember interviewing her

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:90%
on our radio shows.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And she was just so calm
and collected, and really

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:90%
knew her stuff, didn't she?

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.623 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: She really did.

00:14:55.623 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
She's just such
an amazing person.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.832 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved with her?

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, like I said,
I was doing Dr. Brian Weiss's

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:90%
method first.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.018 align:middle line:10%
And I felt like--

00:15:05.018 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But who found Dolores?

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:10%
She found you, or you found her?

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: No.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find something
that I felt like was missing.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there was
something missing in my life.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:90%
So I talked to this psychic.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh, my gosh.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the easiest
reading I've ever done.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to do
Dolores Cannon's method.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard of her.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: And the psychic said--

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:90%
This is the easiest reading.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
work your way up,

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to do
really well in that method.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
You're even going
to write books,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to speak
about your information

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, man.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.670 align:middle line:90%
This psychic is terrible.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
She must have me confused
with somebody else.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
But actually, she
was pretty good.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
When Jen told you she was
a commander on an ET craft,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:90%
what did you think?

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.875 align:middle line:84%
There's something
wrong here or what?

00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And level with us here.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So after our very
first session that you just saw,

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:84%
it was so surprising
to the both of us.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:84%
In her higher
consciousness that I

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:84%
access as part of
a QHHT session,

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I asked them why they
showed us this lifetime.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
this is our mission,

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:84%
to uncover this information that
has been buried for thousands

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
years, to uncover it

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
all from the very beginning,
and to share it with the world

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:90%
because the world needs it now.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, Jen
and I were wanted

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
to work together again and
uncover this information.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So I told her higher self,
her higher consciousness,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:84%
let's start from the beginning,
the very beginning of the story

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.510 align:middle line:90%
that you want to share with us.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, and
here it comes, right?

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And I
thought it was going

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:84%
to be the beginning of
her lifetime in Lemuria

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:90%
where she was a child.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.585 align:middle line:90%
I figured we're going to start--

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wrong.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Definitely wrong.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
We didn't go to that
lifetime at all.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the second
session started out

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
where Jen's remembering
coming to Earth

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:84%
as an extraterrestrial,
crash landing on Earth

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:90%
for the very first time.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is somebody--

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:90%
just so you know--

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
who did not believe
in extraterrestrials.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
She had a much different
appreciation for them

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:90%
after this session.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when do you
think this crash occurred,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:90%
if you were to date it?

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: So it's so fascinating.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems
as if this is-- we

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:84%
have been told so
many different things

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:90%
about our history, our origins.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:23.640 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if there were
many extraterrestrial crashes,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:84%
all for the same purpose of
helping to seed this Earth.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it
crashed on purpose?

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.725 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: They
crashed on purpose,

00:17:30.725 --> 00:17:32.462 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
know it at the time.

00:17:32.462 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:90%
They were intentionals.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like Roswell--
that kind of situation?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: They were intentional
crashes from memories

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:84%
that my clients share when
they're deep under hypnosis.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:84%
They remember that what caused
the crash were their breathing

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%
The breathing mechanisms on
their crafts were failing.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:84%
All clients expressed
the same issue.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
forced to crash.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
They found out later after they
had left their life that it

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:90%
was an intentional crash.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it was
a one-way mission.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know it at the time.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On one of
our Gaia programs

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Matias De Stefano talked
about Atlantis and past life

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:90%
His show is called "Initiation."

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:10%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO:
The Atlantean people,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:10%
what we used to call
Khef, or Khefian.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:10%
They were the sons
of the first mixed

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:10%
between those people
coming from the stars,

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.880 align:middle line:10%
and those people from Earth.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Humans and the Aessir
that you may know,

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
like Anunnaki, were the
first ones to be engaged

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and to make a kind
of civilization.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So the first humans
created as we

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:84%
know them today were sons and
daughters of them in the Middle

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:90%
East.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
All the creation of Atlantis
was around 16,000 BC,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
in between 4,000 to 5,000
years before Atlantis

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:84%
began as a
civilization, the Aessir

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:11.040 align:middle line:84%
were testing to see if
their DNA from the stars

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
was able to be readapted
in this planet.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah, why do you
think Atlantis was so advanced?

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Oh, so glad you
asked me that question.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, the founder of Atlantis
was an extraterrestrial

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:84%
who crash-landed his ship in
the Utah area in a quarry.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Utah?

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.020 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Mm-hmm.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:10%
In a quarry.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:10%
You could probably still find
it because of the technology

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:10%
that they used.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:10%
And he took whatever
technology he could salvage

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:10%
from his ship-- it
wasn't that much,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:10%
and it wasn't enough for him
to contact his home planet.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
But he took this
technology, and he

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:84%
went through one of the
ancient transport devices,

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:84%
the stone circles that you
see at Stonehenge are what

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:90%
they used to use those for.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So he took his
technology, and he

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
went through this
ancient transport devices

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:84%
and went to where you
would call Atlantis now.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And when he arrived
there, he luckily

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:84%
found some leftover technology
from an earlier grouping

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle line:90%
of colonists.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why Atlantis is
so advanced, because it was

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial technology.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it mixed
with ETs and humans?

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: When the
founder arrived,

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:84%
he took those humans
that had been free

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
for thousands and
thousands of years

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and had a beautiful society, and
he created human hybrid slaves

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And he used them
to create Atlantis.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.730 align:middle line:84%
He made Atlantis in the image of
what he had on his home planet,

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.470 align:middle line:84%
because he couldn't
get back home.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't contact
his home planet.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to get back what
he had on his home planet.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:10%
I have so many clients
regress that go back

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.787 align:middle line:10%
to these other planets--

00:20:43.787 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they all go
right back to that point.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Or that point, yes.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:10%
And so some of my
clients that go back

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:10%
to these other planets,
or a parallel life

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:10%
that they experience, they
see that it's so advanced

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:10%
and it looks like Atlantis.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:10%
So there was a reason why
Atlantis looked the way it did.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had heard
mermaids may have

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:90%
originated from Atlantis, too.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Definitely.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
There were so many mermaids
on and near Atlantis

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
during this time before the last
founder arrived on Atlantis.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:84%
The Mer people and the
humans used to do trades,

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and it was a beautiful
society on Atlantis

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.950 align:middle line:84%
before this founder
came-- this last founder.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever have
a past life there, Sarah?

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I did have a
past life in Atlantis,

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:90%
which was really interesting.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.270 align:middle line:10%
Because as part of the
classes that I help teach,

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:10%
people practice on
me and regress me.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And one of the students
there was practicing on me,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and I was regressed
to a time period

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.020 align:middle line:90%
where I lived in Atlantis.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm told by
some hypnotherapist

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that I came from
Atlantis as well.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Most of the
people, believe it or not--

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did you know me then?

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I don't know.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.365 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:21:54.365 --> 00:21:55.865 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why
we know each other.

00:21:55.865 --> 00:21:56.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never know.

00:21:56.865 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Most of the people
walking the planet today

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:10%
are actually back again
from these lifetimes

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:10%
in Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Because after those
civilizations were destroyed,

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
there was so much karma, so
much trauma to be accounted for,

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that we needed to figure out
when we would come back again.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And the time is right now.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many
people around us

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.185 align:middle line:84%
today are triggered
by current events.

00:22:21.185 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's true.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell me the difference
between Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.055 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So Lemuria was founded
by another extraterrestrial who

00:22:29.055 --> 00:22:29.855 align:middle line:90%
crash-landed.

00:22:29.855 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A different person--
a different entity or whatever

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:10%
we call them, right?

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:33.020 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Totally different.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:10%
Mm-hmm.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:10%
But it wasn't advanced
with their technology,

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.720 align:middle line:10%
because they didn't
have the technology.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis was only advanced
with their technology

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.220 align:middle line:10%
because the founder
was lucky enough

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:10%
to have found some
ancient technology left

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:10%
from some other
extraterrestrials.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to use
that to create Atlantis.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But Lemuria was not advanced
in their technology.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
They were, however,
advanced spiritually.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they get
along with the Atlanteans?

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: From what I've
heard from multiple clients,

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:90%
the Atlanteans visited Lemuria.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
they visited Lemuria--

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: No wars there
or anything like that?

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: There was a war.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's what I heard.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:10%
So what happened was
Atlantis was dealing

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:10%
with a very deadly virus.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:10%
And this virus was wreaking
havoc on their land.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.388 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds
familiar, doesn't it?

00:23:20.388 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: There's a reason
why it sounds familiar.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of us are back
again wanting to use these

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:84%
triggers so we can finally
release this trauma

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:84%
after thousands and
thousands of years.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But the Atlanteans
had this virus,

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:90%
and it was a deadly virus.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And so many of my clients, when
they're deep under hypnosis,

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:84%
they'll recount that Atlantis
had this type of smog,

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't really
see the sun, not every day.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And the reason for
that was because they were

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.257 align:middle line:90%
burning the bodies in Atlantis.

00:23:49.257 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:90%
They had to.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: They had to.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So the Atlanteans
went to Lemuria

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:84%
because the Lemurians
had a type of immunity.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they were close
by to each other in proximity,

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:90%
weren't they?

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Well, not so much.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis, from what I've
learned from my clients,

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.930 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have spanned from
Europe to North America,

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.387 align:middle line:84%
and then from North
America to Western Africa.

00:24:11.387 --> 00:24:13.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Atlantis was the
bigger continent, right?

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It was humongous.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look at Atlantis
from my clients' perspectives

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:84%
as they're leaving
their bodies, they

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.920 align:middle line:84%
would say that the
globe and the map

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:90%
looked so different back then.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Because there was water and
coastlines in different areas.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
The North Africa area was almost
like a lone sandbar that would

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:90%
go from the Sphinx to Atlantis.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx was the
outpost of Atlantis,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't created
by the Atlanteans.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.398 align:middle line:84%
It was actually created from
an earlier group of colonies.

00:24:41.398 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's much
older than people think.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Much older
than people think.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
most original things

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:90%
that we have on our planet.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Sarah, tell us
where exactly was Lemuria?

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Lemuria was located
in the South Pacific.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:90%
It encompassed Easter Island.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And it stretched
all the way to South America.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.452 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: South Pacific, huh?

00:25:01.452 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And what
was interesting--

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bali Hai.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
was that the Lemurians

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.690 align:middle line:90%
had a special type of immunity.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
They would have issues
with childbirth and pain,

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
but they wouldn't get
viruses or get sick.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Atlanteans had really
high developed technology.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So they were spying
on the Lemurians

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:90%
because they noticed this.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
They noticed they had a
specific type of immunity.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:10%
But the Lemurians couldn't
give this immunity to anybody.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
It was a gift from the stars,
from their star ancestors,

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:90%
from their star people.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:10%
So they couldn't
give it to anybody.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But the Atlanteans demanded
this technology, this immunity.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And when they
wouldn't agree, they

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.820 align:middle line:84%
took the princess as a
prisoner, and killed everyone

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:90%
by using atomic-type devices.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And they created this
massive tidal wave

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:90%
that completely sunk Lemuria.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And so many of my clients
would come in and share stories

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:90%
about this horrific wave.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah, on Gaia's "Open
Minds with Regina Meredith,"

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Tom T. Moore talked about many
of his past lives in Atlantis.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.535 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

00:26:10.535 --> 00:26:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TOM T. MOORE: Did I ever
have a life on Lemuria?

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:90%
And Theo said, ah, Tom.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, when he says that, I'm
going to hear something.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, you helped
destroy the continent.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So it turned out that I was
a religious leader in one

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.320 align:middle line:90%
of the five countries.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And we really were
getting warlike.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And we had developed the
equivalent of the hydrogen

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:90%
bombs, OK?

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we didn't think
these other two countries

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.030 align:middle line:90%
had developed hydrogen bombs.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I encouraged them,
oh, yeah, let's go ahead

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:90%
and attack them.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:90%
And so we did.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But they did have,
and they retaliated

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:90%
with their own hydrogen bombs.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.838 align:middle line:84%
So that's what broke
that continent up.

00:27:05.838 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Well--

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: And it took me 85 or
87 lives to balance that one.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I consider it my
worst life on Earth.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Mm-hmm.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we, all have screw-ups.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yeah.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was the major one.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So you're
saying 7,500 years ago,

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:90%
this would have occurred?

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORE: Yes.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And so
if you're saying--

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
then what would the implication
have been with 170-foot tidal--

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%
essentially, rise of
sea level at that time?

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: Again-- and this
is why-- people say, well,

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
why don't we have
records of all this?

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:45.280 align:middle line:84%
It's because we've had three
times in our history 160, 41,

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and 170 feet where the oceans
rose and drowned people

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
wiped out cities--

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:84%
all the cities, towns,
villages that were

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:84%
on the coasts of the world,
and all their records

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.117 align:middle line:84%
and everything were
all completely--

00:28:01.117 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Buried in mud.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORE: --completely
wiped away.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.278 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Mm-hmm.

00:28:05.278 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Regina is looking
at Tom T. Moore going,

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about this story.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.715 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of him?

00:28:11.715 --> 00:28:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, it's interesting
when he talked about the bombs.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.560 align:middle line:84%
That was really
interesting, because that's

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:84%
what the Atlanteans
used when they blew up,

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.860 align:middle line:90%
or when they sent--

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got that
corroboration and knowledge.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: But put it
in rifts in the ocean

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:90%
to create that huge tidal wave.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tsunamis.

00:28:27.685 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: The tsunami.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, which is fascinating,
because I never researched

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:84%
anything, and I haven't
seen Matias either.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:84%
All my information I get only
from my hypnosis subjects.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many clients have
you put under, basically--

00:28:43.695 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, gosh.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and they've talked
about Atlantis and Lemuria?

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.937 align:middle line:90%
Many of them?

00:28:48.937 --> 00:28:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Multiple clients.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know how
many, but it was so many

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.920 align:middle line:84%
that I knew there was a reason
why they were all coming.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it conceivable,
Sarah, that most of us

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:84%
originated from those
areas years ago?

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:90%
And we're talking, what?

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.640 align:middle line:90%
50,000 years ago, maybe?

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: It seems as if Lemuria
was about 25,000 years ago.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if we
originated from these places.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.040 align:middle line:84%
But most of us have had
lifetimes in these places

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:84%
during these times,
especially the end of times

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.200 align:middle line:90%
during these civilizations.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't
we get the technology

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.697 align:middle line:84%
and go find these continents
at the bottom of the ocean?

00:29:30.697 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I'm sure you can.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Because there is the
Bermuda Triangle,

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:84%
where the capital
of Atlantis was.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And some of their technology
is still located down

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:90%
underneath the ocean.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:90%
But Lemuria was completely sunk.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that why we
have problems in Bermuda

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:90%
at the Bermuda Triangle?

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.210 align:middle line:84%
There's something there,
some kind of energy force

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.797 align:middle line:84%
that is still affecting
boats and planes?

00:29:51.797 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Definitely.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.820 align:middle line:84%
The energy can
still be felt. Even

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.860 align:middle line:84%
if you go in the ocean
near these places,

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.610 align:middle line:90%
the energy is still there.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you were
there, what was your role?

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So when I lived in
Atlantis, my role was a judge.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were a judge?

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: My role was a judge.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Because during this time,
there was the deadly virus

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:12.100 align:middle line:90%
in Atlantis.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:84%
But they had
developed a vaccine.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And at first it seemed like
this vaccine was a huge success.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.610 align:middle line:90%
It was like a slit in the arm.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is getting scary.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I know.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:90%
And animal DNA was placed in.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And then a putty-like
substance would go over it.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a huge
success that everybody

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.020 align:middle line:84%
was able to come out
of the quarantine.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:90%
People stopped dying.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.020 align:middle line:84%
There were no more
bodies being burnt.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was
extremely happy

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.250 align:middle line:84%
until the first set
of babies started

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:84%
being born with
horrific side effects

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.040 align:middle line:90%
from these vaccine side effects.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And so the babies
were born with different animal

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:90%
parts.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Like some people had animal
DNA that looked like cat-like--

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.380 align:middle line:90%
they had cat-like features.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They are
called what, chimeras,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:84%
when they're half animal, half
human, or something like that?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.635 align:middle line:84%
And they had all
different kinds of issues.

00:31:01.635 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So human beings
would be born with animal body

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:90%
parts--

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: You can still--

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --like a pig snout
or something like that?

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Not a
pig snout, per se.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But like animal parts like
cat-like features, gills,

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:14.990 align:middle line:90%
tails, extra nipples.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:90%
You can still--

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On humans?

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: You can still
see this running slightly

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:90%
through our genes even today.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:20.967 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:31:20.967 --> 00:31:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: You can see people born
with gills and extra nipples,

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.722 align:middle line:90%
and everything like that.

00:31:24.722 --> 00:31:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So science that
went awry at that time.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: The science
went awry, unfortunately.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you were a judge.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.298 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I was a judge.

00:31:31.298 --> 00:31:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And my job was to
decide who would stay

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:90%
and who would go in Atlantis.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you say go, go where?

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So what I was told
when I was working in Atlantis

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.862 align:middle line:84%
was that these people,
these children that

00:31:43.862 --> 00:31:45.820 align:middle line:84%
were born with these side
effects, some of them

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.130 align:middle line:84%
would grow up and they
would become violent.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were taken
to this other island

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:84%
where they were given
food and different care.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.363 align:middle line:84%
And my job was to decide
who would stay in Atlantis--

00:31:56.363 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or who would
go to this island.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Or who
go to this island.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.100 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that--

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:84%
You played the role
of God, didn't you?

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I think I have
some karma to account for.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So here I am back again
trying to help people.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know that
they were being killed

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.890 align:middle line:90%
when they got to the island.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was killing them?

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.583 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: So unfortunately--

00:32:14.583 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
didn't know this?

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Uh-uh.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I would send thousands
of people to this island.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were-- it was
actually a death camp.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:90%
They were being killed.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.797 align:middle line:84%
They were being
slaughtered, basically.

00:32:27.797 --> 00:32:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And I can't tell
you how many clients I've

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.920 align:middle line:90%
had that remember this island.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.988 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if it
was ever used for what

00:32:34.988 --> 00:32:36.280 align:middle line:90%
it was supposed to be used for.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did
you find this out?

00:32:37.905 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:90%
In hypnotherapy on yourself?

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So I found out that
I was a judge because somebody

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.690 align:middle line:90%
was regressing me.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it
was so fascinating

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.020 align:middle line:90%
just to be in Atlantis.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea why I even
lived in the Florida Keys.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I live
in the Florida Keys

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:84%
is because I'm the closest
point to where I actually

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:56.800 align:middle line:90%
died in that lifetime.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.715 align:middle line:90%
Because the island--

00:32:57.715 --> 00:32:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did you die?

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: --is located so close.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.390 align:middle line:90%
I died from a heart attack.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.505 align:middle line:84%
My heart gave out, because
I couldn't handle--

00:33:03.505 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From the stress.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:06.038 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: --what happened
to these people.

00:33:06.038 --> 00:33:08.020 align:middle line:90%
I was so upset when I found out.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to tell as
many people as I could.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
But at that point,
it was too late.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:90%
I just died of a broken heart.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:15.818 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many of
these people did you

00:33:15.818 --> 00:33:17.050 align:middle line:90%
sentence to die not knowing?

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Probably thousands.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And children
were being taken away

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.380 align:middle line:84%
from their parents who have
these horrible side effects.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is Sasquatch,
Bigfoot, the remnants

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:30.368 align:middle line:84%
of some of those
entities and beings?

00:33:30.368 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: That's quite possible.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.660 align:middle line:84%
But I've also heard
that Sasquatch actually

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.170 align:middle line:84%
is more native to the
Earth than human beings.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Human beings have been--
according to my subjects

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.690 align:middle line:84%
under hypnosis, human beings
have been brought here

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:44.945 align:middle line:90%
from other planets.

00:33:44.945 --> 00:33:45.745 align:middle line:90%
We're directly--

00:33:45.745 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or seeded.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:84%
We are directly linked
to extraterrestrials.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So our origins are
actually from the stars.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
eradicate this virus?

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: So they never did.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.460 align:middle line:90%
They never eradicated it.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.530 align:middle line:90%
At this point--

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are lessons
for us to learn today,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:90%
aren't there?

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, at
first it seemed

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:84%
like they could go
back into trials

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and they tried again
with the vaccine.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.770 align:middle line:90%
But it still didn't work.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:84%
It still created
horrific side effects.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, according
to some of my clients,

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:90%
the third try was the charm.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.929 align:middle line:84%
But see, what we really
need to understand

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.630 align:middle line:84%
is that these children that
were born with the side effects,

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:90%
they had major, major abilities.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So what is considered
a side effect--

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.960 align:middle line:84%
even now, if you think about
what's going on in our life now

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.849 align:middle line:90%
were side effects--

00:34:32.849 --> 00:34:33.932 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were gifted?

00:34:33.932 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: They were
extremely gifted.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.120 align:middle line:84%
If you look at our life
now, with like, say, ADHD

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that, that might

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:42.810 align:middle line:90%
be considered a disability.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.780 align:middle line:84%
But according to clients
deep under hypnosis,

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.580 align:middle line:90%
this is not a disability at all.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.159 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge
ability, that people

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:52.770 align:middle line:84%
with ADHD and
different disabilities

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:90%
are often underlooked.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Because a person with something
like a disability like

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.870 align:middle line:84%
ADHD, not trying to
belittle disabilities.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:90%
But somebody with ADHD can--

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.240 align:middle line:84%
if a teacher is saying,
look at this box.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.348 align:middle line:84%
The child can see like outside
the box, around the box, even--

00:35:09.348 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have
incredible memory.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:11.340 align:middle line:90%
They can--

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: They can focus--

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --read the phone book
and remember phone numbers.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Of course, do they make
phone books anymore?

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know that.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Just like the savants.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.020 align:middle line:84%
They obviously have
an ability, and it's

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.400 align:middle line:90%
considered a disability.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.280 align:middle line:84%
They've actually opened
a channel in their mind.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:90%
That's such a huge ability.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So this was happening
in Atlantis.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.550 align:middle line:84%
They started to realize
that the children that

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.622 align:middle line:84%
were born with the vaccine side
effects had amazing ability.

00:35:35.622 --> 00:35:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
percent of people

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.820 align:middle line:84%
were being born
with side effects?

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Most of the people
had some slight side effect.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So they really screwed up when
they came up with that vaccine?

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: It was unbelievable
what happened in their society.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They cured the virus--

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: They cured the virus.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --but created
a different issue.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.310 align:middle line:84%
But we were supposed
to learn from this.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything in this universe
has a divine purpose.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:02.760 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed to understand
not to be so judgmental,

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and to understand that there's
a divine presence in everything.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.358 align:middle line:84%
So the abilities that
these children had

00:36:08.358 --> 00:36:10.650 align:middle line:84%
were actually that these
children with the side effects

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.150 align:middle line:90%
could read crystals.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:90%
They could tap into ley lines.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And they could find out all this
information that regular people

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.105 align:middle line:84%
that were untouched by
these side effects couldn't.

00:36:20.105 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really important

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.340 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
there are so many things

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:27.240 align:middle line:84%
considered disabilities that
are actually abilities even now.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.780 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the lessons I think
we need to learn from Atlantis.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have we learned them?

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.373 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I think we're learning.

00:36:33.373 --> 00:36:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I think right now we're
doing a great job.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.210 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we've come so
full circle to where we are now

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.020 align:middle line:90%
means that we're evolving.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:84%
This is exciting, because we're
doing things so much different

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:90%
now than we did in Atlantis.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Before, in Atlantis, we
just killed everybody.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.100 align:middle line:84%
We just decided that
if you're different,

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:90%
you don't belong here.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.880 align:middle line:90%
But now we're learning.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.440 align:middle line:84%
We're developing our compassion
right alongside our technology.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I think we're exactly
where we're supposed to be,

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.270 align:middle line:84%
at least that's what my clients
deep under hypnosis have said.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
your latest book, Sarah.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.633 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: My latest book is
called "A Hypnotist's Journey

00:37:08.633 --> 00:37:10.500 align:middle line:90%
to the Secrets of the Sphinx."

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.180 align:middle line:84%
The one I was just
talking about is

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.222 align:middle line:84%
called "A Hypnotist's
Journey to Atlantis."

00:37:14.222 --> 00:37:15.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, when
you write these books,

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:10%
do you go into a
different mode in order

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.900 align:middle line:10%
to get the information?

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So what's
different about me

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:90%
is I don't research anything.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And I also only use
clients or subjects

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.220 align:middle line:84%
that don't know
anything consciously

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:90%
about any of this information.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:35.200 align:middle line:84%
That's really the only way I
can keep this information valid.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So I can't use somebody that
already has previous knowledge

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.660 align:middle line:90%
of any of this stuff.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able
to trust the information.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matias talks about
the possibility of Atlantis

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:90%
and how it just fell apart.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Atlantis has
this shift in their politics

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that was not connecting everyone
as one, but to rule them all

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.680 align:middle line:90%
and be together.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:06.900 align:middle line:84%
By this control that they tried
to hold around the planet,

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.440 align:middle line:84%
they forgot how to be
connected to the planet.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So the planets start to
protect themself-- itself--

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.560 align:middle line:84%
from the consciousness
of civilization.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So that made that
every node as a flower

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:27.930 align:middle line:84%
start to close and go
down to the inner world.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So the inner world start to
hold the energy of the planet,

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and the outer world was not
able to get that information

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.050 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And that made that
all the books melted.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It created a new heat era that
the planet-- the Ice Age ended.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And then all this water that
was held into the libraries

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.650 align:middle line:84%
start to go out from
the Northern Sea,

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:59.090 align:middle line:84%
from the Baltic Sea,
from the Bering Sea.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:03.680 align:middle line:84%
All this water started to
come down to the oceans.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
mostly remember.

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And that brought a war--

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
a war in between colonies to see
which one would be the next one

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:90%
to rule the world.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Atlantis
made-- blew up

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.480 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids of
some other places,

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:84%
so they couldn't
have the control.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So by good politics,
Egypt was one

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:38.180 align:middle line:84%
of the only colonies that
allows Atlantean people to come

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.900 align:middle line:90%
and not fight them.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they recreated
this civilization like Atlantis

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.960 align:middle line:90%
in the River Nile.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What lessons
can we learn, Sarah,

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.120 align:middle line:84%
from the Atlanteans
and the Lemurians?

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I think that so many of
us walking the planet right now

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:84%
have memories of this,
and we're not alone.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But I think what we
can learn is really

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.910 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we can
develop our technology right

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:84%
along with our compassion and
our ability to communicate

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.950 align:middle line:84%
with one another,
and to understand

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:14.150 align:middle line:84%
how to balance ourselves with a
masculine and feminine energy.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Even what he was talking
about with Atlantis

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.887 align:middle line:84%
and the control,
the domination, I

00:40:19.887 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:84%
think that's something that
we're starting to understand

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and trying to move
through, where we're

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to rebalance
our society right now,

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and not just be one
side or the other.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Because in Atlantis,
they thought

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.520 align:middle line:84%
they could control basically
by keeping knowledge

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.690 align:middle line:90%
from the people.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And people are really so
powerful, the true origins

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.220 align:middle line:84%
of humanity has
really been suppressed

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.630 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And people are so
powerful and so creative,

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.120 align:middle line:84%
if they really understood
who they really

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.090 align:middle line:84%
were, they would have a much
different understanding of what

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.560 align:middle line:90%
they could do with their lives.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah, they say
that history repeats itself.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Are we going through
the same things

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:84%
that they did back
thousands of years ago?

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Luckily, it's
not exactly the same.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But we're going
through a lot that's

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:08.510 align:middle line:90%
definitely triggering us.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people that do remember

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:84%
having a past life
in Atlantis that

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.130 align:middle line:84%
feel extremely triggered
by what's going on now.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
part of them that

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:20.180 align:middle line:84%
feels as if they've
done this before,

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't quite
work out very well.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.835 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that we're
doing so much better.

00:41:24.835 --> 00:41:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they get a
second time-- another chance?

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, karma
is not a punishment.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:30.382 align:middle line:84%
Karma is just a chance
to do things differently.

00:41:30.382 --> 00:41:31.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It can be a punishment.

00:41:31.715 --> 00:41:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It can be.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're an evil
person, karma can bite you.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: But really, we
have this second chance.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.990 align:middle line:84%
We're all back again so we
can do things differently.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're really
back again now, so we

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.160 align:middle line:84%
can go through the
same thing again,

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and we can do it
differently, and finally

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.970 align:middle line:90%
release this trauma.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Because this trauma was
so great for all of us.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.560 align:middle line:84%
We had to find a
way to release it

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.630 align:middle line:90%
so that we could move past it.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you
continue to see clients,

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:02.810 align:middle line:84%
are you shocked by some of
the things they tell you

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.580 align:middle line:90%
under hypnosis?

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I wish I
could be shocked, but--

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore?

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I think
the biggest thing--

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.330 align:middle line:84%
the biggest message
that I keep hearing

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.550 align:middle line:84%
from different
higher consciousness

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.940 align:middle line:84%
is just that it's really time
for us to understand who we are

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and why we're here,
and to understand

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.900 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of the universe.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And the secrets of
the universe really

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.050 align:middle line:84%
are that the truth of everything
is that life is just a game.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And that this game has
been going on for longer

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.550 align:middle line:84%
than human beings
can fully understand

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.990 align:middle line:90%
in the aspect of time.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:84%
We're all just this part of an
ancient grouping of beings that

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.050 align:middle line:84%
have traveled from
planet to planet to see

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.540 align:middle line:84%
what the next will bring,
so that we may never

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.540 align:middle line:84%
stop evolving, and we
never have to be alone.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Life might be a dream,
but we want-- and a game.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.290 align:middle line:90%
But we want to win it, don't we?

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.187 align:middle line:90%
Let's win this game, George.

00:42:52.187 --> 00:42:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get your book, Sarah?

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: They can
get it on Amazon.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They can get it
in Audible, also.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
your website?

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.502 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME:
Theholistichypnotist.com.

00:43:01.502 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And you enjoy
doing what you're doing?

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.585 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: I have a passion
for doing what I'm doing.

00:43:05.585 --> 00:43:07.775 align:middle line:84%
I really want to help people
understand who they are

00:43:07.775 --> 00:43:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and why they're here.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
clients come to you,

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.592 align:middle line:84%
what makes them come to
you in the first place?

00:43:12.592 --> 00:43:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: A lot of
people come to me

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:16.100 align:middle line:84%
if they have an issue
like an illness,

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.670 align:middle line:84%
or they just want to find out
something about themselves.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:20.920 align:middle line:10%
Because it's so easy
when you go deep under

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.470 align:middle line:10%
hypnosis to really
focus in on yourself,

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:25.840 align:middle line:10%
and find out so many
things about yourself

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.740 align:middle line:10%
and heal your body.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we had
more time I'd say,

00:43:28.282 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:84%
put me under and
let's see what I say.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: How do you
know I didn't already?

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe you did.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Sarah, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Thank you very
much for having me.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing story
of how people under hypnosis

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.260 align:middle line:10%
talk about their past lives.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:10%
And in this
particular case, they

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:10%
went back thousands of years.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
