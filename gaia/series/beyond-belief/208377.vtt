>>BEN FUCHS: When
we are diseased,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.822 align:middle line:90%
we are short circuiting.

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:15.280 align:middle line:84%
We're short circuiting
at the level

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:90%
of the tissues and the organs.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're short circuiting,
most fundamentally,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.950 align:middle line:90%
at the level of the cell.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:84%
The good news is we don't
need medical intervention

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:90%
to do what the cell needs.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:84%
The cell only
needs three things.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be fed.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be oxygenated.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And it needs a clean
place to do its work.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.537 align:middle line:90%
Love is curiosity.

00:00:34.537 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship between
love and curiosity in the sense

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:84%
that when you're curious about
something, you're showing love,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.578 align:middle line:84%
and when you love something,
you're curious about it.

Natural Pharmacists from

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:10%
Fuchs, I call him
the rogue pharmacist,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:10%
challenges modern
pharmaceutical practices

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:10%
and their toxicity in the body.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Hello, rogue pharmacist.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Hello, George.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you again.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we call
you the rogue pharmacist?

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Because I am a rogue.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Pharmacy has a reputation
for being very conservative

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:90%
and very orthodox.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:10%
And what I love about
pharmacy is the idea

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:10%
that you can use modalities
from outside the body

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.660 align:middle line:10%
to adjust the
inside of the body.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.577 align:middle line:10%
And of course, what is
the most powerful thing

00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:10%
that we do every day
on a regular basis that

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:10%
comes from outside the body
that changes inside the body?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
We do it three
times a day or more.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:90%
We eat.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.872 align:middle line:90%
So to me--

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We should eat.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.788 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: We should eat.

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Or once, twice,
three times a day.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
The point being,
when we eat foods,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
we adjust our
bodies in a way that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
is akin to pharmaceuticals, but
much kinder and much gentler.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So I consider myself
a rogue pharmacist

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
because I work on how we can
use things from outside the body

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:84%
to interact with the inside
of the body for our benefit,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.348 align:middle line:90%
but not pharmaceuticals.

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
When most people
think of drugs, they

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:90%
think of pharmaceuticals, right?

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.862 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But that's only been
the last 150 years or so,

00:01:58.862 --> 00:02:01.850 align:middle line:84%
or 170 years or so, so since the
advent of modern pharmacology,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:90%
since aspirin came about.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Before aspirin and before
organic chemistry, which

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
is about the 1850s,
1840s, the pharmacist

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
had a mortar and pestle,
and he'd be grinding herbs,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
or he'd be tincturing
herbs, or they'd

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.282 align:middle line:90%
be making homeopathic remedies.

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:17.448 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what you do.

00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's
what I do, exactly.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a rogue pharmacist
only in the sense

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
that today when we
think of pharmacy, we

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:84%
think of the
pharmaceutical companies.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But really from a
traditional standpoint,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm a traditional pharmacist,
not a rogue pharmacist.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like how they
call herbal medicine,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and nutritional medicine, and
even homeopathic medicine,

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:90%
or energy medicine alternative.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, to me the
pharmaceutical version

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:84%
of medicine should
be the alternative.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And we should be using foods,
and we should be using plants,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and we should be
using mind power,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and we should be using energy
medicine as our primary source

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:90%
of medicine.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I'm a rogue
pharmacist, but in my head,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.532 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing the orthodox
and traditional pharmacy.

00:02:57.532 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did you
become a pharmacist?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because
I loved chemistry.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.722 align:middle line:84%
I was one of those kids
that had a chemistry set.

00:03:02.722 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I had one too.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It was fun to see how--

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was into
biology, chemistry.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dissecting frogs.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.258 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's exciting
when you're a kid.

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was always fascinated
with the brain and the mind,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and I was always curious
about how chemistry worked

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.432 align:middle line:84%
with the brain and how our
perceptions were really

00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
based on chemical reactions
that were occurring

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:90%
in our nervous system.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And so when I was a--

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
when I went-- considering
going to pharmacy school,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:90%
I considered studying how food--

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
because I was always interested
in food and nutrition,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
how food and nutrition interact
with the body via the brain

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and how our thoughts,
and our perceptions,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and our mental health or
a lack of mental health

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:84%
was related to the
kind of foods we eat

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of
nutrition we intook.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I often
wonder, George, we

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:84%
live in this violent society,
and there's all this crime,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and people are depressed,
and there's craziness,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:90%
if you read--

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anxiety.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: All of this stuff.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
How much of that do you think
is related to the kind of foods

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:90%
we're eating?

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe some.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe some.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: We know that--

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can't rule it out.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Excitotoxins.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:84%
We know that food's, not only
these days don't provide us

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:84%
with nutrition,
George, they actually

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:90%
deprive us of nutrition.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it costs us
nutrition to process the foods.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And the foods don't
provide the nutrition,

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
so we become more and more
deficient the more and more

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:90%
we eat.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I
traveled from St. Louis

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
to Boulder to do this
program, I have not

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
taken all my supplements that I
normally take on a daily basis.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:90%
I feel guilty about it.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: How do you feel?

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.395 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel low-- less energy?

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Do you feel anything?

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not really.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.195 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think one
day is going to do that.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Do you feel hungrier?

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I feel like
I'm guilty of something.

00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Well, that's good.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.058 align:middle line:84%
That's your body's
wisdom talking to you.

00:04:41.058 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you notice that
you eat more food,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:84%
or you want to eat more
food, or you're hungrier--

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: --the less
supplements you take?

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not with me.

00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:90%
I've got incredible discipline.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: OK.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you call
yourself the pharmacist looking

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:90%
for good health--

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
good health to you?

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's a
great question, George,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.807 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind
of a vague term.

00:04:58.807 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But from a biochemical
perspective

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:84%
or a bioelectrical perspective,
it really is not vague at all.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Health comes from
the word whole.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:84%
When we're healthy,
our body is integrated.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:84%
All the parts of it are
integrated into a whole.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And that means that the
energy can flow from point A

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:90%
to point B effectively.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: From a biochemical or
a bioelectrical perspective,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
poor health, poor wholeness
if you will, is fragmentation.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And that fragmentation, instead
of allowing the electricity

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to flow evenly, it
creates short circuits.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.042 align:middle line:84%
And so when we are diseased,
we are short circuiting.

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:84%
We're short circuiting
at the level

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.640 align:middle line:90%
of the tissues and the organs.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're short circuiting,
most fundamentally,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:90%
at the level of the cell.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.057 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
it's all about, George.

00:05:42.057 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:90%
It's about the cell.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't ever hear about
the cell in medicine.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:90%
We always hear about the organ.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: People always
talk about breast cancer,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.017 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as
breast cancer, George.

00:05:52.017 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing as--

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean there's

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:90%
no such thing as breast cancer?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Let me elaborate here.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no such
thing as bone cancer.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as prostate cancer.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Sounds crazy, right?

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
There's breast cell cancer.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:90%
There's prostate cell cancer.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.238 align:middle line:90%
There's bone cell cancer.

00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is much more than
a semantic distinction

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:90%
that I'm making.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:84%
You see, cancer,
like all diseases,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
is not an organ phenomena,
it's a cell phenomenon.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's
important, George.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:90%
See--

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they replicate.

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, the
cells replicate as--

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, cancer is
very fascinating.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:90%
They replicate as cancer cells.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But here's the point, you see,
a cell doesn't need medicine.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is no medicine
that can help us out.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
This is why we
never hear about it.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:90%
The only thing that's in--

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
The only tool that's in the
medical person's magical bag

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of tricks are
tools that can drug

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
the cell, that can
radiate the cell, that

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
can electrocute the cell,
or that can starve the cell.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
We cannot do anything good
for the cell from a medical

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:90%
So we never hear about it.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:84%
We always hear, oh, we've
got to take that organ out,

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%
or we got to shut
down that chemistry,

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:84%
or we got to radiate it, or
we got to electrocute it.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:90%
See, here's the good news.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
The good news is we don't
need medical intervention

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:90%
to do what the cell needs.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
The cell only
needs three things.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be fed.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be oxygenated.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And it needs a clean
place to do its work.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And while there's no magical
tools in the doctor's bag

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.515 align:middle line:84%
of tricks that can feed
a cell, or oxygenated

00:07:24.515 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:90%
a cell, or detoxify a cell.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't need it because
it's a whole lifestyle.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beautiful
thing about recognizing

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:90%
the cellular nature of disease.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
When we understand
that when we're sick,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
we're sick at the
level of the cell,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
we'll understand why not only
can the medical practitioners'

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
tools not help the
cell, but even worse,

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:84%
we'll understand why the medical
practitioners' tools hurt

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
the cell, radiate the cell, kill
the cell, excelize the cell.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And we'll understand,
because a cell doesn't

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
need a lot of stuff, that it's
a question of what we eat,

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:84%
it's a question of how we
breathe and how we oxygenate,

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's a question of
keeping the environment clean.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's all you have
to do to stay healthy.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And we talked
about fragmentation

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:90%
being a sign of disease.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:84%
When all of the
cells of the body--

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And keep this in mind, George,
there's 100 trillion of them.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:84%
How is that even possible that
you have 100 trillion entities

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that are microscopic that
are somehow integrated enough

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:84%
to form George, or to form
Ben, or to form a heart,

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:90%
or to form a liver?

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.657 align:middle line:84%
The amount of coordination
and integration

00:08:27.657 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:84%
that it takes in order for
us to even just blink an eye,

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:84%
or move a finger,
or wiggle a toe

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:84%
is so miraculous that we are
literally walking miracles just

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
by virtue of our ability
to sit, and breathe,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and do the most fundamental
and basic things that we

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:90%
do in our lives.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's been a doctor,
Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Love him.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He has
been blacklisted.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yep.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He has
been put on trial

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.870 align:middle line:84%
for his work and discoveries
trying to heal cancer.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Isn't that terrible?

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:10%
- I first heard of Dr.
Burzynski back in the late 1980s

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:10%
when he was in a battle
with the Texas Medical Board

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:10%
and the FDA regarding his
innovative approach to cancer.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski had
MRIs, brain tumors

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:10%
known to be almost
universally fatal

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:10%
and it simply disappeared.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:10%
It was obvious to me
that Dr. Burzynski

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:10%
had made the most important
discovery in cancer treatment

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:10%
ever.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:84%
- While undergoing his
research to acquire his PhD,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Burzynski made a
profound discovery.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:10%
He found a strain of peptides
in human blood and urine

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:10%
that had never
before been recorded

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:10%
in biomedical research.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:10%
As his curiosity in
these peptides evolved,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:10%
he made another
profound observation.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:10%
People who were
inflicted with cancer

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:10%
seem to lack these newly
discovered peptides

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:10%
in both their blood
and urine, while those

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:10%
who were healthy
and free of cancer

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:10%
appeared to have an abundance.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.540 align:middle line:84%
- The worst type of cancer
can be cured for good.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
The people who are surviving,
they live normal life.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.770 align:middle line:84%
No side effects from treatment,
no symptoms, no sign of tumors,

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.850 align:middle line:90%
back to life.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:10%
- Since Dr. Burzynski began
treating cancer patients

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:10%
with antineoplastons,
he has successfully

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:10%
treated virtually
every type of cancer,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:10%
relieving thousands of
families from across the world

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:10%
of this dreaded disease.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:10%
Yet, unlike other
clinical trials,

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:10%
which are supported by billion
dollar pharmaceutical companies

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:10%
and are often assisted by
large tax funded research

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:10%
grants from the National
Cancer Institute,

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:10%
the United States
government currently

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:10%
prohibits any taxpayer money to
be granted to Dr. Burzynski's

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:10%
FDA approved clinical trials.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.780 align:middle line:84%
- The problem that
we face, however,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
is that a huge
financial house has

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.600 align:middle line:84%
been built on the
paradigm of purging

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:90%
the body of cancer cells.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski's discovery means
that the foundation, the walls,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and the roof of that
house need to be replaced.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why go after Burzynski?

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:90%
What are they after?

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, this is--
like Dr. Whitaker was saying,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
this is a big
financial boondoggle.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily
want to cure cancer,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:90%
we want to keep it going.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the thing,
George, cancer--

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.335 align:middle line:84%
a cancer cell is not a bad
guy, it's just a rouge--

00:11:19.335 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A cell
that's gone wild.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's gone wild.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It's under duress,
like a criminal.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Criminals aren't bad
people necessarily,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:90%
they've been abused.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So when a cell is starved, when
it's suffocated, especially

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
suffocated, and when
it's toxic, what

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:84%
will happen is if all things
are working correctly,

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:90%
the cell will commit suicide.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
This is really cool.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a suicide program built
into the cell called apoptosis.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And this cell suicide prevents
this dysfunctional, or sick,

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
or broken down, starving,
suffocated, toxic cell

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
from reproducing, and
that's a good thing.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:84%
However, every once in a
while that apoptosis self

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
killing or suicidal
program won't work.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.227 align:middle line:84%
And then that cell,
it starts to divide.

00:11:57.227 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Replicate more,
and more, and more.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: But here's the thing.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.630 align:middle line:84%
You see, George, there's
two kinds of cells.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:84%
There's old cells from an
evolutionary perspective,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
we call them pro
cells or prokaryotes.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there's advanced cells
like animal cells and plant

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.472 align:middle line:84%
Animal cells and
plant cells are said

00:12:12.472 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:84%
to be eukaryotes, good
cells or advanced cells.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: When a cell
is under duress,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.980 align:middle line:90%
it will not expend the energy.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have an ability
to expend the energy

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
to make all the substructures,
to make the nucleus where

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:84%
the genetic material
is, to be functional

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:84%
enough so that it can
become a liver, or a bone,

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:90%
or a prostate.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Instead--

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a kidney.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.832 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Or kidney or anything.

00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:37.845 align:middle line:84%
See, a cancer cell
is a cell almost

00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:84%
as if it's saying
to you, George,

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:84%
or to say to the owner
of the cancer cell,

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
you have been suffocating me
and starving me for so long

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:90%
and accumulating--

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
subjecting me to toxicity
for so long, you know what?

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to
be a liver anymore.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:90%
I am going to be my own thing.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to become a
hepatocyte, a liver cell.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
become my own thing.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
divide on my own.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to give up
of my independent will

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:84%
to become an organ, to become a
liver, or a kidney, or a bone.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:84%
You have been abusing
me for so long,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I am now going to just divide,
and divide, and divide,

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:90%
and divide.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's why cancer
cells are so problematic.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.787 align:middle line:84%
They don't give themselves
up for the team.

00:13:15.787 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't give themselves
up for the organ.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:90%
They become sociopathic.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.683 align:middle line:84%
They become just
living for themselves.

00:13:21.683 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a big metaphor
here, by the way,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:84%
because human beings function
the same way when they've

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:90%
been abused for long enough.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.837 align:middle line:84%
They say, forget
it, I'm not going

00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
to be a contributing
member of society.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.030 align:middle line:84%
A cell is-- a cancer cell is
a cell that no longer wants

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to become a contributing
member of the society,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and it divides on its
own like a bacteria cell,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
which is what a prokaryotes is.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, a
cancer cell is a cell

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:90%
that goes backwards in time.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
It reverses evolution from
being an advanced cell

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:84%
into being a primitive cell,
a cell that no longer cares

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:90%
about anybody but itself.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And instead of forming
organs, it forms films.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And these films are made up of
independent and discrete cells

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
in a way that advanced cells are
not when they become an organ.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that they're
dividing so rapidly

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.740 align:middle line:84%
means they're using
nutrition rapidly.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
people die of cancer.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Cancer doesn't really
kill on its own,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:84%
it kills by robbing
the body of nutrition

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.868 align:middle line:90%
because it's dividing--

00:14:16.868 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it chokes the body.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It chokes the body.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:84%
It chokes the body in
itself, in these films

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.072 align:middle line:84%
and it robs the
body of nutrition.

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And that really is
the issue with cancer.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is why, George, there
will never be a cure for cancer

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
because, you see, cancer
is an adaptive response.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what's
Burzynski doing?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Burzynski is
curing the-- he's not really

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
curing the cancer,
he's eliminated--

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.517 align:middle line:84%
he's changing the environment
that the cancer lives in.

00:14:42.517 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:84%
See, when a cancer--
cancer is so brilliant.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.557 align:middle line:90%
A cancer cell is brilliant.

00:14:45.557 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cancer loves sugar too.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.432 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, it
loves sugar, but it

00:14:48.432 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
wants to manipulate
the environment so

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:90%
that it can proliferate.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So it will produce
chemicals that

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
will break down the
environment and protect itself

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:84%
against the defense response,
against the immune system.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So Burzynski's doing
is he's removing

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:84%
some of those chemicals that
the cancer needs in order

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:90%
to proliferate and survive.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.235 align:middle line:84%
But as long as you keep
abusing the body by robbing it

00:15:11.235 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:84%
of oxygen, most importantly--
this is something Dr.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.068 align:middle line:84%
Otto Warburg talked
about many years ago,

00:15:15.068 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and we're now starting
to really appreciate--

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:84%
depriving it of
nutrition, and drowning it

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:84%
in sugar and acids and chemicals
and all the other things that

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:84%
are part and parcel of our 21st
century American lifestyle,

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:90%
cancer is going to come back.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do is you
want to change the environment

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that the cancer cell is sitting
in, and this is so important.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the environment
that needs to change.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
We're obsessed with what we
see, and that is the cell.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's the environment
that the cell is sitting in,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
the soup if you will, and
that is so cool because what

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:84%
it tells you is the cell is
responsive to the environment.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Change the environment,
you will change the cell.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a pharmacist,
but you're opposed

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:90%
to most prescription drugs.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, it's
not that cut and dry,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
because there are times when you
need prescription drugs, right?

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I had knee
surgery a few years ago,

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
them rolling me out

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.610 align:middle line:84%
of the operating
room on the gurney.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was laying there,
and I heard this voice.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded like my
voice, but it didn't seem

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.295 align:middle line:90%
to be coming from my mouth.

00:16:18.295 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was going, morphine.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Give me morphine.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't saying
vitamin C, and I

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:84%
wasn't saying whey protein,
I was saying morphine.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And praise god that
we have morphine,

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.260 align:middle line:90%
because you know what, George?

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Before morphine, when they
needed to take your leg off,

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.082 align:middle line:84%
they gave you
something to bite on.

00:16:37.082 --> 00:16:37.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or whiskey.

00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Or a little
bit of whiskey, right?

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:90%
And they got to sawing.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what
this must have been like?

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ugh!

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:84%
When they did surgery
in the Middle Ages,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:84%
they would have to
hold you down before--

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: While you
withered in pain.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Can you imagine what
this must have been like?

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I'm not
pollyannish about prescription

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:90%
drugs.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.668 align:middle line:84%
But here's the problem
with prescription drugs.

00:16:55.668 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
We use them to
disguise the signs

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:90%
of our ineffective lifestyle.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.059 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We mask things
and abuse things.

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.758 align:middle line:84%
For example, diabetes
drugs, right?

00:17:06.758 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
To this day, among
the best selling drugs

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.340 align:middle line:84%
every year is diabetes drugs,
metformin specifically.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Every year.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.027 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that diabetes, which
is the leading cause of death

00:17:18.027 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:84%
in this country-- when
you factor its involvement

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:84%
with cancer, and you factor its
involvement with autoimmunity

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.802 align:middle line:84%
and dementia-- blood sugar, I
don't like calling it diabetes.

00:17:24.802 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Dysglycemia, messed
up blood sugar,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is the leading cause
of death, George,

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and it is a purely, purely
100% lifestyle issue.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:90%
It is not genetic.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:84%
It is not the
atmosphere, the air.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
It is what you're
putting in your body.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the body's
response to sugar.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:90%
But yet, we think it's OK.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.683 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Whitaker talked
about the paradigm.

00:17:48.683 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:90%
It's really a paradigm here.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
individuals, and it's not

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:90%
about individual doctors.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.442 align:middle line:84%
I've got to be very
clear about this.

00:17:53.442 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Doctors are good people.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Their problem is the
model, the paradigm.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The paradigm says, eat
what you want to eat,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and we have a little
metformin for you

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:90%
to adjust your blood sugar.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Live your life the way
you want to live it,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.140 align:middle line:90%
and we'll give you a drug.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I was just reading the other
day how antibiotics are now

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:84%
known to be stored in the
microbiome, the bacteria that

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:90%
live in the gut.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And the bacteria
that live in the gut

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.805 align:middle line:84%
are now known to change
the effect of antibiotics.

00:18:19.805 --> 00:18:20.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:18:20.805 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Isn't it amazing?

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So even good drugs
that have obviously

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
saved a lot of people,
like antibiotics,

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.908 align:middle line:90%
have a dark side to them.

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:90%
And so that's number one.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.708 align:middle line:84%
Problem number one
is the fact that we

00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
can continue about
our lifestyle that

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:84%
caused the problem
in the first place

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and just take a drug in
order to hide the symptoms.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.048 align:middle line:84%
Not to change the problem,
because you're still

00:18:38.048 --> 00:18:39.210 align:middle line:90%
shortening your lifespan.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Your body is still breaking
down, you just don't see it.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.437 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it really
gets to be a problematic,

00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and nobody ever
talks about this.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
When you take a
prescription drug,

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:84%
the body looks at that from
a cellular perspective.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the cell.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: The cell
looks at that drug.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:90%
You know it says?

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:84%
It says, get thee
Satan behind me.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It says, get out of here.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.380 align:middle line:90%
It does not want that drug.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you eat food, when you
eat an amino acid or a vitamin

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
or mineral or
essential fatty acid,

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that gets incorporated
into the cell.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
The cell can now work
with that material.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:84%
But when you take a drug,
that's regarded as a poison.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And it mobilizes and marshals
the entire poison control

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:90%
All drugs do this.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, the body has

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to use vitamin C to
detoxify the drug.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.315 align:middle line:84%
It has to use vitamin E. It
has to use the B complex.

00:19:28.315 --> 00:19:29.190 align:middle line:90%
It has to use copper.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:90%
It has to use magnesium.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So not only is the
drug not helping,

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's costing you
the precious nutrients

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:84%
that your body has
that would help you

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
with the problem
in the first place.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, as if
that's not bad enough,

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
drugs don't just work
on one part of the body.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:90%
They work on the entire body.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
If you take a calcium channel
blocker for your heart,

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.618 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
affect your kidneys.

00:19:51.618 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
affect your prostate.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
That's going to affect
your digestive system.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.047 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
affect your brain.

00:19:56.047 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:90%
It can't help but do it.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But know
what they call it?

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:90%
They call it side effects.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not a side effect.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:90%
It's an effect.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.975 align:middle line:84%
They make it seem
like oh, it's an oops.

00:20:05.975 --> 00:20:07.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's a big effect.

00:20:07.413 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's a huge effect.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Gaia News" reported
on the importance of the gut

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.040 align:middle line:90%
microbiome.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In an interview
with Dr. John Douillard.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.295 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch.

00:20:17.295 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN DOUILLARD: The best way
to boost microbial diversity,

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.945 align:middle line:90%
the first step is with fiber.

00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And what fiber does
is not only does it

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:84%
feed the bugs in
your gut, but it also

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
attaches to the bile, which is
like a Pac-Man in your liver

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:84%
gobbling up toxins, a Pac-Man
in your intestinal tract,

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
cleaning out all the villi
in your intestinal tract.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat that fiber,
it takes all the toxins

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:90%
to the toilet.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't eat
enough fiber, up to 94%

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:84%
of the bile with toxins
in tow get reabsorbed back

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:90%
to your liver.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And they dump their trash
back into your liver,

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.570 align:middle line:84%
making it more difficult for
your body to properly detox.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And in an environment of
toxicity-- environmental

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
pollutants, endocrine
disruptors--

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.550 align:middle line:84%
it's so critically important
we have a detox system that

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:90%
is really optimal.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:10%
>> For Dr. Douillard, eating
seasonally also plays a vital

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:10%
role in promoting diversity.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: But the studies
show that the bugs in the soil

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:84%
change dramatically
from season to season.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have bugs
that are actually

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:84%
really good at delivering
fat and fiber as fuel

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:84%
in the spring, and carbohydrates
and starches in the fall.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So how do we get
microbial diversity back

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.020 align:middle line:84%
is by starting to eat
more diverse foods.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:84%
In season, get the right
bugs with the right season

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
so you have the ability to
burn fat as fuel in the spring,

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.955 align:middle line:84%
and carbohydrates as
fuel in the summer.

00:21:35.955 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He is right.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You are what you eat.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I've got to love Dr. Douillard.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.220 align:middle line:90%
I've known him for many years.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.230 align:middle line:90%
He's a really good guy.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.283 align:middle line:90%
He's 100% correct.

00:21:43.283 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I would add on the fiber,
people don't realize

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:90%
the detoxifying power of fiber.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
We talk about it
for bowel movements

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and for digestive health,
but it's extremely

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.528 align:middle line:90%
important for detoxification.

00:21:52.528 --> 00:21:53.987 align:middle line:84%
Here's something
else that's really

00:21:53.987 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:90%
cool about fiber, George.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria eat fiber,
and they release

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
some of the most powerful
mood stabilizing,

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:84%
happy chemicals you could
ever imagine-- something

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:84%
called butyrate acid, which is
a fatty acid, that not only is

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:84%
important for your
mood, but it's also

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
important for your
immune system.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.447 align:middle line:84%
It's also a tremendous
body builder.

00:22:13.447 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a body building supplement.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And it helps
you sleep on top of that.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.812 align:middle line:84%
And these are all the benefits
that you get from fiber.

00:22:19.812 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to people
who are carnivore people.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever talked
to the carnivore people

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.380 align:middle line:90%
who only eat meat?

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And for the life of
me, I can't figure out

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:84%
how anybody could think
from a health perspective

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that you could somehow be better
off by not ingesting fiber

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:90%
containing foods.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:90%
It's that important.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every day, what
I do in the morning,

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time to
eat a big breakfast,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:90%
but I want to be full.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.248 align:middle line:84%
I want to have
stuff in my stomach.

00:22:40.248 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I grind up flaxseeds
in a coffee grinder,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.247 align:middle line:84%
and I put them in water with
a little bit of cinnamon

00:22:46.247 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit of clove.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I make the most
delicious fiber drink.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And flaxseeds are particularly
a good source of nutrition,

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
not just for fiber, but for
protein and for vitamins

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.305 align:middle line:90%
and for omega fatty acids.

00:22:57.305 --> 00:22:58.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:58.105 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And the fiber
fills up your belly,

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.182 align:middle line:90%
so you're satisfied.

00:23:02.182 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And as it drops down
into your intestine,

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.057 align:middle line:84%
it feeds your bacteria, as
Dr. Douillard was saying.

00:23:06.057 --> 00:23:06.932 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:23:06.932 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:90%
What do you call good health?

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.943 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Good health is when you
want to get up in the morning

00:23:10.943 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and do your life.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.692 align:middle line:84%
And that's such a great
question because we

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
have allowed the medical
model to move the goalposts.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
They tell us good health is
a good cholesterol score.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It's good blood pressure, a
good blood pressure score.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.468 align:middle line:84%
It's a good basal
metabolic rate.

00:23:25.468 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take this statin drug.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.890 align:middle line:84%
They've allowed us to think
that health is about metrics.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
But health is not about
metrics because you

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:84%
can be making a lot
of thyroid hormone

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:90%
and feel lousy, or vice versa.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
You could have low cholesterol
and get a heart attack.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Or you can have high cholesterol
and live a good long life.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:84%
The markers of health
are not health.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Low cholesterol is
worse than high cholesterol,

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:51.665 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:23:51.665 --> 00:23:53.873 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Cholesterol is one
of the most misunderstood

00:23:53.873 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:84%
molecules that, to a biochemist
which I consider myself to be,

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:84%
cholesterol is the most
important and miraculous

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:90%
molecule in the body.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
The more stress you're under,
the more you need cholesterol.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:84%
The more bodybuilding
you're doing,

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle line:90%
the more you need cholesterol.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:84%
The more your immune
system is suppressed

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:84%
or you're under immune attack,
the more you need cholesterol.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The more your brain function
is starting to decrease,

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:90%
the more you need cholesterol.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Cholesterol is the
body's adapting molecule.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you want it to
suppress a culture's ability

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.580 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to their environment,
to thrive in their environment,

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.060 align:middle line:84%
you would give them a drug that
suppressed their cholesterol.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the height of
the biochemical lunacy

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmacological
models that we

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.915 align:middle line:84%
use to protect
against heart disease.

00:24:41.915 --> 00:24:44.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't most people
take care of themselves?

00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:46.913 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You know, that's
a loaded question, George.

00:24:46.913 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that that's
necessarily a health issue.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I think number one,
there's ignorance.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.010 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I don't mean
that in an insulting way,

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.440 align:middle line:84%
but we just are
ignorant of the facts.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're not
aware of things

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.368 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yeah. we're
not aware of things.

00:24:58.368 --> 00:25:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think also,
George, there's

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.860 align:middle line:84%
an element of we don't
know how good we can feel.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.340 align:middle line:84%
We set the bar so low
on health that we're

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:84%
just happy if we get
up in the morning.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:12.013 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that it's
possible to jump out

00:25:12.013 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:90%
of bed in the morning.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.638 align:middle line:84%
What do you do every
morning, first thing

00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:90%
in the morning, George?

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I do my Royal Canadian
Air Force exercise course.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly, exactly.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:25.350 align:middle line:84%
We are capable of not just
getting up in the morning,

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:84%
bleary eyed, walking
to the coffeemaker

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.440 align:middle line:90%
and making a cup of coffee.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:84%
We're capable of every
morning, bounding out of bed

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.717 align:middle line:84%
and doing exercises and
having the blood circulate.

00:25:33.717 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not judging anybody,
or saying anybody's

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:90%
bad for not doing it.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
we're capable of.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know that because
we've allowed other people

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:90%
to tell us what health means.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.742 align:middle line:84%
I get calls from people
who have cancer, right?

00:25:46.742 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And they've been diagnosed
with certain things.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:90%
It's really tragic, right?

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's sad.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.655 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So what I say is,
don't worry about your cancer.

00:25:52.655 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Worry about how good you feel.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Worry about the energy
levels you have.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.483 align:middle line:84%
Take advantage of the metrics
that are experiential,

00:26:00.483 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:84%
not the metrics that are
on the piece of paper

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.658 align:middle line:84%
that you got, the email or
that the doctor gave you

00:26:04.658 --> 00:26:05.700 align:middle line:90%
when you left the office.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.150 align:middle line:84%
The metrics that you can
really sense and perceive--

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
how clear you're thinking,
how much energy you have,

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.460 align:middle line:84%
the kind of sleep you're
getting-- all of these metrics

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.590 align:middle line:84%
are metrics that are
within our control.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:84%
They're experiential metrics
that we can perceive really,

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:84%
in real time, and they
are metrics that we can

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:90%
change really, in real time.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Joe Dispenza
on Gaia's "Rewired" program

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.920 align:middle line:84%
talked about how the mind can
change your body chemistry.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Love that.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:10%
>>JOE DISPENZA: If you think
the same thoughts every single

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:36.970 align:middle line:10%
day--

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:41.190 align:middle line:10%
and for the most part,
most people, 80% to 90%

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:10%
of their thoughts are the same
thoughts as the day before.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:10%
And your biology, your neural
circuitry, your neurochemistry,

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:10%
your hormones, and even
your gene expression

00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:10%
is equal to how you think,
how you act, and how you feel.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:10%
In other words, everything
stays the same in the body

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:10%
if you stay the same.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:10%
Well, it begs the question
then, is it possible

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:10%
that new thoughts--

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:10%
that lead to new choices, that
lead to new behaviors, that

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.190 align:middle line:10%
create new
experiences, that lead

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:10%
to new emotions and
new feelings that

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.690 align:middle line:10%
could inspire new thoughts--

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:10%
begin to change your biology?

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:10%
Would you begin to see
significant changes

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:10%
in the brain, as
well as the body?

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:10%
And our research proves
that when you change,

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.195 align:middle line:10%
everything changes around you.

00:27:38.195 --> 00:27:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: 100%, 100%.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Information is not just a word.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:90%
It has meaning, information.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.580 align:middle line:84%
How we think is a function
of how the neurons, the nerve

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:90%
cells, take form in the brain.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous neurologist
named Hebb who said,

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.245 align:middle line:84%
nerves that fire
together wire together.

00:27:58.245 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And what ends up happening when
nerve cells fire a certain way,

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:90%
they form patterns in the brain.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.012 align:middle line:84%
And then, energy is conducted
through those patterns that

00:28:05.012 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:84%
creates thoughts, then
ultimately creates

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.970 align:middle line:84%
hormones and chemistry
and creates our lives.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Information, new
information that comes in,

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:90%
creates new forms.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Information, it creates
new forms inside the brain,

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and the neurons start to
take on different shapes.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So instead of a pattern
or a web of neurons

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that creates a final shape
that will lead you to smoke

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.700 align:middle line:84%
cigarettes, you can create
a pattern or a shape

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:84%
or a web of neurology
that makes you want

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:90%
to quit smoking cigarettes.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But it requires information,
new information.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So Dr. Joe's right.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Dr. Joe
is always right.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Joe's amazing.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
this thing in pharmacy

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.605 align:middle line:90%
they call the placebo effect.

00:28:45.605 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Have you ever
heard of the placebo effect?

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So they have to take
it out because if they

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.560 align:middle line:84%
don't take it out of the
experiment, they won't know.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.768 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They won't know
what works and what doesn't.

00:28:54.768 --> 00:28:56.935 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So I say, how about
if we take out the drug

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:90%
and use the placebo effect?

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:84%
How about if we
started teaching people

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:84%
how to control their
biochemistries?

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, people talk
about mind over matter.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It sounds woo woo, right?

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.432 align:middle line:84%
Oh, mind over matter, you
really believe in that?

00:29:09.432 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Look, mind over matter.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:84%
You lift your hand,
that's mind over matter.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
You perform any biological
function, any motor function,

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:90%
you're doing mind over matter.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
We experience the
power of the mind

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:90%
with every movement we make.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:84%
We just don't attribute it
to the mind, unfortunately,

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:31.675 align:middle line:84%
and that ultimately is
to our ultimate loss.

00:29:31.675 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
eating right, supplements,

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.075 align:middle line:84%
minimal prescription drugs,
what kind of road are we on?

00:29:39.075 --> 00:29:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Are we going down
the right path?

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Heck yes.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.153 align:middle line:84%
You've got to throw in
a couple more things.

00:29:43.153 --> 00:29:44.307 align:middle line:90%
Breathing, don't forget.

00:29:44.307 --> 00:29:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're into that?

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Heck yes,
I'm into that.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to ever
stop breathing, George.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But I'm kind of
kidding because we

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.670 align:middle line:84%
do learn to hold our breath as
part of the stress response.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:84%
If you think of something
right now that's unpleasant,

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll find yourself doing
a little micro contraction.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:01.837 align:middle line:90%
Think of it.

00:30:01.837 --> 00:30:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Kind of perceive it.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Just think of something
that you don't like,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:84%
something going on in
your life you don't like.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.355 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel a little
micro contraction.

00:30:06.355 --> 00:30:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You get a little tense.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.668 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: A little
bit tense, right?

00:30:08.668 --> 00:30:12.550 align:middle line:84%
We learn to do this as babies,
and these micro contractions

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.600 align:middle line:90%
continue the rest of our lives.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And they create a sort
of armor on the body.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Dr. Wilhelm Reich
called it body armoring.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And these armored pockets that
we have throughout our body

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:84%
represent places where
we're not getting oxygen.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And these places where we're
not getting oxygen ultimately

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:84%
become little pockets
of death, and that's

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.000 align:middle line:84%
what causes ultimately
someone to say

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.960 align:middle line:84%
at the end of 40 years of life,
oh, my god, my knee hurts.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, my god, I've
got fibromyalgia.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, my god, god
forbid you get cancer.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:84%
What you're experiencing is the
end result of decades of these

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:84%
micro contractions which
represent losses of oxygen

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:84%
to the body, which is why one
of the most relaxing, peaceful,

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.800 align:middle line:84%
health inducing things
you can ever do, George,

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.600 align:middle line:84%
is practicing what I call
SDR breathing-- slow,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.210 align:middle line:84%
very important, deep, very
important to activate the lower

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:06.010 align:middle line:90%
part of the heart--

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through your
mouth or through your nose?

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Always
through the nose.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Nose is for breathing,
mouth is for eating.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.652 align:middle line:84%
Unless you really need to
get a lot of breath in,

00:31:11.652 --> 00:31:12.610 align:middle line:90%
then you use the mouth.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:84%
But for these exercises,
always through the nose.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:21.420 align:middle line:84%
You activate nitric
oxide opening cells

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
right in the top of your nose
that lower your blood pressure

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.023 align:middle line:84%
and improve your mood,
improve your immune system.

00:31:26.023 --> 00:31:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And you only get those
in the top of the nose.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom
of the diaphragm,

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:84%
where you expand
your diaphragm, you

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:35.770 align:middle line:84%
activate your parasympathetic
relaxation nervous system.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:90%
And the brain loves rhythm.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.498 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't nitric
oxide good for you?

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Heck yes,
it's good for you.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It dilates your
arteries, doesn't it?

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.372 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's so amazing.

00:31:44.372 --> 00:31:46.000 align:middle line:84%
It was Molecule of
the Year in 1999.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And arginine, the
amino acid arginine,

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.580 align:middle line:84%
is one of the best
nutritional supplements

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.860 align:middle line:90%
for getting your nitric oxide.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've heard of
nitrate's the problem, nitrates

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:53.820 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Nitrates are good for you.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.725 align:middle line:84%
They're just not good
for you when they

00:31:56.725 --> 00:31:58.888 align:middle line:90%
come in concentrated forms.

00:31:58.888 --> 00:32:00.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you get it
from l-arginine, right?

00:32:00.805 --> 00:32:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You make nitric
oxide from l-arginine.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Amino acids are amino
acids because they

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.820 align:middle line:84%
contain nitrogen.
An amino acid is

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:13.780 align:middle line:84%
a sugar or a fat with nitrogen,
a carbohydrate with nitrogen.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.978 align:middle line:84%
Nitrogen turns ordinary
glycerin-- you've

00:32:15.978 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:90%
heard of glycerin, right?

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.853 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:32:17.853 --> 00:32:20.735 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It turns ordinary
glycerin into dynamite.

00:32:20.735 --> 00:32:21.535 align:middle line:90%
What's dynamite?

00:32:21.535 --> 00:32:22.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Boom.

00:32:22.335 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Exactly,
boom, nitroglycerin.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Nitroglycerin is glycerin,
ordinary glycerin.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.840 align:middle line:90%
You could drink it.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You can put in your
skincare products.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.258 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Turns it into
something that's so explosive,

00:32:34.258 --> 00:32:35.800 align:middle line:84%
you can blow a
mountain open with it.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: If you take
dynamite, TNT, right?

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.570 align:middle line:90%
TNT is trinitrotoluene.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:47.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a nail polish remover
with nitrogen. Nitrogen

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:90%
is explosive.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.978 align:middle line:84%
The farmers all know about the
explosive power of nitrogen.

00:32:50.978 --> 00:32:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Remember the Oklahoma
City bombing?

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:55.540 align:middle line:90%
What did they use?

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.373 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fertilizer.

00:32:56.373 --> 00:32:57.895 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: What does
fertilizer have?

00:32:57.895 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nitrogen.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Nitrogen gives us the
power to be human.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It gives plants
the power to grow.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:90%
It's an explosive element.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.730 align:middle line:84%
But that's why it's so
problematic when you use it

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.800 align:middle line:84%
as a preservative,
because you're

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.362 align:middle line:84%
getting concentrated
nitrogen, nitrogen

00:33:14.362 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
in a way that nature
never intended

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.490 align:middle line:84%
us to have nitrogen. One of
the best ways to get nitrogen

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:20.200 align:middle line:84%
is from green leafy
vegetables that

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.410 align:middle line:84%
have been grown in good soil,
which is why when Popeye wanted

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.120 align:middle line:90%
to get strong to fight off--

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spinach.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Exactly, because
spinach is one of nature's best

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.745 align:middle line:90%
sources of explosive nitrogen.

00:33:30.745 --> 00:33:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it that
some people look their age,

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.400 align:middle line:90%
and some people don't?

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, we talk about
these micro contractions,

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
them through the body.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:84%
The face holds lots
of micro contractions.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.950 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
muscles in our face.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
biggest muscles,

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the biggest muscle in
the body, is right in the jaw.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the jaw, yeah.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: If you want to have
your face look really beautiful

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.197 align:middle line:84%
for a really long
period of time--

00:33:54.197 --> 00:33:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time
get better sleep,

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:84%
improve your immune system,
and feel more relaxed--

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.793 align:middle line:90%
learn to relax the face.

00:34:00.793 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you do that?

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: By just focusing on
the muscle groups and relaxing.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.385 align:middle line:90%
You can do it right now.

00:34:05.385 --> 00:34:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You mean mentally?

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.976 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: What's that?

00:34:08.976 --> 00:34:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Slack jawed.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't want
to do it in public,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:90%
maybe not on television.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.694 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's that affliction
where your muscles in your face

00:34:16.694 --> 00:34:17.494 align:middle line:90%
go--

00:34:17.494 --> 00:34:18.179 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Bell's palsy?

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yeah, that's
horrible, right?

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.534 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it?

00:34:20.534 --> 00:34:22.346 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's a
terrible nerve condition

00:34:22.346 --> 00:34:24.179 align:middle line:84%
where you lose control
of half of your face,

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.110 align:middle line:90%
and it just droops.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.085 align:middle line:90%
And it's an awful thing.

00:34:28.085 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How
important is the skin?

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You know I
love the skin, George.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.235 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You love the skin.

00:34:32.235 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I love the skin.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the body's largest organ,
and it's my favorite organ.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.889 align:middle line:84%
I find the skin so
fascinating because we

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:84%
have this love hate relationship
with the skin, right?

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:42.939 align:middle line:90%
We love our skin.

00:34:42.939 --> 00:34:45.139 align:middle line:84%
We spend billions of
dollars, hundreds of billions

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:47.270 align:middle line:84%
of dollars on taking care of
it, on skin care products.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.145 align:middle line:84%
We spend way more on
taking care of our skin,

00:34:49.145 --> 00:34:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and way more time spent
taking care of our skin

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:90%
than our heart.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we took care
of our heart an hour

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:84%
a day, like a lot of
people do with their skin.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'd be in great shape.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.060 align:middle line:90%
But we do it with our skin.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.238 align:middle line:90%
Because people can see our skin.

00:35:01.238 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, the great irony

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.330 align:middle line:84%
is even though that's the
organ that we can see the most

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and everybody can see the
most, that's the organ we

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:90%
know the least about.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.470 align:middle line:84%
The skin is so complex,
and there is so much

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.880 align:middle line:90%
happening inside the skin.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been writing a
book about the skin now.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.147 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it rejuvenates
so darn fast, too.

00:35:17.147 --> 00:35:18.183 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: On its own!

00:35:18.183 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Cut yourself, you
don't even look at it.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't even think about it,
and two days later the cut's

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:22.570 align:middle line:90%
healed.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:23.690 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is going on?

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:25.712 align:middle line:90%
The skin is layered, right?

00:35:25.712 --> 00:35:28.170 align:middle line:84%
It's stratified, so you've got
a top layer, tippy top layer

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that's about as thick as
1/10 of a piece of notebook

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:90%
paper, George.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.188 align:middle line:90%
Can imagine how thin that is?

00:35:32.188 --> 00:35:34.612 align:middle line:84%
But that holds everything
in place, that tiny sliver.

00:35:34.612 --> 00:35:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Then underneath, you
have about one piece

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.730 align:middle line:84%
of notebook paper,
and then a third layer

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.772 align:middle line:84%
that's about nine pieces
of notebook paper thick.

00:35:39.772 --> 00:35:43.550 align:middle line:90%


00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I've been writing a book now
about the skin for about six,

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.720 align:middle line:90%
seven months.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm on page 50, and I'm just
talking about that top layer.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This right here.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.943 align:middle line:90%
It's called the stratum corneum.

00:35:53.943 --> 00:35:56.690 align:middle line:84%
When you have dry skin,
you have a problem

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:84%
making all the wonderful
moisture factors

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.820 align:middle line:84%
that you need to make to keep
that stratum corneum moist.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And guess what.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.870 align:middle line:84%
The worst thing you can put
on your dry skin, George--

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:05.720 align:middle line:90%
get ready for this--

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.600 align:middle line:90%
a moisturizer.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:36:07.295 --> 00:36:08.628 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Isn't that interesting?

00:36:08.628 --> 00:36:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever wonder why we spend
so much money on moisturizing

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:84%
creams in this country, but
at the same time everybody

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.952 align:middle line:90%
has dry skin?

00:36:15.952 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you what's
happening, George.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:84%
See, your skin makes its
own moisture factors.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.932 align:middle line:84%
It produces them, and
they rise to the top

00:36:21.932 --> 00:36:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and they get stored
in the surface.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.460 align:middle line:84%
This is how nature
intended us to be moist.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.830 align:middle line:84%
However, when you put a
moisturizing cream on,

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.350 align:middle line:90%
you suppress that chemistry.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:33.470 align:middle line:84%
You prevent the skin
from moisturizing itself.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And then when your moisturizer
wears off, now you're like, oh,

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:90%
my god, I'm really dry.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go get
some more moisturizer.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:84%
You put it on, you
suppress the chemistry.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:84%
You say, oh, my
god, I'm really dry.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.872 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get some
extra strength moisturizer.

00:36:44.872 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You should have
become a dermatologist.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Pharmacist Ben
Fuchs, his website is

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Radio.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:58.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People can call
that and ask questions.

00:36:58.565 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Or email,
they can also email

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:90%
health@criticalhealthnews.com.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:02.960 align:middle line:90%
We love emails.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've been doing
this, do you miss pharmacy?

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Well, I'm
opening up a pharmacy.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Funny you should ask.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you are?

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.827 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yes, I'm opening
up a compounding pharmacy.

00:37:10.827 --> 00:37:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I do miss the interaction.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:10%
There's a special
relationship, George,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:10%
that the pharmacist
has with the patient.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.700 align:middle line:10%
And the doctor patient
relationship is special,

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:10%
the nurse patient
relationship is special.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:10%
But there's
something very unique

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:23.690 align:middle line:10%
about the pharmacist
patient relationship,

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.390 align:middle line:10%
in the sense that we're the
ones that the patient comes

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.920 align:middle line:10%
to ask about their drugs, to
ask about their supplements.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: To ask about their
herbs or even their medication.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doctors should
be doing that to you, too.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Some of
them do, that's true.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But with the patient,
you form a bond

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.790 align:middle line:84%
with the patient that
is really familial.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.707 align:middle line:84%
It's like they become a
member of your family,

00:37:42.707 --> 00:37:43.957 align:middle line:90%
and I do miss that connection.

00:37:43.957 --> 00:37:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you,
as a pharmacist,

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.260 align:middle line:84%
ever prescribed a
drug or gotten a drug,

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.135 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't want to
give it to the person?

00:37:50.135 --> 00:37:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I actually got fired
from my first pharmacy job

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:54.470 align:middle line:90%
because I was doing that.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.785 align:middle line:84%
And what I was
doing, at first I was

00:37:56.785 --> 00:37:58.160 align:middle line:84%
suggesting people
use supplements

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.077 align:middle line:90%
with their medication.

00:37:59.077 --> 00:38:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
I was suggesting

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.070 align:middle line:84%
people use supplements
instead of their medication.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.062 align:middle line:84%
And that didn't
go over real well,

00:38:06.062 --> 00:38:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and that was actually
the last time

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I worked for a big, big
chain as a pharmacist.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
was when you decided

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.260 align:middle line:90%
to make a change for yourself.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: That's when
I decided to do things

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.870 align:middle line:90%
for myself, exactly right.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
this go from here, Ben?

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.052 align:middle line:84%
How do people take
care of themselves?

00:38:19.052 --> 00:38:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Most importantly,
what we just talked about.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Get information.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Start to understand the body.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.837 align:middle line:90%
To me, love is curiosity.

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:10%
There's a relationship between
love and curiosity in the sense

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.670 align:middle line:10%
that when you're curious about
something, you're showing love.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you love something,
you're curious about it.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:84%
You ever meet somebody,
and you're in love

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.720 align:middle line:84%
with them or you fall
in love with them,

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.720 align:middle line:84%
or even if you like them a lot,
you get curious about them.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.928 align:middle line:84%
You want to know how they
work, what makes them tick.

00:38:40.928 --> 00:38:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's fall in love
with our bodies.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's fall in love with our
heart, our spleen, our liver.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Simple
enough, isn't it?

00:38:45.795 --> 00:38:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: To me, your
body is your best friend

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:48.563 align:middle line:90%
going through life.

00:38:48.563 --> 00:38:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's give it a little love.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, thanks for

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:52.250 align:middle line:90%

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.020 align:middle line:10%
he says and better yourself.
