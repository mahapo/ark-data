We've got a fascinating

you came on "Coast to Coast,"

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:84%
so many people fascinated
with what you do.

How did you get
involved in this?

>>MIRZA: Oh, I think I am
one of those stories that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.100 align:middle line:10%
isn't that I came
from-- my grandmother

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:10%
was a psychic medium,
or my mom was psychic.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.080 align:middle line:84%
My background, I
was born in Harlem.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Raised in the Bronx

>>MIRZA: Yeah.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:10%
At least, I thought so.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:10%
And I was spending most
of my time feeling scared

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:10%
of being alone in
the dark, or feeling

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:10%
people's emotions around me.

I was just maybe a little bit

off.

And maybe I was.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But I was always tuned
into something else.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I always felt there
was something more.

your first psychic experience.

was going around

I blurted out,

an old man died on that couch.

know why I said it.

>>MIRZA: No.

>>NOORY: You just said it?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.133 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: I just said it,
because there was nothing else.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a reason,
because my mind was blank.

I teach them, do it
while you're driving.

Do it while you're
doing something else

And you're writing on

And it sucks, whatever,
as you're writing.

You crumple it and you throw it.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Like this.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:90%
You throw it this way.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:90%
And it lands in the wastebasket.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.617 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or somewhere close.

00:03:29.617 --> 00:03:30.417 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Right.

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But it has happened
where it landed.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Without you looking.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.230 align:middle line:90%
And then you try to do it again.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.583 align:middle line:90%
This time you're looking.

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:90%
And rarely do you get it in.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you can't hit it.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: And you can't hit it.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So it is that zen
state of mind where

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
you don't have too much
emotional investment in it.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:90%
You're open.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.618 align:middle line:84%
So that's what happened
when I was seven.

00:03:47.618 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So the woman comes over and
she kneels down to me and says,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:90%
what did you say?

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
My mom is shooting me a look,
like, what is wrong with you?

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Are you-- have you
lost your mind?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.285 align:middle line:84%
My kid, what's
happened to him, right?

00:03:58.285 --> 00:03:59.085 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Right.

00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And it embarrassed her.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:90%
But the woman said it's true.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Her father did pass
away on that couch.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And she said, is
there anything else?

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said he likes
drinking tea over there.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.652 align:middle line:84%
So she said that when
he had passed away,

00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:17.110 align:middle line:84%
he had come out of the bedroom,
sat in that exact same spot

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.742 align:middle line:84%
that I had said, and
was drinking tea.

00:04:18.742 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he had a
heart attack and passed away.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he just died.

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yeah.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you saw him
mentally, was he dead already?

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: So what I saw is
what I call an imprint.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
I can describe it.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see him the way some
mediums actually see a spirit

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:90%
in front of them, almost 3D.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Mine was more a complete
intuitive feeling

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:90%
that washed over me suddenly.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:10%
It was a voice that
said this to me.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know whose voice it was.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:90%
I was completely new to this.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
All I can tell you
was that I felt it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost
as if-- you know

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
if I were to get
up from this couch,

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
there might be an
impression of where I sat.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:90%
For a while.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.705 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: For a while.

00:05:00.705 --> 00:05:02.590 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of like that.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your wife,
Oriah, we met her back

00:05:04.385 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:90%
in the dressing room.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yeah.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But tell us.

00:05:06.345 --> 00:05:09.205 align:middle line:84%
There's a special thing
about that for you.

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Well, I always
feel that-- we talk

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:90%
about what twin flames are.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:10%
Soul mates and twin flames,
and these terminologies that

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:10%
are used.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:10%
But Oriah is also an empath--

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:10%
an intuitive empath.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:10%
So she feels the energy
and emotions of people.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of like a psychic
paranormal husband and wife

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.201 align:middle line:90%
team in L.A.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.001 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:28.450 align:middle line:90%
That makes it work, huh?

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: It does.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:90%
And it makes it work out there.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
But then when you're
spending time together,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:84%
you know what the other
person's going to do.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there a story
about a son in Japan?

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yeah.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Because when we met, we met at a
mutual friend's birthday party.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of didn't
want to be there.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:90%
And she was sitting next to me.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:90%
And so I just give a reading.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
If I'm bored, I'm just
going to give a reading

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:90%
to the person next to me.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MIRZA: And she said, well--

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:10%
she told me the number
of children she had.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.850 align:middle line:10%
She had five kids.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:10%
And I said, is there a boy?

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.032 align:middle line:10%
She said, yes.

00:05:55.032 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I have to
ask you a weird question.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.703 align:middle line:90%
Is he Japanese?

00:05:58.703 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Out of
the blue, you say?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Out of the blue.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And she's not East
Asian at all, my wife.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:90%
And she says, no.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
But that's very
strange you say that.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:90%
He is obsessed with Japan.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: He was, at the
time, I think 15 or 16,

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:90%
learning Japanese on his own.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Actually now is a
master origami artist.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:10%
And he's a regular white
kid, you might say.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So what I pick up
on is the past life.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:90%
When I met him, I knew.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah-ha.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yeah.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:90%
So there's-- it comes through.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Things that you're interested
in, countries or places you're

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
drawn to without having an
explanation for yourself

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:90%
as to why.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Not because you're looking to
see that particular tourist

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
site there, but you
know that your feet

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:90%
have to be on that land.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Mm-hmm.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you connect
with your own intuition?

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you do anything special?

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: You know, I've said
this, that I think a lot of--

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
you mean if I'm
reading for myself?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Oh, I can't do it.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't do yourself.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Because a
massage therapist

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:90%
can't massage their own back.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, how
about for other people?

00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:10%
>>MIRZA: For other people how I
tap in is I have to get quiet.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.650 align:middle line:90%
There is a very--

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:84%
there is no magic
word, George, to get

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:90%
your psychic intuition going.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:90%
It's really no words.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a place of being quiet.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a place where
even musicians go to.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:90%
They have to drop in.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:90%
And then they're able to play.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:84%
An artist has to drop in,
and then she's able to paint.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
For me as a medium,
I have to drop in.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.168 align:middle line:84%
And that simply means is that
I have to become so loose--

00:07:28.168 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and when I trance
channel-- a lot of people

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.580 align:middle line:84%
think when I trance channel,
because the guides come in

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.455 align:middle line:90%
with this big energy.

00:07:32.455 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Like Red Eagle, who
is a Native American/tree,

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:90%
I like to say.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:84%
He's this mix of a tree and
maybe some Indigenous tribal

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:90%
He always makes this joke that--

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.248 align:middle line:84%
I said, why did you pick
to channel through me?

00:07:44.248 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, so people get two
Indians for the price of one.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: So he has this big
energy that comes through.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And people think, oh, you
have to really brace yourself

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
for this big spirit
guide to come through.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
But really I have to be
very much in my feminine--

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:90%
I have to be really gentle.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:90%
I have to be really quiet.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And to get people
to do that means--

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:84%
for me to teach
them how to connect

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to their own
intuition-- it means

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.408 align:middle line:84%
they have to be
able to feel safe.

00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's really hard
for a lot of people to do.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yeah.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I come from when
I'm doing my psychic readings.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It just comes to me, man.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.305 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know sometimes
why they make me say something.

00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget, one
of my first readings--

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting giving
a reading to someone,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
and out of nowhere I started
thinking about frozen Twinkies.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember when we used
to freeze Twinkies as kids?

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.872 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: And I'm thinking,
Riz, get yourself focused.

00:08:37.872 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Stop thinking about it.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Focus. stop thinking
about frozen Twinkies.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: I just took a chance.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:90%
I was a baby psychic then.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.240 align:middle line:90%
And I just said--

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
the woman's sister
had passed away.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I feel
like I'm supposed

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:90%
to talk about frozen Twinkies.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was it!

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:90%
She burst into tears.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God!

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Because this was the
favorite moment for the two

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.030 align:middle line:84%
sisters was when they
would freeze the Twinkies.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Right?

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And they would
write their names--

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's no
way you would know that!

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: There's no
way I would know that.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.245 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I
could know that.

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's not mind reading.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:90%
It is simply a mystery.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I always say, after all
my classes, my workshops--

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:90%
15 years of this--

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:90%
listen, guys.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It's the mystery.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Keep the magic.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Keep some mystery.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Even though what
we're doing when

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:84%
we have this intuitive
ability to sense--

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:90%
it actually is a type of--

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:90%
I call it an inner technology.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Riz, you performed
live psychic readings

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
on Melrose Avenue
in Los Angeles.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:90%
And we have it on tape.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: What's
mom's first name?

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Rita.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: So-- Rita?

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: So on Rita's side
there is a Charles energy

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:90%
coming through.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Also I have to talk about--

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
diabetes in this
side of the family.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Who's that?

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My dad.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Your dad.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
And where is he?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Dead.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: OK.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to
be coming through.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:90%
So dad has passed on.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we talked about
mom, I felt diabetes.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:10%
But that's dad.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:10%
That usually means that mom
is our kind of connector

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:10%
energetically-- if
that makes sense--

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:10%
to dad.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
There's also a Ronald
connected to him.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:90%
So Ron-- Ronnie.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Who's that?

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Father-in-law.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.285 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Father-in-law.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Thank you.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And is he passed also?

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:90%
But he's, like, up there in age.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: OK.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Your dad is actually mentioning
this person right now.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.693 align:middle line:84%
And that usually means
that eventually it's

00:10:32.693 --> 00:10:34.360 align:middle line:84%
also going to be his
time to cross over.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:84%
As you said, he's
up there in age.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And your dad--

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I know this may not
make sense to you--

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:84%
because we think of in terms
of on earth, like, who are we

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:90%
friends with.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know that person.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes in a reading
what we're tuning into

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:90%
is the other side.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side
they see everything

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:90%
and they're connected.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.917 align:middle line:84%
So there'll be someone on
the father's side connected

00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
to someone on the mother's
side, even though they're not

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:84%
blood related and
maybe never even met.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
so interesting.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.368 align:middle line:84%
Who in that family was gearing
towards law enforcement?

00:11:05.368 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was a cop.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: He was a cop.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:90%
He said law enforcement.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.249 align:middle line:90%
So now you know it's him, OK.

00:11:12.249 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:90%
He was a warrior of one kind.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And that warrior blood
runs through you, brother.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:90%
It runs through you.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Law enforcement is
here to help peace.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Keep the peace.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:90%
And you're the same.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:84%
You're here to help keep
the peace on this earth.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Just by being you.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And don't be afraid
to let this power out.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.935 align:middle line:84%
Remember like in
Marvel Comics, Iron Man

00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:84%
had that light coming from
the center of his chest.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:90%
That's how I see you.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:84%
That light comes from
the center of your chest.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.807 align:middle line:90%
And you are here to do it.

00:11:43.807 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
do it, because you

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:90%
have no other choice.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a choice.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:84%
The other choice is that you
cave in and sink into yourself,

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and you never quite get there.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
You never bust out with
all of your abilities

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:90%
and your talents.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And so dad is coming through
to let you know about that.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So he dedicated himself
to helping the people.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And you just need to dedicate
yourself to helping the people.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Once we do that, you're
great no matter what happens.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Because your greatness
comes from this.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.507 align:middle line:84%
That's the only place
greatness comes from.

00:12:17.507 --> 00:12:18.501 align:middle line:90%
[SNIFFLING]

00:12:18.501 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: So thank you for--

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: --for that.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your
accuracy is uncanny.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Uncanny.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: I'm grateful.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it shows how
emotional some of these people

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
get when you tell
them these things.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: When you're
recovering from grief when

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:84%
you lose someone,
you can go to therapy

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:90%
for five years, 10 years.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going to therapy and--

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm not here to knock therapy.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But when you get a mediumship
reading it's in five minutes.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:84%
You say a name and you say
the person's profession.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're here to
give this message.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:90%
That's undeniable.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:90%
That's a magical experience.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.040 align:middle line:90%
And that heals you so quickly.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Because you get
this confirmation

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:90%
that they're with you.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's there
on the other side

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:90%
telling you this information?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.997 align:middle line:84%
Was that, for example,
his dead father?

00:13:11.997 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: So this is
the way I hear it.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes I'll feel--

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:10%
I used to say a middleman
between me and the person.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that's an angel
or a spirit guide.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And that can happen
50% of the time.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Other times I feel
them-- it's almost

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:84%
like they're typing a
message in front of my face.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.657 align:middle line:90%
A mediumship reading is--

00:13:33.657 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:90%
here's what happens.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
When someone dies-- let's say
that we're alive, and here's

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:90%
them, and here's us.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:90%
We love them.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:90%
We're connected.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.888 align:middle line:84%
When they die, their vibration
invariably goes up spiritually.

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what belief system.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're religious,
or you're new age,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.362 align:middle line:84%
everyone believes that there's
an ascension that happens--

00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:50.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It goes up.

00:13:50.195 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: OK?

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:90%
They go up.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:90%
What happens to us?

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:90%
We go down.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.035 align:middle line:90%
Because we're sad.

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:55.835 align:middle line:90%
We're grieving.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're grieving.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: So look at
all this space now.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle line:84%
They're on FM 107,
and we are on 89.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.180 align:middle line:90%
So a medium is in the middle.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
The medium has no grief because
we don't see death the way

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:90%
other people do.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know this person.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.327 align:middle line:90%
So we're not grieving.

00:14:12.327 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:90%
This person is.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:90%
So we see them as more alive.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.847 align:middle line:90%
We can feel them still.

00:14:16.847 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Our vibrations is still up here.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.472 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They act alive to you.

00:14:19.472 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: They act alive to me.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:84%
They don't ever say
things like, I miss you.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I've never
encountered that once.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:90%
They see us.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:84%
They only want us to know that
we're going to see them again.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
They only want us to
know they're not mad.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I've never encountered
one loved one

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
who was angry that you weren't
there, like, when he died.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen that way.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:90%
It only feels bad for us.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So as a medium, what I want to
do with people when I give them

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:84%
readings, is give them
this accurate information,

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:84%
but also give them
something to work

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
with after I leave
that inspires them,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that sparks them,
to be who they are.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
you such a receptor

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:90%
for this kind of information?

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Oh.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.003 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're like an antenna.

00:15:06.003 --> 00:15:09.025 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: I'm a crazy mix of
being really shy and also

00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:09.825 align:middle line:90%
an extrovert.

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're shy?

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: I am.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I haven't seen
that side of you yet.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: There's a reason why.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm out here.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:10%
My shyness is where I'm
connected to my vulnerability,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:10%
especially when I was a kid.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.700 align:middle line:90%
I do think there's a gift.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.117 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's
some kids who

00:15:28.117 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
are born with a perfect
ear for the piano.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Why them?

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:90%
It's because it's an ability.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a sense we're born with.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now in that video,
you weren't channeling

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:90%
at that moment, were you.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: No.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's different.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: That's me.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that work?

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: I'm the
psychic receiving.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.037 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that work?

00:15:43.037 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: So channeling--
remember this one thing.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:90%
This word channel.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.095 align:middle line:90%
We watch TV channels.

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:90%
[DIAL CLICKING SOUND]

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.068 align:middle line:84%
Tuning into frequencies
flying through the air.

00:15:54.068 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:90%
They're flying through the air.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.777 align:middle line:84%
There's TV and radio stations
that are sending frequencies

00:15:57.777 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:90%
through the air.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:84%
We are such an amazing race of
beings that we figured out how

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:10.375 align:middle line:84%
to make a picture invisible,
how to make sound silent--

00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:84%
because that's what's happening
when you're watching TV--

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and we figured out how to
throw it through the air--

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And show
up someplace else.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: And show
up somewhere else.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And turn that invisible
picture into a visible picture.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Take that silent sound and
reproduce it exactly the way

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:90%
that it was sent out.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's-- is that technology?

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Is that magic?

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a magical technology.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a technical magic.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:90%
How did we make sound silent?

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:90%
See, that's where I start with.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're going to
actually consider the notion

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:84%
that somebody is
channeling spirit guides,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:90%
what if when I channel--

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and you see me channel, and
a different voice comes out,

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
a different accent comes out,
a different manner of being

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:84%
What if 100 years
from now there's

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
a camera that's pointed
at me like this one.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:90%
But this camera is so advanced.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:84%
How much more
advanced is the iPhone

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
than 100 years ago from
whatever phone was there?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: OK.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:90%
So there's no comparison.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.202 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what will it
be 100 years from now?

00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: It might
be a camera that

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.372 align:middle line:84%
can see a spirit energy
coming into the channeler.

00:17:13.372 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Why not?

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine trying to
explain to Abraham Lincoln

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:20.920 align:middle line:90%
the iPhone?

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Now he was probably the most
intelligent man of his time.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:90%
So if--

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he wouldn't get it.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yeah.

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
What if you and I, George,
went back in time just dressed

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
the way we are?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.900 align:middle line:84%
We're in clothes
that, in some way,

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:90%
were the clothes of back then.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:90%
A suit and shirt.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And you go back into
Lincoln's office.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:90%
We appear.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Time travelers.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And we say, Mr. Lincoln,
pleased to meet you.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:90%
We want to show you something.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:90%
And we show him the iPhone.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Now he might
recognize it as glass.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Made of some iron,
he might think.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we say, would you like
to see the Great Wall of China

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to see the
inside of a kangaroo growing

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:90%
in his mother's pouch?

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he'd say,
what are you talking about?

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Would you like to see
a sperm fertilizing the egg?

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.430 align:middle line:90%
In that little box?

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And we show it to him.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: We pop on YouTube.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:90%
And then we say--

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:90%
he says, how--

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.288 align:middle line:84%
I know there's no little
kangaroo in there.

00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I know the Great
Wall of China is not

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:84%
in this little box
of metal and glass.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you and I have to
tell him, well, Mr. Lincoln.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
This little box is
talking to another box

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.220 align:middle line:90%
that's flying around the Earth.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He wouldn't understand.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:84%
You have channeled over 100
spirit entities in your career.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Who are some of them?

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Some of them have
been very famous names.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:90%
I've channeled Nikola Tesla.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yes.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:90%
I've channeled some composers.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I have channeled
Charles Dickens.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:90%
I've channeled Shakespeare.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.942 align:middle line:90%
I've channeled Charlie Chaplin.

00:18:49.942 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:10%
Some of these are in my book.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.567 align:middle line:10%
I have a book
called "The 9 Keys."

00:18:52.567 --> 00:18:53.787 align:middle line:10%
And each chapter--

00:18:53.787 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to say I wrote
it, but I didn't write it.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:10%
I channeled each
chapter while in trance.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:90%
We set a recorder.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I go into trance.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:90%
The guide comes through.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:90%
We record it.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Then we just transcribe
it and publish it.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.635 align:middle line:90%
There's no editing.

00:19:08.635 --> 00:19:09.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it goes.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So Charlie Chaplin came through
and gave a whole chapter

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:90%
on what humor is.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Some spirit guides
have names we've never heard of.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Phineas Crumby, right?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Quimby.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
we've got you on tape

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
with Phineas and Red Eagle
that you just mentioned.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Really?

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look.

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:29.080 align:middle line:10%
>>MIRZA: Now we'll begin an om.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:10%
You will join me.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:10%
Just match the note
as best as you can.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.888 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.888 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:10%
And then after that,
I'll say goodbye

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:10%
and they will say hello.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.387 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.387 --> 00:19:43.345 align:middle line:10%
(IN VAGUELY BRITISH
ACCENT) My name is Phineas.

00:19:43.345 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:10%
There are some who feel
that to gain perspective,

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:10%
you must be in another position.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:10%
That you must end somewhere else
to understand where you are.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:10%
Then by some stretch of your
mental or spiritual capacity,

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:10%
you are able to see yourself
or others from a perspective

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:10%
to give yourself a deeper or
wider understanding of what

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.345 align:middle line:10%
is occurring.

00:20:24.345 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:10%
(IN VAGUELY NATIVE AMERICAN
ACCENT) I like to talk.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:10%
I come here tonight.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:28.960 align:middle line:10%
We come.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:10%
We talk about vision.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:10%
You need an equal vision.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:10%
You can see from far
away a little mouse.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:10%


00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:10%
The eagle does not
strain her eyes.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:10%
She has surrendered
to vision itself.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:10%
Meaning everything is accepted.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:10%


00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:10%
And nothing rejected.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:10%
Nothing is rejected at all.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.485 align:middle line:10%
Everything that's in
the vision is accepted.

00:20:57.485 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:10%
That clarity.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.160 align:middle line:10%
That precision.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:10%
You say, I want that.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:10%
I want to see better.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:10%
I want to communicate
with my guides this year.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:10%
I want to know it.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:10%
How do you know your guides
are not communicating

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.283 align:middle line:10%
to you all the time?

00:21:14.283 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:10%
You say, well, I can't feel it.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.740 align:middle line:10%
Alright, simple.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:10%
To hear you have to quiet down.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:10%
If you want to hear, you want to
listen, you have to be silent.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:10%
Same letters in those two words.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:10%
Silent.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:10%
Listen.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.253 align:middle line:90%
I actually have never seen that.

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: I used to not be
able to watch myself channel.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.396 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: It is.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.315 align:middle line:84%
It's a very strange phenomenon
that one lives with.

00:21:45.315 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get
tired after your channel?

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: I used to, but
actually now it energizes me.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.047 align:middle line:90%
You have to be--

00:21:51.047 --> 00:21:52.380 align:middle line:90%
it's a stamina you have to have.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.130 align:middle line:84%
I've channeled-- five and a
half hours I've been in trance.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:10%
And remember, this is like
going to sleep for me.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:10%
It's a very active dream state.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:10%
And I'll still sleep
that same night.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I can channel for five
hours, and then go home,

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.983 align:middle line:84%
and then sleep
another eight hours.

00:22:07.983 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It regenerates you.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: It regenerates you.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
psychic abilities too?

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: I do.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Like on that video that I
have on my YouTube channel,

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:84%
which is called "The Magical
Life With Riz Mirza."

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I did that because I
wanted people to see really

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:90%
authentic people I'm reading.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:84%
People that would normally
not even get psychic readings.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I would just pick
a night and go out

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:84%
into the streets of L.A.
and just talk to them.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I like to show
my whole process,

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:84%
because there are some psychics
on television that will only

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:84%
show you the most perfect
answer that they gave,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.728 align:middle line:84%
and leave out 20 things
that they missed.

00:22:41.728 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:84%
If something doesn't
connect with someone--

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You lay it right out.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:46.547 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: I lay it out.

00:22:46.547 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Because, number one, it may
make sense to them later.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I've had people send me
emails after I give them

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.702 align:middle line:84%
readings where they say, I
loved everything you said.

00:22:54.702 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
that was spot on.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
These two things
didn't ring a bell.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.075 align:middle line:84%
But a year later,
two years later--

00:23:00.075 --> 00:23:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happens.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.533 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Something happens
that I said out of left field

00:23:03.533 --> 00:23:07.092 align:middle line:84%
that they were
completely bewildered by.

00:23:07.092 --> 00:23:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Two years later
I'll get the email,

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and say, Riz, you don't
remember me but, hey--

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You said this,
and this happened.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Yeah, I am,
like, in clown school now.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
Red Eagle and what you've

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:90%
learned from him.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Red Eagle.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:90%
What do I say about him?

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
He has spoken to thousands
and thousands of people.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.732 align:middle line:90%
And I-- remember something.

00:23:28.732 --> 00:23:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I didn't come from a
background of being raised

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.000 align:middle line:90%
by psychics or channelers.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I was just doing my
thing, playing music,

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
screaming on stage in
bands, watching WWF.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.683 align:middle line:84%
People say, what are
your psychic influences?

00:23:41.683 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
I name the heavy metal
bands I was into,

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:90%
and I name WWF wrestlers.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were a heavy
metal musician, weren't you?

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yeah.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I still am, actually.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: You can't--
music can never leave you.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.838 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's in there.

00:23:51.838 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: That's my
first channel, though!

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.370 align:middle line:84%
That's where I opened up to
music, is where-- frequency.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.050 align:middle line:84%
That's what psychics
and mediums do.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:84%
They're students and
masters of frequency.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Just like these cameras are
picking up our frequency

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
because the light is
reflecting off of us.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Turn the lights off,
there's no more frequency

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
to be picked up
by these cameras.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:90%
So spirit guides are around us.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.790 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
culture you come from.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:10%
It does not matter what
religious background

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:10%
or tribal culture.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:84%
There is always a
reference to that:

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:90%
each human being is not alone.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.200 align:middle line:10%
So they are-- what
you can call them

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:10%
spirit guides, or ancestors,
or the universe, or awareness.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:90%
The watchers, people call them.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the ETs
if that's what they--

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes these
entities, Riz, come to you?

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Or do you summon them?

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Like Red Eagle?

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Great question.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.540 align:middle line:84%
For some reason when
I sit down to channel

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:84%
at the circle of light, Red
Eagle has never disappointed.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:84%
He's always shown
up to give messages.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's ready to go.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.555 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: He's
always ready to go.

00:24:56.555 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Phineas shows up.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.880 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned
through just meditation

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and receiving the
information, is

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
that I had some past
life connection to them.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Now Red Eagle, he comes
across-- you see, well, it's--

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:84%
oh, he has a bit of a
Native American in him.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's no such thing as an
ethnicity with a spirit guide.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.360 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as an
ethnicity with a spirit guide.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:90%
A spirit guide is like us.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Our soul is made of light.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:84%
We have all been
other ethnicities.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.225 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: I looked like
you, maybe, last time.

00:25:26.225 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe last lifetime
you looked like me.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Or we were women
that looked Asian.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:90%
So they tend to choose the soul.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The spirit guide chooses
the avatar through which,

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:90%
maybe, people will listen more.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Phineas seems to have
a British accent.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's because we tend
to think of British people

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and the perfection of their
pronunciation and enunciation

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.740 align:middle line:90%
of English as very learned.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Red Eagle is very earthy,
so he comes through

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:90%
in his tribal form.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:84%
But maybe his name
is Elizabeth and he

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:90%
was a queen in some past life.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: You don't know.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.250 align:middle line:90%
We don't know, you see.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But I say, even if you don't
believe in spirit guides

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:84%
or channeling, if you're
hearing a message--

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through me or
it's through your horoscope,

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:90%
or written on a fortune cookie--

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:84%
if you let it land on you,
maybe it can help you.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Riz, during a
channeling session, generally

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.878 align:middle line:90%
how long does it go?

00:26:21.878 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Generally about two
and a half to three hours.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So people come to
see me twice a week.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Two and a half to three hours.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Everyone gets a
message at my circles.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Most channelings are just--

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.770 align:middle line:84%
there are wisdom circles and
channelers give the messages.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.740 align:middle line:84%
But I give personal messages
to each person who comes.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
channel at will?

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.535 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yes.

00:26:42.535 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
do something now?

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: We sure can.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now who
will we channel?

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Or do you know that?

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: I don't.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.060 align:middle line:84%
But I have a feeling
it's Phineas.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Get into your mode, and
then we'll just chat.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: It might be Red Eagle.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.505 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.505 --> 00:26:59.305 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you later.

00:26:59.305 --> 00:27:02.957 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.957 --> 00:27:05.000 align:middle line:84%
(IN VAGUELY BRITISH
ACCENT) I'm Phineas.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.277 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Phineas, it's
good to talk to you again.

00:27:08.277 --> 00:27:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: It is a pleasure
for us to be here.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
talking to me on the radio show?

00:27:12.485 --> 00:27:13.635 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Indeed.

00:27:13.635 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us a little
bit more about you.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:90%
When did you live?

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Incarnations
are infinite.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
When one is in the
in-between space,

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:84%
as you may refer to where
spirit guides reside--

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and residing, of course,
is used by the terminology

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:84%
in your own English, for all
of us are connected as one.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:84%
As far as incarnations
are concerned,

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.890 align:middle line:84%
there were certain
lifetimes where perhaps you

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.190 align:middle line:84%
were familiar with
the name of Phineas.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Though, as to my
own recollection,

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:84%
you must understand
that there are

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
bits and pieces of that
particular expression,

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:84%
the identity, that remain
known to me and some

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:90%
that is not known to me.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:84%
As Phineas, I was a descendant
of a teacher named Eleazar

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:84%
who, in certain times,
was a teacher returning

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
in various incarnations
as an ordinary person

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
that you might describe
living an ordinary life.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:10%
But the lifetimes that
were important for us

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:10%
were the ones where
we were sharing

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:10%
this information of the creation
and the nature of reality.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And so as you refer to
myself as Mr. Quimby,

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm simply known as Phineas.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And I have experienced
various wardrobes or costumes

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:84%
in my collection that I
don to connect with you.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would think that
you are in the 1800s garb

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.060 align:middle line:90%
right about now.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Is that a pretty accurate guess?

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: The garb that we
are wearing is one of energy.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Though, through that intention,
we may create any visual

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.230 align:middle line:84%
that is appropriate
for the transmission.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:84%
If we were to connect
with a person who

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.080 align:middle line:84%
is of a certain culture,
their own cultural references

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
would be projected
and understood

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:07.270 align:middle line:84%
by us, and therefore, in a
meditation or a dream state,

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:90%
a spirit guide may appear.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And that guide will be
adorned or wearing clothes

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:84%
you might say, in
your terminology, that

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.870 align:middle line:84%
would be appropriate so that
the message is understood.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, you would not wish
to see an archangel dressed

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.370 align:middle line:90%
as a clown.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Though a child may
need the spirit guide

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to show up as a clown,
for they regard the clown

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.610 align:middle line:90%
as a loving and safe being.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:84%
They may not understand
a person in a robe.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar with our
technology of this era

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:90%
that I'm in?

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Indeed.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it fascinate you?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: What is fascinating?

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
have television sets.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.520 align:middle line:90%
We have phones.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I can send a friend
of mine who may

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:84%
be living 2,000
miles away a picture

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.795 align:middle line:84%
that they will receive on
their telephone instantly.

00:29:59.795 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: You see,
your technology

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:06.320 align:middle line:84%
represents a larger expression
of your abilities within you.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Your computers represent the
calculations and processes

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that are currently
within your own mind.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:10%
For example, you are able
to recite poetry and verses

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:10%
while perhaps even doing
an equation of mathematics.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:84%
You are also at the
same time-- currently,

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.350 align:middle line:84%
you are able to take in
the sound of the voice that

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.933 align:middle line:84%
is coming through
the channel, as well

00:30:28.933 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
as the lighting from
your left and right,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:84%
as well as the feeling of
your feet in your shoes.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:90%
You see, you are multitasking.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.320 align:middle line:90%
You are a processor.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Your technology represents
your inner technology.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And so to be able to
send a picture or words,

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:48.430 align:middle line:84%
look at the very fascinating
phenomenon of twins.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.390 align:middle line:84%
They are able to-- being
separated miles apart--

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.450 align:middle line:84%
send each other-- or
whether it is consciously,

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.480 align:middle line:84%
or unconsciously, one
twin may feel the emotions

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.890 align:middle line:90%
that the other is feeling.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.840 align:middle line:84%
There have been many
cases where one twin

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
on the opposite
side of the world

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.710 align:middle line:84%
may feel a sudden
pain in their body.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:10%
And their twin has just
injured the same spot

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.860 align:middle line:10%
at the very same time in
another part of the world.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:10%
One may say that this
is a transmission.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And one may say this is
automatic connection.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Phineas, why do you
channel through Riz Mirza?

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:84%
What is so special about him
that allows you to do this?

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Most
transmissions that occur

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to the potency of certain
full trance channels,

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:84%
as you have begun to
call this technology.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.870 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you
regard this channeling

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.570 align:middle line:84%
as a magical gift
that is wonderful,

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.420 align:middle line:84%
but also to see it
as a technology--

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.110 align:middle line:84%
because you do have an
antenna inside of you.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:49.870 align:middle line:10%
For example, you are able
to focus at this moment

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:10%
while the channel is speaking
with the voice of Phineas.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You are also able to hear
the tone in the room.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you decided that you were
going to listen to his voice,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.170 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time raise
the volume of the background

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:84%
of the studio, you would be
able to do so, wouldn't you?

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Through the power
of your intention.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.690 align:middle line:84%
You would also be able to think
of your bedroom right now.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.300 align:middle line:84%
As you are looking upon Riz,
think of your own bedroom

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.110 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.450 align:middle line:10%
So you are able to do
very different things

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.200 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, the technology that you
have within you, the capacity,

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.650 align:middle line:90%
let us say, to sing a song.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Some are more
musically inclined.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.940 align:middle line:84%
The natural gifts
that Riz possesses,

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:31.030 align:middle line:84%
or channels like him, is
his ability to surrender.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:35.350 align:middle line:84%
You see, surrender is your key
for a very powerful expression

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.500 align:middle line:90%
of who you are.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:84%
You do not need to
change who you are.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And the thrust of our
transmission and messages

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to all of you who listen is so
that you surrender to the truth

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and to the magic
that is within you.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:10%
As you do that, as
you are removing

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:10%
these layers from yourself
by surrendering to them,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.420 align:middle line:10%
by removing any notions of blame
or victimhood or frustration

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.070 align:middle line:10%
with the world, and
you begin to let go,

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.770 align:middle line:10%
then that which is
within you begins

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:01.840 align:middle line:10%
to surface and be
seen by others.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:90%
But especially by you.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is what makes
a fulfilling life.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.645 align:middle line:84%
An expression
while you are here.

00:33:07.645 --> 00:33:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Phineas,
can you kind of

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:84%
describe for us the
area that you're in now?

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Let us then
speak of dimensions,

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:84%
for it is very common
now for people to speak,

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that they went to
another dimension.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And that multidimensions,
that dimensions

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:29.320 align:middle line:84%
are over there, or across a
vast distance of time and space.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But you see, dimensions
are here and now.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.335 align:middle line:84%
We are not in a
separate space than you.

00:33:35.335 --> 00:33:38.640 align:middle line:84%
You see, there are
particles in this air

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:90%
that you are unable to see.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.860 align:middle line:84%
There are sounds that are above
the frequency of your ear.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Your dog will be able to hear
frequencies that you cannot,

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: Now what if we were
to tell you that using your own

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:84%
logic, and your own
observation of scientific fact,

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that your dog can hear
frequencies that you cannot?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.662 align:middle line:90%
Let us use that logic.

00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Then it is possible that there
are frequencies of light you

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.332 align:middle line:90%
also cannot see.

00:34:03.332 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Phineas,
is there anything

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that you wish you
would have done

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.710 align:middle line:90%
when you were a physical being?

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: It is a fair question.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Looking back upon my studies
in the particular lifetime

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:84%
that you are referring to,
where a certain type of thought

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:27.600 align:middle line:84%
was encouraged by my earthly
self, to be kinder to myself,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.449 align:middle line:84%
to know that the knowledge
that was to come through

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:84%
was for the people, and to not
try to control it too much.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.139 align:middle line:90%
To doubt myself.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And as I emerged--

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:84%
that meant, as I died and
went into my higher self.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:90%
My more expansive reality--

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.110 align:middle line:90%
this realization occurred.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:51.340 align:middle line:84%
We suggest that you do not wait
that long to do it yourselves.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.576 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Phineas, can I chat
for a moment with Red Eagle?

00:34:54.576 --> 00:34:55.659 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: A moment, please.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:35:02.793 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.793 --> 00:35:06.140 align:middle line:84%
(IN VAGUELY NATIVE AMERICAN
ACCENT) Hey, hello.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Red Eagle?

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yep.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:08.407 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hello, there.

00:35:08.407 --> 00:35:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Hello.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about you.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Who is Red Eagle?

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.065 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: We are you.

00:35:15.065 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:84%
That means that we are not
surrendered to some idea

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.820 align:middle line:90%
that we are separate.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.350 align:middle line:90%
We are one with you.

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.585 align:middle line:84%
You will only know this
when you awaken to this.

00:35:25.585 --> 00:35:28.620 align:middle line:90%


00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:90%
But we are the guide to Riz.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.960 align:middle line:90%
We know him.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:90%
We are with him.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you select him
because of his abilities?

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: His ability
is to love himself.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:90%
His ability is to love others.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:84%
The ability is that where
do we see one is open.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.320 align:middle line:90%
And he needs it.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So if he needs it,
we go there, too.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.240 align:middle line:90%
For the teachings are for him.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:90%
The teachings are for others.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.590 align:middle line:90%
But I like his body.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.070 align:middle line:84%
It is the right size for
Red Eagle to come through.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He seems
like a nice guy.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yep.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And so do you.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: (CHUCKLING) Good.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.480 align:middle line:84%
To be called a guy, it
is good to hear that.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Because that means
you understand

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:90%
that it come from love.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And it is that we are
the friends of you.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:90%
We walk with you.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:90%
All of you.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will there be peace
on this planet, Red Eagle?

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: There is more peace
on the planet than war.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere there is
more peace than war.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:90%
But it is what you will learn.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.260 align:middle line:84%
All the teachers,
all the healers

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.470 align:middle line:84%
have told you that you must
be at peace with yourself.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:84%
You cannot see others
as separate from you.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Look at what is
happening in the prisons.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We talk for a moment
about prisons.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you were to
call them something else.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.578 align:middle line:84%
Let us say that you
begin to understand

00:36:49.578 --> 00:36:51.120 align:middle line:84%
that the way you
talk about the world

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.330 align:middle line:84%
will reflect the way
you see the world.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.430 align:middle line:84%
You see prisons are full
of very hurt people.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.335 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree, or not?

00:36:58.335 --> 00:36:59.253 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:36:59.253 --> 00:37:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: It is unprocessed--

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And people
who have hurt.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: They have hurt
because they are hurt.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.690 align:middle line:84%
You do not have happy
people hurting other people.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So what you see is
a holding center

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.860 align:middle line:84%
for people with
unprocessed trauma.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.660 align:middle line:90%
Imagine!

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You had to use a lot
of words to say that.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.570 align:middle line:90%
It is not a prison.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It is a holding center for
people with unprocessed trauma.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.100 align:middle line:84%
But you may then
have more compassion

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand how you people
are creating your reality.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.610 align:middle line:90%
The peace that you seek--

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.080 align:middle line:84%
many teachers have
told you, when

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.600 align:middle line:84%
you realize that love is
the only real power, that

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:90%
is the solution all the time.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.568 align:middle line:84%
You want your plant
to grow, more love.

00:37:33.568 --> 00:37:34.860 align:middle line:90%
You want your children to grow?

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:90%
More love.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.800 align:middle line:84%
You want anything
to grow, more love.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Once you have more love,
you will feed everybody.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you interact
with other entities

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife?

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yes.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.500 align:middle line:84%
We have many, you may
call them, friends.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:54.320 align:middle line:84%
As a spirit guide, it is
a tough job and easy job.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Because easy job
because it is love.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Tough job because it is love.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Love is everything, is it not?

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So we are assigned
to certain people.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.680 align:middle line:90%
You have guides, too.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.870 align:middle line:84%
You have guides that work
with you, that guide you.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:84%
That you sometimes think
they're there to fix everything.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.890 align:middle line:84%
They're not there
to fix everything.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:84%
They are there to
whisper into your ear.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Go a little to the left, George.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Go little to the right.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:15.620 align:middle line:90%
This way.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Think of that person.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Call them.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:90%
We help you to understand.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.290 align:middle line:90%
We do not give you a fish.

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:22.460 align:middle line:90%
We give you a fishing pole.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Teach you how to fish.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is my reality real?

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: The only reality
that you're going to know,

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.760 align:middle line:84%
George, no matter
what you see around

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.440 align:middle line:84%
you-- we take you
from this chair,

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.967 align:middle line:90%
put you on another planet.

00:38:35.967 --> 00:38:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And you look at everybody else,
maybe you will look different.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.540 align:middle line:10%
But the only reality will be
how you feel inside of yourself.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Because tonight, George,
you will go to sleep.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:90%
You will dream.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.510 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of your
dream, you're not

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:90%
going to remember this studio.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.110 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
think it is not real.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Wherever it is you are in
your dream, that will be real.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%
How many times you
have woken up and said,

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I cannot believe
that was a dream?

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.220 align:middle line:90%
I could feel pain.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:90%
I could feel pleasure.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.400 align:middle line:90%
I knew this person.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I knew that person.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Every time you wake up, you
say, I cannot believe it was

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.040 align:middle line:90%
a dream.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.900 align:middle line:84%
You know how many times
you have done that?

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Many, many times.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many times.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Many times.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And all the people watching
this, they have done it.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And they are going to fall
for this again tonight.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:84%
They are going to do it
again when they go to sleep.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.550 align:middle line:90%
So where is the reality?

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Now the logic you have is
that this is real because, oh!

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:90%
It is the same studio.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I am George again.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he is that guy.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:30.680 align:middle line:90%
He is that guy.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.170 align:middle line:84%
That is your only
evidence that this--

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.600 align:middle line:84%
for you it is evidence
that this is real,

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and that was just a dream.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But when you die, this
whole life will be a dream.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Because now you will
be somewhere else.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.690 align:middle line:84%
That is why we teach you
the nature of reality.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.230 align:middle line:84%
We teach you that reality
is that you are constantly

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:middle line:90%
creating it with how you feel.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.420 align:middle line:84%
What difference does it make
if you're sitting in prison--

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and there are many who sit
in prison and feel very free,

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.180 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:84%
While there are people
walking around here and--

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.340 align:middle line:90%
free?

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.860 align:middle line:90%
They don't feel free.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Are we unique in this universe?

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: You are very
unique in this universe.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:90%
And we will tell you why.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:12.540 align:middle line:90%
You strive.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.000 align:middle line:90%
The people on the planet strive.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.470 align:middle line:84%
You create ideas to live up to
them, because inside of you,

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:24.760 align:middle line:84%
just like the laws, inside
of you you feel what is good

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.810 align:middle line:90%
and just and right.

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:27.280 align:middle line:90%
So you create things.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:90%
And then you reach up into them.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Like your laws,
like your beliefs.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.400 align:middle line:90%
You want to rise to something.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is why other forces,
other energies, other entities

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.030 align:middle line:84%
you may call them,
see this planet,

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and they see you
evolving very fast.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You evolve even
socially very fast.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Look at the differences from
100, 200 years ago, to today.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.170 align:middle line:10%
Now war is going to
be there because you

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:54.580 align:middle line:10%
have a kind of contrast
power struggle on Earth.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.600 align:middle line:10%
Earth is a school.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.460 align:middle line:84%
The school is so that you
understand what is real power.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Riz-- can
we have Riz back?

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yep.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.660 align:middle line:10%
Be well.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.162 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you feel?

00:41:18.162 --> 00:41:20.245 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: (IN NORMAL VOICE)
Well, you know, doing--

00:41:20.245 --> 00:41:21.045 align:middle line:90%
(CHUCKLES).

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Give me a moment.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.260 align:middle line:90%
I feel good.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.730 align:middle line:90%
It happens very fast.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I dealt with
Phineas and Red Eagle.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yeah, I knew.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:29.562 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: I knew.

00:41:29.562 --> 00:41:35.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you watch people
channel like that, and you go,

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:36.820 align:middle line:90%
what is going on?

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Once you get past how they talk,
and you listen to the message--

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.690 align:middle line:84%
see, I always tell people,
listen to the message.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't get distracted by things.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Even in life-- you
twist your ankle.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a
message in it for you.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Stop walking so fast.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Start paying attention.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:84%
But you get distracted
by the pain.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.300 align:middle line:84%
We get distracted even
when channelers channel

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.533 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know where
this is coming from.

00:42:05.533 --> 00:42:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I say, don't
worry about that.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.992 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you just listen
to what the message is?

00:42:08.992 --> 00:42:11.570 align:middle line:10%
That's what it's for anyway.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating work.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Red Eagle.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:14.840 align:middle line:90%
You feel him, though.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you go when
they are channeling into you?

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Jersey.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your mind?

00:42:23.625 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: No.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Where do I go?

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:30.977 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you, sometimes I'm
in a space that looks like--

00:42:30.977 --> 00:42:33.060 align:middle line:10%
I feel like I'm sitting
up in a tree looking down.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:37.292 align:middle line:84%
Like just now when we did it, I
was kind of up high back there.

00:42:37.292 --> 00:42:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just watching?

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.625 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: And
looking down I could

00:42:39.625 --> 00:42:42.490 align:middle line:84%
see kind of the shapes
of the tops of our heads.

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:46.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not allowed to talk.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And other times I
don't remember at all.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:50.828 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRZA: It's
literally like a nap.

00:42:50.828 --> 00:42:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I think Edgar Cayce
was like that, right?

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: Yeah.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It exhausted him.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:01.823 align:middle line:84%
What message do you have, Riz,
for people watching this show?

00:43:01.823 --> 00:43:03.240 align:middle line:10%
>>MIRZA: The message
that I have--

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:10%
and it has always been this--

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.390 align:middle line:10%
that self-mastery
is not when you

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:11.113 align:middle line:10%
learn how to master a skill.

00:43:11.113 --> 00:43:12.530 align:middle line:84%
That you're a great
tennis player,

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:14.613 align:middle line:84%
or you're a great accountant,
and you're a master.

00:43:14.613 --> 00:43:15.413 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:15.413 --> 00:43:16.760 align:middle line:90%
You've mastered that skill.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.560 align:middle line:10%
But that's not self-mastery.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.090 align:middle line:10%
What I want people
to know is that,

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:23.070 align:middle line:10%
if you're interested
in self-mastery,

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:27.630 align:middle line:10%
in my teachings I say
self-mastery is when you are

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:10%
able to-- without moving from
where you are sitting right now

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:middle line:10%
as you're watching
or listening to us--

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.130 align:middle line:10%
that you're able to shift from
feeling bad to feeling good

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:38.390 align:middle line:10%
pretty quickly.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:84%
That you're able to shift
your energy, your mood,

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.950 align:middle line:84%
your emotional
state inside of you.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Because that is what's going to
tarnish or embellish everything

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:49.140 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.120 align:middle line:90%
What is this lens?

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Because your entire life is your
reaction and your perspective

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.010 align:middle line:90%
on everything.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get ahold of you?

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: RizMirza.com

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spell that out for us.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always posting
really fun stuff

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.965 align:middle line:90%
and how to get ahold of me.

00:44:09.965 --> 00:44:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stay
healthy, my friend.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: You too.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MIRZA: It's a pleasure.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:17.177 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's amazing
to talk to someone

00:44:17.177 --> 00:44:21.540 align:middle line:10%
who actually channels
someone who has departed

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.120 align:middle line:10%
in such a coherent way.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one day Riz
will channel me.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
