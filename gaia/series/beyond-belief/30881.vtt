>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.070 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.590 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: And now, the host
of the nationally syndicated

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast AM" and Gaiam
TV bring you Beyond Belief

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Hey,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
In my lifetime, I have had many
friends and many great guests

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:90%
that appear on my radio show.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
person in particular

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
who just continues
to mesmerize me.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:90%
He's a psychic.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.410 align:middle line:90%
He's an intuitive.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:90%
He's a counselor.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Please welcome Joseph Jacobs.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.839 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hey, Joe,
great to see you.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.749 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSEPH JACOBS:
Good to see you too.

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
when you're on me,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:90%
you're always on the phone.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's great to finally
see you in person.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:90%
We meet once in a blue moon.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And you know I
haven't done a public appearance

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:90%
like this for over 15 years.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.654 align:middle line:90%
But I feel bolder today.

00:01:22.654 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.486 align:middle line:90%
You hibernate?

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yes.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Psychic.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:90%
What is a psychic?

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You know, a psychic--
you say what is a doctor?

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:84%
A doctor can be a foot doctor,
a hand doctor, a dentist.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And so it is with psychics.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
There are people
who are clairvoyant.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they see images
when they're reading somebody.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So if they're reading
somebody and they'll say

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:90%
are you going on a trip?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
See, they'll ask
a question, which

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.547 align:middle line:84%
skeptics would say
they're fishing.

00:01:56.547 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: But they may
see a pigeon flying.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:90%
They're clairvoyant.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing
something, or a plane.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:90%
You're going on a trip.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Or are you expecting something?

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Then there are clairaudient
psychics, which I am.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.200 align:middle line:90%
I hear a quiet voice.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And there are con artists also.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But psychic is a
feeling that you have.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all
have that feeling?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Everybody is psychic
to some extent or other.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, it's like
anybody can learn to cook,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
but not everybody
is a great chef.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
So it takes practice.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:90%
It takes years.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:90%
There are no colleges.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
There are no certificates.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And so kind of a lot of psychics
are either born that way--

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.785 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: --or they
become autodidacts.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:90%
They teach themselves.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it genetic, Joseph?

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: I think
it is in my case.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:90%
My mother was psychic.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I grew up thinking
this was normal, you know?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.533 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did she teach you?

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:03.074 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: No.

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
No, in fact, all I did
was hear the stories

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and got some of her
intuitive ideas.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:84%
No, but I was
interested in astrology,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:90%
in comparative religion.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:90%
I was interested in numerology.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Although, the
numerology that I used

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:84%
multiplied numbers
instead of added them.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I would read people
who were friends.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I would do the I Ching.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I would do runes.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But I would interpret
it in my own way.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1979, I went
through a whole life change.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 40-- you know,
40 years through the desert

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.205 align:middle line:90%
to the promised land?

00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:46.663 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
the time of change.

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:47.415 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:90%
40 days of rain for Noah.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And I went through--
I started to cry.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%
I started to rove.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Everything started
to be messages to me,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:90%
license plates, whatever.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.826 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it that
emotional for you?

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:04.551 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: It was.

00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:90%
And I started to do psychometry.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And psychometry is another
form of psychic ability

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
where you touch an
object that somebody has,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to
get impressions.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So once I read
somebody, and I said

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.545 align:middle line:84%
I see a dark man
gave this to you.

00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And she said yes, he
was an African American.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And another time, I
see the color violet.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And she said Violet
gave it to me.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.619 align:middle line:84%
And I said she was a wonderful,
warm woman, but very sad.

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:90%
And then she told me why.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.323 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.323 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I was living
in Venice, California.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And I got to know all
the weirdos in Venice.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.559 align:middle line:84%
I'd lived there
for about a year.

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They hang
around the beach, right?

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the looniest
people down there

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
called me over one
day and just said

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:90%
you've got to talk to this guy.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So I walked over,
and here was this guy

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:84%
on the sand with a
blanket and books.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Long, gray beard, long gray hair
like a comic book guru, right.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.605 align:middle line:84%
And he said what's
your birthday?

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:90%
He was a British guy.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
And I said January 12th.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.035 align:middle line:84%
He said oh, you're
a two of spades.

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And I said yeah, right.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
walk away, right.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:90%
So he said no, no, no, no, no.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And he started to
rattle off information

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that nobody had ever told me,
no system had ever shown me.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And we got to be friends.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.110 align:middle line:90%
He liked to play backgammon.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
We commiserated
about our love lives.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:90%
We got together regularly.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me this card
system that he had discovered.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.787 align:middle line:90%
And then showed me the books.

00:05:44.787 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:90%
There were very few books.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
There were about three
books, at that point,

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
that had been written
about the cards.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.572 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And he would Xerox
stuff for me, and he even--

00:05:54.572 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was your teacher.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:90%
He was my teacher.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.418 align:middle line:84%
We never know who
our teachers are.

00:05:58.418 --> 00:06:00.755 align:middle line:84%
They can sometimes even
be an animal that we have.

00:06:00.755 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I know Shirley
MacLaine said that she

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:90%
liked to rescue animals.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:84%
She had a cat that
would bite her even

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:90%
when she was feeding her.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And she said it taught her
Christ's love, you know?

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: So sometimes the
people that we work with,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.740 align:middle line:84%
people that are families,
everything is a lesson.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And the cards system that
I use shows the lessons,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:84%
shows the progress
that we go through--

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to be
psychic to read those cards?

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: No, you don't.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But then I don't
refer the books.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, maybe
two or three times

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.262 align:middle line:84%
a year, I'll get a
particular birthday

00:06:42.262 --> 00:06:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that I haven't read
in a long time.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say I've
got a half hour.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I would take a half hour
to prepare for a reading.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.965 align:middle line:90%
And I'd take a look at the book.

00:06:49.965 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go well, yeah,
that makes sense.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to tell
them any of that.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I go from a
modern point of view.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
See, what happens when somebody
writes an astrological book,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
they're referring back to
other astrological books,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and their own
prejudices, and opinions,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:90%
or a numerological book.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.095 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happened with the cards.

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much gone from
"The Mystic Test Book," which

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
was written by Olney Richmond
in 1893, The Test Book.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.717 align:middle line:90%
In other words, we have tests.

00:07:23.717 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And that's
why he refers to it

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:84%
as the book of
seven thunders that

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:84%
is sweet to the
taste in Revelations.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Taste and test come
from the same root.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
He belonged to a group
of the Order of the Magi

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and believed that the card
system came through the Magi.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And then reading
that book, you're

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
not going to be able
to do a reading.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Then "Sacred Symbols
of the Ancients"

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
came out at around 1947 by Edith
Randall and Florence Campbell,

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:90%
no longer published.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And Florence Campbell
was a great numerologist

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.815 align:middle line:84%
who wrote "Your
Days are Numbered,"

00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:11.060 align:middle line:90%
which is seminal in numerology.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And that book gives
natal readings.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Then Arne Lein wrote
"What's Your Card?"

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:90%
No longer published.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.844 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:19.844 --> 00:08:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So most
of them are gone.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.885 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:08:21.885 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I worked
with Arne Lein.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And we co-chaired a workshop
for psychics and astrologers

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
who were crazy about
the card system,

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't figure it out,
and wanted to learn more.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.284 align:middle line:84%
Now, he came from
his point of view,

00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:84%
and I came from
my point of view,

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and we clashed a little bit.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But then Robert Camp
has written a few books.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And other people have come
along the Arne Lein line.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, but you
were spot on, Joseph.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:53.275 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing readings
for my audience for, gosh,

00:08:53.275 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:90%
it must be--

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: 15 years?

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --15 years now.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.664 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a
long, long time.

00:08:57.664 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Right.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I get more
response from you than anybody

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:84%
not only about the compassion,
but the accuracy that you have.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend of
mine who was going

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:90%
through a brutal relationship.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't know what to do.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said well,
call Joseph Jacobs.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.327 align:middle line:84%
Call him on his toll free
number, 1-800-see-self.

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: See self, right.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he did.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.605 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
together, 15 years later.

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Well, good.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, so I look
at you not only as a psychic,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:90%
but as a counselor.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
you've been able to do

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
is you have meshed
both of those,

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
the psychic, and the counselor,
and you've put it together.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, you know,
fortunately, I've had therapy.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And I would never go to a
psychic who hasn't had therapy.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And I would never
go to a therapist

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:90%
who wasn't spiritual either.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And so I see more of
a psychological and modern view

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:90%
of the cards.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, before my mother died,
I knew the cards at that point.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And I said what does this mean?

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And she would give me
a meaning for the card.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.765 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't.

00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:06.885 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say what
does this card mean?

00:10:06.885 --> 00:10:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I left it at that because
it didn't mean the same thing,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.652 align:middle line:90%
but she did it psychically.

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it work for her?

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.026 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: It worked for her.

00:10:14.026 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And I said how do you work?

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And in her accent,
she said I grab them.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Which means I become
one with them.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.582 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:23.582 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:90%
I could see her doing that.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.461 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And that's what
happens, even over the phone.

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we are all connected.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
We are separated
by our prejudices,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and our nationalities,
our races, and whatnot,

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.730 align:middle line:90%
but we're really all one.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And we are connected
even miles apart.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
The psychic energy travels
faster than the speed of light.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So that when-- I
work exclusively

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:84%
over the phone for
a number of reasons.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I start to talk
to somebody over the phone,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:90%
I connect with them.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And it is as if they
were in front of me.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And I see like a glow, or
a sadness, or a nervousness

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just the voice
because we all have an aura.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And that aura, it comes
right through the phone.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they afraid?

00:11:20.155 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Are they afraid of what
you're going to tell them?

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: People are
usually afraid, you know?

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:90%
And I don't do scary stuff.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't tell them
about death or stuff like that,

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:90%
do you?

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: No, but I tell them--

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they were
sick, would you tell them

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:90%
they're sick?

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.343 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, I'll tell
them this is a good time

00:11:34.343 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:90%
to see a doctor.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.709 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: OK.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you wouldn't say
you're going to die next week.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: No, you're
going through a time

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:84%
when you may experience other
people in your life going

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:90%
through a sadness.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen
death with someone?

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.359 align:middle line:84%
And they died in
a matter of weeks?

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: No.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.191 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's never happened?

00:11:53.191 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: I don't think we die.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.141 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
don't die that way.

00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: We don't die that way.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
That's our possessiveness
and our holding

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.629 align:middle line:90%
on to those we care about.

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to talk with
you more, Joseph, about the card

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:90%
system, how you do that.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
But let's take some questions
from you for Joseph Jacobs.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:90%
He's a great psychic.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.474 align:middle line:90%
You might have a question.

00:12:12.474 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to do
necessarily personal readings,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
but what do you want
to do here, Joe?

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, let me show
you what the cards say.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Can we do that?

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:22.483 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: All right.

00:12:22.483 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.467 align:middle line:90%
Here you have--

00:12:27.467 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these are all
the cards, right, 52 of them?

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: 52 cards.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Now there are 52
cards, 52 weeks.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:84%
If you count up all the pips,
all the numbers in the cards,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:90%
you get 364.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And the remainder
of days is the Joker

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:90%
which I can talk about also.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.945 align:middle line:84%
Bad name for a
very powerful card.

00:12:49.945 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It makes
it sound silly.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:90%
It's hardly indicative.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:90%
There are 13 cards in each suit.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.345 align:middle line:84%
There are 13
lunations, or moons.

00:13:01.345 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, in a sense, it's
an ancient computer.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
it comes from.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Olney Richmond said
it came from Atlantis.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.166 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a
shard of evidence.

00:13:14.166 --> 00:13:14.666 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You know, I'm
very much into science also

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's remained the
same through the ages, right?

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: It's remained
the same through the ages.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:90%
I think it's Chaldean.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it comes
from Mesopotamia.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Some people think China, Korea.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:84%
They appeared in
France in the 1300s,

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
so they arrived
before the gypsies.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And they would have been
burned by people in power

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
if they'd known what they
contain because-- so here is

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.825 align:middle line:90%
a look at creation.

00:13:50.825 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Every soul-- you
know, the Bible says

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:84%
let us make man
according to our image.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:90%
It's plural.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Our image.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It's plural.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:90%
How come it's plural?

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:84%
The first card you see
is an ace of hearts.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:90%
I am love.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:90%
I want love.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The second one is I
want to share my love .

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you share your love,
you can create a third, right?

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the three of hearts
is an expression of love.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:84%
The fourth card is I
build with my love.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:32.980 align:middle line:84%
The fifth card is I create
with my card, I venture out

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:90%
and forage.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:90%
The sixth card, I settle in.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
The seventh card is
I adjust my love.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.530 align:middle line:84%
The eighth is I
build with my love.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:90%
The ninth is universal love.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.270 align:middle line:90%
The 10th is transcendental love.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Then the Jack is
sacrifice for love.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's been
called the Christ card.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:90%
The Queen is I serve with love.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:90%
And the King is I master love.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:90%
And so it runs--

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it all about love?

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.231 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Well, no.

00:15:01.231 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Then it runs into clubs.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So after you have love-- I'm not
going to go through all of it--

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.210 align:middle line:90%
you want to learn.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:90%
You want to acquire knowledge.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:90%
You want to develop your mind.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And after you've done
that, you deal with values.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:90%
You deal with money.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:90%
You deal with materiality.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:90%
You deal with systems.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:90%
You analyze and evaluate things.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And then spades, you go to work.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:90%
And then you come up here.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Up at the top, you see a
Jack, a Queen, and a King.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the atom
is positive, negative,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:90%
and neutral.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:90%
The Jack is neutral.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
The Queen is
negative, bad again.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:90%
The King is positive.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's neutral,
receptive, and active.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And so, in a sense, this
is a sort of God power,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:84%
although a King of
spades is not a god.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:90%
They're unusual people.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Barry Goldwater was
a King of spades.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.612 align:middle line:84%
The head of the FBI
was a original--

00:16:07.612 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Edgar G?

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: The Edgar G
was a King of spades.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.614 align:middle line:90%
So was Betty Ross.

00:16:12.614 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was a
blessing on our nation.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm a King of
diamonds, you said once.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You're a
King of diamonds.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But then something
happened in creation.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:90%
And here we are now.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So while the King of diamonds
is here, now you're over here.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
does that mean?

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.323 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: That means
you have to learn

00:16:33.323 --> 00:16:35.960 align:middle line:84%
those lessons, new
set of lessons.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And you acquire a new soul,
which is a three of clubs.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You can see that the
same position is here.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.567 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
everybody's life spread.

00:16:47.567 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:90%
In a sense, we're all connected.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are more
connected than other people.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.277 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What determines this?

00:16:53.277 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: All right.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:84%
There is a quadration
that you do.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
You go from what I
call the soul spread--

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
it's been called a pure spread--
to the life spread, which

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.520 align:middle line:90%
is called the mundane spread.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And you take the cards, and
you deal three at a time.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.106 align:middle line:84%
And then the last four cards,
you deal one at a time.

00:17:13.106 --> 00:17:14.480 align:middle line:84%
You pick it up in
the same order,

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and then you deal
one card at a time.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It's-- and you're
creating a spiral.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.693 align:middle line:84%
And what this is really
is a double helix.

00:17:22.693 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you're on
the phone doing the radio

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:28.810 align:middle line:84%
show with me, and you're doing
that, you're looking at this?

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, I have
a big one in my office.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's for natal readings.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I handed
out to the audience as well.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
do that every time

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
for year one, year
two, year three.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, it's been done.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we have the little
book of "Seven Thunders"

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.640 align:middle line:90%
that is mentioned--

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is your
life right here, huh?

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.328 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: --that's mentioned.

00:17:55.328 --> 00:17:56.505 align:middle line:90%
So every year has been done.

00:17:56.505 --> 00:18:01.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So every year you
change a position.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And every year you
learn new lessons.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So, in a sense, I
call it the journey

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:84%
of the soul and the journey of
the lessons that we go through.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.928 align:middle line:84%
Now what did you
give the audience?

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:90%
What do they have?

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: They have this chart.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And mostly so
they could follow me.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And also look up their birthday,
or the birthday of someone

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:90%
So let's use some of them.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Anybody
have a question?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know how to read it?

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: No, but they can
look up their birthday,

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
or they can look up
somebody else's birthday,

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.228 align:middle line:90%
and ask about a relationship.

00:18:37.228 --> 00:18:37.949 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:40.365 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: As a psychic, do
you believe in reincarnation?

00:18:40.365 --> 00:18:44.349 align:middle line:84%
And can you tell what someone
was in a previous life?

00:18:44.349 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: No.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't trust any
psychic to tell you that.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:84%
The only way to get a
good past life experience

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:90%
would be with a hypnotist.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A hypnotherapist?

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: That's the only way.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to be
a legitimate one.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I believe in
reincarnation even though I

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:84%
studied a lot of
religions is not

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:90%
from a religious point of view.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe in it because
of psychologists

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:84%
that I heard 30 years ago
who said that they were doing

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis on someone and
unexpectedly found material

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:90%
from a previous life.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And because they'd been
trained scientifically,

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
they researched the clothes
that were mentioned,

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:84%
the streets that they may have
mentioned that they would have

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.097 align:middle line:90%
no knowledge of out of hypnosis.

00:19:34.097 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty dramatic.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.330 align:middle line:90%
How about another question?

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Did we take care
of that for you?

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.319 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: --from my tradition.

00:19:39.319 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
It comes from
psychological tradition.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
somebody else?

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Question for Joseph Jacobs.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.863 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So you can
do personal readings,

00:19:45.863 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
but can you do more
bigger readings, per se,

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.970 align:middle line:84%
as to like where you
can see like economy's

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.919 align:middle line:84%
going, where we're going
as a consciousness.

00:19:52.919 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Only when I do radio.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Only
when you do radio.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But where
are we going, Joseph?

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Where are we headed
because you have

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.225 align:middle line:90%
done readings on the country--

00:20:02.225 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --on events--

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yes.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.664 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and you've
been pretty right

00:20:05.664 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:90%
on on a lot of them.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Scary right on.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Well, yeah.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I
see that this March

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
as being a difficult time
with some losses, and ups,

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and downs, and may have
to do with our government.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:90%
But I see geological things.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And in October I see some heavy
flooding also and heavy weather

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:84%
As far as the United
States is concerned,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I keep an eye on
the United States.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like our
economy's getting better

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.589 align:middle line:90%
until 2017--

00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: --in the cards
which goes right along

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:84%
with what both liberal and
conservative economists were

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:84%
saying four or five years ago
after our economic collapse.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:90%
That it would take 10 years.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's still going
to be a struggle.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.915 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how far we've
come in the last four years

00:21:02.915 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:84%
because it could have
been a lot worse.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joseph, can
we change our destiny?

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, we
have free choice.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.490 align:middle line:84%
You see, when I showed you
the pure spread, the souls,

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.980 align:middle line:84%
there is no positive
and negative, OK?

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:90%
They're pure.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:84%
When we come into
life, we have choice.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And there are positive
and negative tendencies

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
for every birthday in
many different areas

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
just your Sun card.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:84%
You have a Mercury card, a Venus
card, a Mars card, et cetera.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's "The
Book of Seven Thunders,"

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
the seven planets
showering down on us.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With this free choice--

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --if you take
the cards and say George,

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, this,
and that, this-- I

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
can alter that
then, you're saying?

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Absolutely.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, for
instance, and that's

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:53.844 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons
you would want

00:21:53.844 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:84%
to have a reading is you're
having a, let's say--

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.593 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
fine-tuning your life.

00:21:57.593 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: --a
difficult time of it.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I can say well, that'll
change in March.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:84%
In March, what you
might want to focus on

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:90%
is handling your economics.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Or what you may
want to do in April,

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.129 align:middle line:90%
this is how to handle it.

00:22:13.129 --> 00:22:14.670 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking
for a relationship,

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
this is a particularly good
time to find a relationship.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Careful water conditions
during this time.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of things.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, I open up
to the questions and answers.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I prepare for a
reading for about a half

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.630 align:middle line:90%
an hour.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And then after I've
prepared for the reading,

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and I see what all
of the possibilities

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
are and kind of synthesize
them, I go blank.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I start
very methodically--

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and I think what helped
me develop as an intuitive

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and as a psychic is
having this structure.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
exhausting for you?

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, Edgar Casey,
in his trance state,

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:90%
I think it killed the guy.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it wore him down
as he did these readings.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.113 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: It wasn't
when I was starting out.

00:23:01.113 --> 00:23:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I could do eight hours straight.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.249 align:middle line:84%
Now I only do four
readings a day.

00:23:06.249 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feel it?

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And my
cat will come in

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.542 align:middle line:90%
and say it's time to lie down.

00:23:10.542 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The cat knows?

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: The cat knows.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:90%
The cat is my guy.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:90%
You look nervous.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:90%
You look uptight.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.200 align:middle line:90%
You look tired.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:18.931 align:middle line:90%
And I say what?

00:23:18.931 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Come on, don't bother me now.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I just-- OK, I'll lie down.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And then she's happy,
and she lies down.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
rejuvenate yourself.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And I rejuvenate,
and I go on to my next reading.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.181 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smart cat.

00:23:28.181 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Smart cat.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.880 align:middle line:90%
I assume you feed it well.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.847 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: I do.

00:23:32.847 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This system--
and we're going

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
to get into this a
little bit more--

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:84%
you've got people's
birth months.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:90%
And then they pick the day?

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: The day, and that
tells you what card you are,

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.137 align:middle line:84%
and what some of
the lessons are.

00:23:46.137 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And so if--

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And shows
compatibilities also.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.820 align:middle line:84%
As you said, I'm a
King of diamonds.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Right.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.804 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there were
12 King of diamonds--

00:23:53.804 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Right.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would we all
generally be the same?

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You would
have the same lessons.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You know, one of you
might be a corporate leader.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Another one might be
a corporate supporter

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:90%
of other people's leadership.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there
are similarities?

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Yeah,
some are teachers.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
All King of diamonds are
involved in many things.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And over and above
what you do for money,

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
your main interests are health,
and mysticism, and spiritually.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.660 align:middle line:84%
You work for money,
but you also are

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:84%
able to quickly evaluate
the truth of what

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:90%
other people are saying.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you born a King
of diamonds, in my case?

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is what it is?

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: June 4,
King of diamonds.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's based
on your birthday.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.155 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Male, female,
king of diamonds.

00:24:43.155 --> 00:24:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
is what will be

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.172 align:middle line:90%
with me for the rest of my life.

00:24:46.172 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: That's right.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you move every
year to a new position.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You may experience the
life experiences of-- we

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
have two nine of clubs
out there, right,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:84%
because I talked to
you before-- you're

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
over the nine of
clubs this year.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
does that mean?

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:03.928 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: It's
universal knowledge,

00:25:03.928 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
by the way, and
very humanitarian.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the adventure
of knowledge also.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you say humanitarian,

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:90%
it is for this year?

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: For you.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For me?

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: For our audience
members, it's a lifetime.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
mentally concentrate

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
also through going back to
school if it was interrupted.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:84%
But in your case, it's opening
up to universal knowledge.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
You may want to do
more humanitarian work

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:84%
on top of all the things
that you're doing.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:84%
You need to handle new
business opportunities

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.640 align:middle line:90%
closer to your birthday.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't have my glasses,
so I kind of remember.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
There may be other
entertainment opportunities

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that open up for you
before your birthday.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joseph's
been spot on for me

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.814 align:middle line:84%
in all these years,
frighteningly so sometimes.

00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, 15
years ago, I saw you.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:84%
There are cycles within
cycles that are--

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you've been
through my ups, and downs,

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.240 align:middle line:90%
and my ups.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, you
were in a down cycle

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.490 align:middle line:84%
a year or two after we
got to know each other.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't say that.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I said in five years,
you're going to be big time.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It was my way of letting you
know that whatever you're

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
going through, you went
back into the school of life

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.697 align:middle line:84%
to learn about life, and
career, and work all over again.

00:26:30.697 --> 00:26:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Everything.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had
to-- relationships.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Those--
and relationships.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I should
have had a cat.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Right.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:90%
You can't have my cat.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.050 align:middle line:90%
But that was a five-year.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:90%
There are two-year cycles.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.080 align:middle line:84%
There are seven-year
cycles that I read.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
cycles within cycles.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:84%
There's seven cycles
during the year as well.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
people want to know?

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:84%
When they call you, what
are their interests?

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.700 align:middle line:90%
There's always that question.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Joseph, help me with this.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, my strong
points are relationships,

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.092 align:middle line:84%
your purpose in life,
your purpose in life,

00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:08.675 align:middle line:84%
what you're here to
learn, what you're

00:27:08.675 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:84%
here to offer--
relationships and career.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And very often, a
lot of questions

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:20.410 align:middle line:84%
are about work, change of
work, working conditions,

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.470 align:middle line:90%
or relationships.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And relationships aren't just
one-to-one relationships,

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:33.173 align:middle line:84%
but within the family, mother,
daughter problems, children

00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:84%
who aren't relating to
their parents, for instance.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.722 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very good
at relationships.

00:27:39.722 --> 00:27:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are
several ways of doing

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.577 align:middle line:84%
that that are not
obvious in the cards.

00:27:43.577 --> 00:27:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On one of
our previous shows,

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.230 align:middle line:90%
we interviewed a matchmaker.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.030 align:middle line:84%
You two should get
together because

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.659 align:middle line:84%
with your system
and her matching--

00:27:50.659 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: No.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.284 align:middle line:84%
You don't want this
guy with this girl.

00:27:53.284 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, go, leave.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: This is three weeks.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
probably right, spot on.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Are you bullish about
people, in general?

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Absolutely.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:06.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who scares you,
anyone who is out to con you.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's in
an ad on television,

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.934 align:middle line:84%
or is somebody
telling you-- you go

00:28:17.934 --> 00:28:19.350 align:middle line:84%
to a psychic who
tells you there's

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:84%
a curse on you,
that's a con job.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
really be careful.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the early
radio shows that I did,

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
that was almost half my
mission was publicizing myself.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And the other half
was warning people

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:90%
about how they can be taken.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:84%
People have been taken
for thousands of dollars.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.834 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:28:37.834 --> 00:28:39.375 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: These con
artists will tell

00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:41.300 align:middle line:84%
them there's a curse
on their money.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a curse
on their jewelry,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll
never see them again.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.341 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not going
to mention her name,

00:28:46.341 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:84%
but I bounced a
psychic off my show

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.999 align:middle line:84%
after a couple horrible
faux pas on her part.

00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And a great
reputation of that psychic.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She had a
great reputation.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.126 align:middle line:84%
And I had to hold the line on
that and say you know what?

00:29:00.126 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go through this.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.875 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: I was
so glad when that

00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
happened because
she's on television.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:90%
And she'll say oh, this.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And is there an r?

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.735 align:middle line:90%
Is there an m in your name?

00:29:13.735 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let me tell
the audience and everybody

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.977 align:middle line:90%
watching what happened.

00:29:16.977 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to mention
the person by name.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:90%
But it was couple years ago.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And you might remember that case
of the miners who were trapped.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.789 align:middle line:90%
And it was a sad, sad story.

00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was a report.

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the air
doing "Coast to Coast."

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:84%
There was a report that
the miners were alive.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:90%
And I was crying on the air.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:90%
It was that emotional.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these people had been
down there for a couple weeks.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing story.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And I had this well-known
psychic on the air.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said well, so
and so, how about that?

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said well, I knew
that would happen like that.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we went
to a commercial.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, every
wire service said wrong story.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:90%
They're all dead.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.100 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely horrible.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And I just had a psychic
on the air say well,

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I knew they'd be
all found alive.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I had to go to that person
and say you were wrong.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And she said well, I
didn't mean it like that.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.019 align:middle line:90%
And it was at that point--

00:30:27.019 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: There were other
criminal issues there.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.435 align:middle line:90%
And also--

00:30:30.435 --> 00:30:32.509 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that must
really drive you nuts.

00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Oh, yeah.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.579 align:middle line:90%
Get a reasonable price, too.

00:30:34.579 --> 00:30:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Anybody who charges you--

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, did I
do the right thing?

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.873 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bumping them off?

00:30:37.873 --> 00:30:39.499 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Oh, yeah,
for other reasons.

00:30:39.499 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.165 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: --a whole
backlog of other reasons.

00:30:42.165 --> 00:30:44.670 align:middle line:84%
But anybody who charges you
$300 or $400 for a reading

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:90%
is outrageous.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they get a lot of
television promotions

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot, but get
a reasonable price,

00:30:55.490 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:84%
make sure that you get a CD, or
tape, perhaps of the reading.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --of the event.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: I do CD's so that you
can listen to it over and over

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.150 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Ask them-- you
know, first of all,

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:90%
don't go cold to a psychic.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't do
that with a lawyer.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't--

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --a doctor.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.465 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You wouldn't
do that with a doctor.

00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:17.010 align:middle line:84%
When I go to a new
doctor, I find out

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:23.130 align:middle line:84%
what college they went to, where
they interned, and all of that.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So go by good recommendation
and ask the right questions.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:90%
How much do you charge?

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.490 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell me?

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Can I record this, or are
you going to record this?

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who then scares
you, forget about it.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know, I kind of
prepare you rather than

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:46.142 align:middle line:90%
scare you.

00:31:46.142 --> 00:31:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of every 10 psychics,
Joseph, of every 10 psychics

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.550 align:middle line:84%
that are out there,
how many would you say

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.677 align:middle line:90%
are probably legit?

00:31:53.677 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: The kind of
psychics that people usually

00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.765 align:middle line:84%
think of as psychic, there
are maybe a few hundred

00:32:00.765 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:90%
in the whole world.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Legit?

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:06.276 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Well, no, who really--

00:32:06.276 --> 00:32:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They really
know what they're doing?

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: I've worked with one.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.505 align:middle line:90%
I went to Japan with him.

00:32:11.505 --> 00:32:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And we went on the
subway, and suddenly there

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.220 align:middle line:90%
were crowds all around him.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the TV shows they
did about him, news shows

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.630 align:middle line:84%
where he would be driving
through a neighborhood

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:middle line:84%
in Tokyo, and would say
there's a body over there.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there was?

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that kind of
psychic is very rare.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.557 align:middle line:84%
Then there are the autodidacts
who are-- you know,

00:32:36.557 --> 00:32:39.317 align:middle line:84%
a good astrologer or
numerologist is also psychic.

00:32:39.317 --> 00:32:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.316 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You do
this long enough,

00:32:41.316 --> 00:32:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to get
intuition and highlights.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And they may not even
realize that they're

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.366 align:middle line:90%
getting information.

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
an individual.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.810 align:middle line:84%
The more you do something,
the better you get at it.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember a time you
talk about being intuitive.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm driving down the road
coming up to an intersection,

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:90%
and I've got the green light.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, you go through it, right?

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.586 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Right.

00:33:04.586 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something told me
don't go through this light.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I had cars behind
me, and I stopped.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I stopped at a green
light because something

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
told me don't go through
the intersection.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:21.340 align:middle line:84%
At that very moment, a car
comes speeding 60 miles an hour

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.300 align:middle line:90%
through their red light.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.547 align:middle line:84%
And they would have broad-sided
me on the driver's side.

00:33:26.547 --> 00:33:27.880 align:middle line:90%
I probably would have been dead.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Well, you listened.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
something in there,

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:90%
but what was that inside of me?

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: It's the quiet voice.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.544 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
heard the quiet voice,

00:33:35.544 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I was lying-- I
was 39 years old.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And this was all before I
learned about the cards,

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and did psychometry, and had all
these mystical things started

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.120 align:middle line:90%
to happen to me.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.545 align:middle line:84%
And I was lying at a
pool in Santa Monica.

00:33:51.545 --> 00:33:53.285 align:middle line:84%
And I said what
is this all about?

00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:54.369 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:33:54.369 --> 00:33:54.910 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.899 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a quiet
voice say work for life.

00:33:58.899 --> 00:34:00.315 align:middle line:84%
And the New Yorker
in me said what

00:34:00.315 --> 00:34:01.941 align:middle line:84%
do you mean by that,
quietly to myself.

00:34:01.941 --> 00:34:02.981 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:34:02.981 --> 00:34:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Work for life?

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, work for life?

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Work for life?

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Work for life?

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Nothing, nothing.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.620 align:middle line:84%
But little by
little, we're so busy

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.840 align:middle line:84%
on our cell phones, our
computers, our rushing

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.810 align:middle line:84%
around, our worries
that we don't listen.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And I would recommend to listen,
to take those quiet moments.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:84%
You with all of your busy stuff,
to have those quiet moments,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.699 align:middle line:90%
to tune in.

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have that quiet
voice now all the time.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I'll suddenly obsess
about something,

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.379 align:middle line:84%
or get nervous about
something, and we're

00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:41.420 align:middle line:90%
thinking about something.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.574 align:middle line:84%
And then I hear, no, you
don't want to go there.

00:34:43.574 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well--

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You don't
want to do that.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --I'm learning to
listen to those little voices.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.303 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, obviously
you've had that.

00:34:49.303 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's in the Bible.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not easy.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:52.719 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: The still,
quiet voice within.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:54.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me tell you
because sometimes you

00:34:54.635 --> 00:34:56.360 align:middle line:84%
think you're getting
wrong information.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Right.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many times
in our lives have we went

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:90%
would've, should've--

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.901 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you know,
where we do something?

00:35:01.901 --> 00:35:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: I decided on January
1st right after a wild New

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Year's Eve party which
we can't talk about--

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your idea of a
wild New Year's Eve party

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.895 align:middle line:84%
is to put a little
hat on your cat.

00:35:12.895 --> 00:35:13.436 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Oh.

00:35:13.436 --> 00:35:14.576 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, no.

00:35:14.576 --> 00:35:17.320 align:middle line:84%
This was oh, you
know, I was more

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.304 align:middle line:84%
into testosterone in
those days than I--

00:35:19.304 --> 00:35:19.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You?

00:35:19.845 --> 00:35:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: --was
into spirituality.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said this is what I
want to do on January 1, 1982.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed up all night making
charts, and business cards,

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:37.910 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:84%
29 days later, I remember
my parents-- the day

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.935 align:middle line:90%
that they die, I light a candle.

00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And the candle usually lasts 24
hours, sometimes 30, 36 hours.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said Dad, am I
doing the right thing?

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And the candle lasted
exactly 53 hours, 53 cards.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I ran into a
Kabbalistic rabbi that I

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.360 align:middle line:84%
knew who knew the
gematria, which

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.730 align:middle line:84%
is this spiritual numerology
that relates to Hebrew.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.640 align:middle line:90%
And I said to him what is 53?

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said gan--
G-A-N, not G-U-N--

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.730 align:middle line:84%
which means garden,
Garden of Eden.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.694 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: The beginning.

00:36:19.694 --> 00:36:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So I got my message
from my father

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:84%
that it was OK to do this
because there are warnings

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.610 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible about watch out.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:30.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, don't go-- and
so I had some uncertainty.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.976 align:middle line:90%
You could be tricked sometimes.

00:36:32.976 --> 00:36:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've got to
be very careful about that.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah, we're tested.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.756 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: We're tested,
and there are lessons,

00:36:39.756 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:90%
but we have no curriculum.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:84%
We come into this
lifetime and nobody

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.310 align:middle line:84%
says this is what
we're going to learn.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:46.090 align:middle line:84%
You're suppose to learn
this, and this, and this.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
tested with this and this.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So, in a sense, this
is your curriculum.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes
somebody a little better

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.060 align:middle line:90%
psychically than somebody else?

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.727 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: More time, more
quiet time, more study,

00:36:56.727 --> 00:37:01.490 align:middle line:84%
you know, and tuning in,
taking those quiet moments.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Meditation helps, I've
done a lot of meditation.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Now I sort of even
ruminate, you know, go

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.300 align:middle line:84%
around the house and
just sort of turn on.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But meditation is kind of
tuning into the chattering voice

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.212 align:middle line:84%
that we all have about our
money, and our business,

00:37:20.212 --> 00:37:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and our work, and
our relationship,

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:90%
and yada yada yada yada.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin to
quietly begin to tune in.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it, Joseph,
about the humankind that

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:84%
allows it to tap into
this wireless internet

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.224 align:middle line:90%
in the universe?

00:37:35.224 --> 00:37:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, we
all have the ability.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:41.050 align:middle line:84%
We are born into matter
to work our way out of it.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the soul was
born, to work as a human being,

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to live with the
needs of the flesh,

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and to ultimately get to a
higher level of awareness,

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, and charity,
and giving, and creativity,

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and all of the other things,
all the other tools that

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.485 align:middle line:84%
are available to us
to finally work on.

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just want you to
know, Joseph's website is

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:90%
800seeself.com.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.970 align:middle line:90%
You've had that up and running.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.130 align:middle line:84%
His toll free number,
1-800-see-self as well.

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.872 align:middle line:84%
I've got that thing memorized
after all these years.

00:38:20.872 --> 00:38:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You know,
so, in a sense,

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I help you see yourself
and see for yourself

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.860 align:middle line:84%
what you need to work
on, and what to expect,

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.830 align:middle line:90%
and what to handle.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.649 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You truly
care about people.

00:38:31.649 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Oh, yeah.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:90%
What else is there?

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.970 align:middle line:90%
People and animals.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had somebody call you,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.909 align:middle line:84%
and they just break
down emotionally?

00:38:37.909 --> 00:38:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Oh, sure.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sure.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the reasons
I record my readings

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.157 align:middle line:84%
is so that the client
can hear themselves.

00:38:45.157 --> 00:38:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's important.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.698 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Because they can hear
what's going on in my life,

00:38:48.698 --> 00:38:49.530 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had one woman, I
ran into her some months

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:90%
later at a particular event.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said you
know what helped me?

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Because she was struggling about
a relationship, and it was,

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:84%
well, he doesn't relate
to me all of a sudden.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's going.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said I heard
myself, and I realized what

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:90%
a lot of nonsense.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I've just got to
let go of this guy.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.985 align:middle line:90%
That's the best remedy.

00:39:11.985 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take some
questions for Joseph Jacobs.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So if someone
would want to really develop

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:25.610 align:middle line:84%
their own psychic abilities,
what would you have them do?

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:26.986 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great question, Joseph.

00:39:26.986 --> 00:39:30.490 align:middle line:90%


00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: I
mentioned meditation.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.780 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned taking quiet time.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.630 align:middle line:90%


00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:40.120 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
find a teacher.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Some people develop it
through tarot cards.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I have problems
with the tarot cards

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:84%
because we've forgotten
what they're really for.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if they
were meant to be shuffled,

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.660 align:middle line:84%
but a good psychic will
sometimes need that as a focus,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.410 align:middle line:90%
as a focus.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's for the client as well.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:00.285 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I worked with a psychic
who always had a glass of water

00:40:00.285 --> 00:40:00.830 align:middle line:90%
.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And she would read it like
a crystal ball, you know.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Find your medium.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.545 align:middle line:84%
And a lot-- what's
your birthday?

00:40:10.545 --> 00:40:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: January 16th.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: January 16th?

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.430 align:middle line:90%
So you're a Jack of diamonds.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you're a messenger
in this lifetime.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So you may be a messenger
as a writer, as an artist,

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.690 align:middle line:90%
as a helper of other people.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.810 align:middle line:90%
And so study meditation.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes involving yourself
with a spiritual group

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.730 align:middle line:90%
can add to that as well.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Doing yoga, get off
your cell phones.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't
know why people

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.300 align:middle line:84%
have to talk while
they're in a car,

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.810 align:middle line:84%
or why they can't pull
over, or why they can't just

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:53.160 align:middle line:84%
shut down for a moment,
and begin to listen more.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.402 align:middle line:90%
Does that help at all?

00:40:55.402 --> 00:40:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Definitely.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: OK.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.829 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My grandmother
used to read tea leaves--

00:40:59.829 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Oh, yeah.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --in the
inside of a tea cup.

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:05.680 align:middle line:84%
People would drink it, and
the tea leaf would be left.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And whatever the
pattern was, she

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:90%
could determine their future.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.190 align:middle line:90%
And she was pretty uncanny.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: And I do it too.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Whatever-- my cat, when
it's finished eating,

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.480 align:middle line:90%
will leave little pictures.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's a map.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
before I left, it was

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.030 align:middle line:90%
a map that looked like Asia.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And we had that
meteor hit in Asia.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Or she'll leave a smile saying
I like this food, or a frown,

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't like this food,
and you're a pest today.

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, so I mean we get
our messages in many ways.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Tea leaves, absolutely.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.160 align:middle line:90%
There are many things.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.680 align:middle line:84%
When I was going through my
crazy period at the age of 40,

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I would look at a license plate
and get certain impressions

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.220 align:middle line:90%
and ideas.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.980 align:middle line:90%
The messages are all around us.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.675 align:middle line:84%
We may not be available
at the age of 14, 18, 20,

00:41:56.675 --> 00:42:02.370 align:middle line:84%
30 to see those messages,
or to acknowledge them,

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.130 align:middle line:90%
or to get an answer from them.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But as you get older, and as
you are more focused, you do.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And you want to listen to
the quiet voice within.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:14.966 align:middle line:84%
Of course, schizophrenics
hear voices also.

00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: You know?

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:21.780 align:middle line:84%
But theirs is self-destructive
or other destructive;

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.690 align:middle line:84%
whereas the quiet voice
that is helpful to you

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:26.240 align:middle line:90%
and helpful to other people.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.976 align:middle line:90%
And the Bible says that.

00:42:27.976 --> 00:42:32.810 align:middle line:84%
If a seer is telling you
the truth, then they're OK.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.979 align:middle line:90%
And if they're not, they're not.

00:42:34.979 --> 00:42:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take another
question for Joseph Jacobs.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir, right over here.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You were
talking about messages.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering
where do you think

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.150 align:middle line:90%
that the messages come from?

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Is it your inner-self
or somewhere else?

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well,
it sounds like me,

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
quiet, unjudgmental.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And we all have guardian
angels, or some people

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.160 align:middle line:90%
call them guides.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.640 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And they sometimes see us
going through a lot of stuff.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.790 align:middle line:90%
And they don't interfere.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they will,
as was in your case

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.410 align:middle line:90%
when you were driving.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:19.210 align:middle line:90%
So we all have guardian angels.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And there may be angels
here now, or guides.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it can
be an animal also.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a person that you
meet may be a message to you.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Now you may not recognize it.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Very often, someone
after a divorce

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:41.720 align:middle line:84%
will meet someone from the
opposite sex, same sex,

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:46.930 align:middle line:84%
whatever it may be as
somebody to nurture them

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:90%
through that period.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:84%
It may not be a
long-term relationship,

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:52.130 align:middle line:90%
but to nurture them through it.

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:58.177 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you can be a
guardian angel yourself.

00:43:58.177 --> 00:44:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Let's take another
question for Joseph Jacobs.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:01.712 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am?

00:44:01.712 --> 00:44:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Um,
the 10 of diamonds,

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.360 align:middle line:90%
what can you tell me about that?

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: It's
mastery of values.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:12.077 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of your life's
issues, as with most diamonds,

00:44:12.077 --> 00:44:13.160 align:middle line:90%
are going to be financial.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.076 align:middle line:90%
What to do with money?

00:44:14.076 --> 00:44:14.810 align:middle line:90%
How to handle it?

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Where do I get it?

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.280 align:middle line:90%
But you are central.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.280 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
life spread, you

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.980 align:middle line:90%
are central in that life spread.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And your soul card is
the Queen of clubs,

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:33.980 align:middle line:84%
which is the teacher, the one
who serves others, the one who

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:84%
wants to guide and
help people also.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're not just
a 10 of diamonds,

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.730 align:middle line:84%
but what gets in the way
of the 10 of diamonds

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:48.267 align:middle line:84%
very often is,
with all 10s, is I

00:44:48.267 --> 00:44:50.350 align:middle line:84%
want to do what I want to
do when I want to do it,

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:53.730 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't always
lead to success.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.395 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joseph, what happens
if your card doesn't match

00:44:57.395 --> 00:44:59.380 align:middle line:90%
the person you're involved with.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Is there a conflict there?

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: You mean, in
terms of relationships?

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.119 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they not
match up sometimes?

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Oh, yeah.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, supposedly Venus
and Jupiter relationships

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.590 align:middle line:90%
are the best.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And there could be a
Saturn relationship

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.520 align:middle line:84%
where it's student/teacher,
and it's hard work.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.070 align:middle line:84%
There could be
Mercury relationships

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
where people are so
tuned into each other,

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.000 align:middle line:90%
they could be like siblings.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And siblings very often
get annoyed with each other

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:84%
because they see a projection
of their own negativity

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.750 align:middle line:90%
in the other.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.070 align:middle line:84%
The Clintons are a
Mercury relationship.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:47.360 align:middle line:84%
The Nixons were a
Mercury relationship.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And very close,
and they understood

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:53.120 align:middle line:84%
each other, interested in
the same things, and yet,

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.430 align:middle line:84%
they can sort of get
annoyed with each other,

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and have problems
from time to time.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Friction.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:58.645 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yeah.

00:45:58.645 --> 00:45:59.990 align:middle line:90%
There can be knight moves.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is
like a chess board,

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.020 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, the card spreads.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It could be knight
move relationships

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.540 align:middle line:84%
where people are on
again, off again.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.030 align:middle line:84%
It could be relationships
which are very close,

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:13.350 align:middle line:84%
but their schedules
are different.

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Or they could be separated
geographically from time

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:17.530 align:middle line:90%
to time.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And I can see that
in the cards as well.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And that takes a great
deal of maturity.

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And the maturity
depends on their ability

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.590 align:middle line:84%
to communicate when they
finally do get together.

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:29.050 align:middle line:84%
One may be on night
shift, one on day shift.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:32.920 align:middle line:84%
One may be needing
to travel for work.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I encourage
in those relationships

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:84%
is that they sit down-- and
men aren't too good at this.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Women have to teach
them how to ventilate,

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.570 align:middle line:84%
how to talk about where
they're at, and not interrupt,

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and not be interrupted,
and listen.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
one also, communicate.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, relationships
are based on the ability

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.210 align:middle line:90%
to communicate.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:47:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
communication is like this.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there could be
a hot, early relationship,

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.375 align:middle line:90%
and it turns into war.

00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: It turns into war.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And I can see that as well.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You must be
fulfilled with what you do.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: I do, except when
I get exhausted doing it.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.970 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:19.190 align:middle line:90%
It's very helpful.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:23.230 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of very good
feedback about 99% of the time.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, if
somebody doesn't get it,

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:84%
there's something
wrong psychologically.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think if I
were reading someone

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:35.080 align:middle line:84%
with a heavy
psychological problem,

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.520 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to work.

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.050 align:middle line:84%
The more active you are,
the more you are a seeker,

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:47.310 align:middle line:84%
the more you're involved in
life, the truer my reading is.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
come across a situation

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:53.410 align:middle line:90%
where you just felt a block?

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.920 align:middle line:84%
There was something
about that individual,

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.490 align:middle line:90%
and you just couldn't feel it?

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: No, not at all.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I remember once I had
a guy, a muscular guy,

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.050 align:middle line:84%
sit in front of me when
I was seeing clients.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And he started like this.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing the reading,
and he started to slowly,

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:12.800 align:middle line:90%
you know, a bit like this--

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He melted.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: --and open up.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he came up with a guard.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You made
him a believer.

00:48:16.675 --> 00:48:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Well, some people
have guards, you know.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And to some extent in our
modern life, we need that.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you can let your
guard down, drop your mask,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:84%
drop your armor that you
need for the outside world,

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:35.520 align:middle line:84%
or for work, or that you think
you do for those situations.

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.930 align:middle line:90%
And very often we do.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But in an intimate
situation, you

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:46.530 align:middle line:84%
can let your guard
down and open up.

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people, I won't
read as I'm taking

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:52.990 align:middle line:90%
the booking, a small percentage.

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.150 align:middle line:84%
If I find that they're going
to control the reading,

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.740 align:middle line:90%
that they want it their way.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And sometimes
they're very needy.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.286 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can't
help I wanna say and--

00:49:04.286 --> 00:49:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: If they're in
that kind of a state,

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.297 align:middle line:90%
they need to see a therapist--

00:49:09.297 --> 00:49:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --a doctor.

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: --or a
lawyer, or a doctor,

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going to do
the work that they need to do.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:20.490 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to open up
to those perceptions at all.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And, in other words,
they're in a help me.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:25.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm helpless.

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: It's people who
are active in their life,

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:33.150 align:middle line:84%
or having to make important
decisions in their life,

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:37.500 align:middle line:84%
somebody owns a company who
wants me to read the employees,

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:40.500 align:middle line:84%
or when's a good time to
advertise, or to borrow money,

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.550 align:middle line:84%
or those-- so when you're
active in your life,

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:50.150 align:middle line:84%
or if you have relationship
issues, want to change careers,

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:52.910 align:middle line:84%
some people are on the
verge of retirement,

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:56.190 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
do beyond retirement.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I usually suggest
start a business

00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.955 align:middle line:84%
two years before you
go into retirement.

00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:01.580 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be a money business,

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.810 align:middle line:84%
but lay out some plans
of things that you

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.710 align:middle line:84%
want to work on because,
in retirement, you

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.700 align:middle line:84%
could be like a soldier
who comes home and then

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.450 align:middle line:84%
wants to be a couch
potato for six months.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.991 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: See.

00:50:11.991 --> 00:50:14.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's what I mean that
you're also a consultant.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.840 align:middle line:90%
You're a counselor to people.

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Well, yeah.

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:18.348 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you give
them advice, good advice.

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: But it's based
very much on the cards.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And speaking of
cards, why don't we do that.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Look at your birth
date, and tell

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Joseph what your card
number is, and just

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.530 align:middle line:84%
show your hands
when you're ready.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.094 align:middle line:90%
And we'll just hand you the mic.

00:50:32.094 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Pick somebody out.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.218 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we'll just
go right down the line.

00:50:35.218 --> 00:50:36.220 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Queen of diamonds.

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's a
Queen of diamonds.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.151 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: More of a
leader than a follower.

00:50:41.151 --> 00:50:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Also a Queen energy usually
wants to be of service.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:90%
You want to help people.

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:50.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can
rush into situations

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:53.340 align:middle line:84%
where an angel
would fear to tread.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of changes
in your early life,

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:59.790 align:middle line:84%
a lot of shifts and changes in
the first 12 years of your life

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:90%
has left you kind of restless.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.870 align:middle line:90%
What sign are you?

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A Libra.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: You're a Libra?

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.208 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:06.208 --> 00:51:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And so
a great curiosity

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:13.530 align:middle line:84%
about knowledge and about
learning about a lot of things.

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.535 align:middle line:84%
Worry is probably
your biggest problem,

00:51:15.535 --> 00:51:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and how you make
decisions, and how

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:21.275 align:middle line:84%
you pick and choose even
the people in your life.

00:51:21.275 --> 00:51:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's just pass the
microphone all the way across.

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: These
are just nutshells.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:27.734 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Six of diamonds.

00:51:27.734 --> 00:51:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Sixes.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.460 align:middle line:90%
All sixes are messengers.

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're a six of
diamonds, six of clubs,

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:35.190 align:middle line:84%
they're messengers
to each other.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And the message can be
in any number of ways.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And so great communicator,
very verbal, very humanitarian.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Your soul's is
the nine of clubs,

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.150 align:middle line:90%
which is universal knowledge.

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And there may have been
an interrupted education

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:53.150 align:middle line:84%
in your early years, but
you're a perennial student.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And many job changes,
or also many directions

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.930 align:middle line:90%
in the work that you do.

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:03.192 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a question?

00:52:03.192 --> 00:52:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh, no, no.

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.830 align:middle line:90%
No particular question.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How accurate was he?

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was very
accurate, absolutely.

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Now that's
just a little bitty--

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, you
were spot on, absolutely.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pass us down.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Jack of diamonds.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.720 align:middle line:90%
May 8th is my birthday.

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: OK, we have two Jack
of diamonds like bookends here.

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:21.507 align:middle line:90%
When is it?

00:52:21.507 --> 00:52:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: May 8th.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: May 8th?

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.170 align:middle line:90%
America is a jack of diamonds.

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And the jack of diamonds is the
poet, the writer, the artist,

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:35.630 align:middle line:84%
the sales person,
the communicator.

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Jacks, sixes, and aces are
messengers in many ways.

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:41.890 align:middle line:84%
A youthful energy,
and there may often

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:45.570 align:middle line:84%
be a conflict between the
career that you really

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:47.680 align:middle line:90%
want to feel comfortable in.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And there may be more than
one possibility in that.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.787 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The eight of hearts.

00:52:53.787 --> 00:52:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: The eight of
hearts is the power of love

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:59.120 align:middle line:90%
and the power of creativity.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Eights have a lot of power.

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:02.190 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
eights sideways, it

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:05.300 align:middle line:84%
looks like infinity, the
ability to spiral outward,

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.810 align:middle line:90%
or to contract in.

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Often, there's a problem
with addiction or compulsion.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, and what I
usually tell an eight,

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.950 align:middle line:84%
or someone who has a card
that indicates addiction

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:21.541 align:middle line:84%
or compulsion, I
say make a fist.

00:53:21.541 --> 00:53:22.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Make a fist.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Now open up.

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:25.830 align:middle line:90%
What happens when you open up?

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:29.080 align:middle line:84%
You open yourself up
to receiving more.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But the eight is
wonderful with the public,

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:35.670 align:middle line:84%
wonderful in
communication areas,

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.560 align:middle line:84%
can be very artistic,
very creative.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:90%


00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:45.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of passion here
and a lot of possibilities

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:46.679 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:53:46.679 --> 00:53:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:48.750 align:middle line:90%
We've got time for a few more.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep going.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
the five of diamonds.

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Five of diamonds?

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.790 align:middle line:84%
The motto of the
five of diamonds

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:57.450 align:middle line:90%
is freedom at any cost.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they picked
themselves a mother

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:03.460 align:middle line:84%
that was pretty
tough to discipline.

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:07.670 align:middle line:84%
It also means
creative financing,

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and restlessness
that needs channeling

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:11.760 align:middle line:90%
into a creative outlet.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.950 align:middle line:90%
What sign?

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm a Libra.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: A Libra?

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.446 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another Libra,
they're everywhere.

00:54:16.446 --> 00:54:17.654 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We're everywhere.

00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: So very
service-oriented,

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:21.480 align:middle line:84%
anything having to
do with education

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.750 align:middle line:90%
and the arts is important.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And finally when you
commit, you commit.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:30.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And health concerns
with others very often

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.332 align:middle line:84%
in your lifetime and many
other things as well.

00:54:37.332 --> 00:54:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: If I can
ask something also--

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:39.665 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Sure.

00:54:39.665 --> 00:54:43.094 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You-- that
is my life number, right?

00:54:43.094 --> 00:54:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Right.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And so then you
do yearly assessments also?

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.498 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: That's right.

00:54:47.498 --> 00:54:53.595 align:middle line:84%
The five of diamonds then moves
at age one, age two, et cetera.

00:54:53.595 --> 00:54:58.130 align:middle line:84%
At age 45, you come
to the same place.

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So what people call midlife
crisis, age 44 and age 45,

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.040 align:middle line:84%
is usually, this
is who I really am.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.490 align:middle line:84%
This is really
what I want to do.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:middle line:84%
This is where I want to be, not
to please my parents, society,

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.630 align:middle line:90%
my significant other.

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:16.394 align:middle line:84%
I want to be me at age
44 and age 45, or that.

00:55:16.394 --> 00:55:18.060 align:middle line:84%
You know what's
interesting, by the way,

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.600 align:middle line:84%
about today-- I
didn't pick today.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I didn't
even want to do this.

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:24.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to
do public things.

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.680 align:middle line:84%
But, George, I'll
do anything for.

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.712 align:middle line:84%
But today's an eight
of diamonds day.

00:55:29.712 --> 00:55:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And the eight of diamonds, one
of the meanings of the eight

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:36.560 align:middle line:84%
of diamonds is the keeper
of the goods of the dead.

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.480 align:middle line:90%
That sounds kind of awesome.

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So the eight of diamonds day is
a good day to work on a will,

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:47.230 align:middle line:84%
but it means the keeper
of the-- or antiques.

00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:49.780 align:middle line:84%
You may want to work
with old people.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But also we're talking
about ancient stuff.

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's the keeper of the
goods of the day on this day.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: There are
no coincidences.

00:55:59.140 --> 00:55:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: None.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: But there are some.

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:01.435 align:middle line:90%
No, don't say none.

00:56:01.435 --> 00:56:02.836 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
of wiggle room.

00:56:02.836 --> 00:56:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.365 align:middle line:90%
The ace of diamonds.

00:56:04.365 --> 00:56:07.060 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell me
about the ace of diamonds?

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.935 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: The ace of
diamonds is Mars to you.

00:56:08.935 --> 00:56:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So the ace of diamonds has
the leadership qualities.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.920 align:middle line:90%
They could be real tough.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Also aces, as I said, are
messengers, communicators,

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.690 align:middle line:90%
they have leadership qualities.

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And they can be tough on the
outside, but very easily hurt

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:27.100 align:middle line:90%
emotionally on the inside.

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And a Mars relationship
is you can work with them

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:35.710 align:middle line:90%
or there can be wars.

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:39.728 align:middle line:84%
So it's how you
work things out. .

00:56:39.728 --> 00:56:41.334 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:41.334 --> 00:56:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joseph, we're going
to wrap things up here pretty

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:44.667 align:middle line:90%
soon, but for people--

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:46.124 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: I'm just
getting started.

00:56:46.124 --> 00:56:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --who want more
information from you.

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.733 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Yes?

00:56:48.733 --> 00:56:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Website?

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Website is the
same as my 800 number.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It's 1-800-see-self, S-E-E,
S-E-L-F, as see yourself,

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:57.720 align:middle line:90%
seeforyourself.com.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can always
Google you, too, if we have to,

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Joseph Jacobs.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Although some people
have said Joseph Jacobs,

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.950 align:middle line:90%
scary readings.

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:07.104 align:middle line:84%
I know somebody's
using my name to--

00:57:07.104 --> 00:57:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happens.

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: I get that.

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I guess so.

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
some people out there.

00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:11.805 align:middle line:84%
Are you on the new
social networking?

00:57:11.805 --> 00:57:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Not at all.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Facebook or
anything like that?

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: No, no.

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:16.320 align:middle line:90%
This is not what I ate today.

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:18.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't need that
kind of communication.

00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:21.939 align:middle line:84%
I'm an old fashioned
guy with a take.

00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:22.855 align:middle line:90%
Get me on a telephone.

00:57:22.855 --> 00:57:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather talk to you
than type a message to you.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember you
gave me a book once.

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It may have been the biggest
book I've ever seen in my life.

00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:32.296 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBS: Right.

00:57:32.296 --> 00:57:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was that big, huge.

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Written
by Manly Hall who

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:38.650 align:middle line:84%
was one of the great, great
metaphysicians-- that's

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:41.320 align:middle line:84%
a classic book-- one of
the great metaphysicians.

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was fortunate enough
to sit even closer to him

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:48.200 align:middle line:84%
than this when a
group of psychics

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.079 align:middle line:84%
honored him for lifetime
work just before he died.

00:57:51.079 --> 00:57:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: And he
knew everything.

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.050 align:middle line:90%
This man knew everything.

00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:56.091 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:57:56.091 --> 00:57:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, Joseph, you're
one of a kind.

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:00.450 align:middle line:90%
You're very perceptive.

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:05.860 align:middle line:84%
In 20 seconds or less, what kind
of a year are we going to have?

00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: I think
it's a year of working

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.880 align:middle line:90%
on relationships, on love.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.340 align:middle line:90%
It could be a very karmic year.

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So be careful what you put out
there doesn't come back to you.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:20.240 align:middle line:84%
A year to work on relationships,
and love, and harmony.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.910 align:middle line:90%
We do have some rough months.

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:24.610 align:middle line:84%
March is going to be one,
October is going to be one,

00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and December are going to
be rough months this year.

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we can
change our destiny.

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBS: Absolutely by
being more of who you are,

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and working on yourself,
and by helping other people.

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:46.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have helped myself
by helping other people.

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:47.320 align:middle line:90%
I have grown.

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I've learned from
my clients, not

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.870 align:middle line:84%
from the books that were
written about the cards,

00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:53.036 align:middle line:90%
but from the feedback.

00:58:53.036 --> 00:58:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
I say to a client

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:58.290 align:middle line:84%
after I read them is
what you do for a living?

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Because that's one of my areas,
and it usually checks out,

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:05.580 align:middle line:84%
either numeralogically
or in the cards.

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.062 align:middle line:84%

I've dealt with a
lot of psychics.

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.980 align:middle line:90%
This guy's one of a kind.

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:21.900 align:middle line:84%
