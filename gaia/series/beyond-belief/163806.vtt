>>GEORGE NOORY: Since
the beginning of mankind,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle line:10%
humans have been fascinated
with the planet Mars, but why?

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Do we have some kind of
relationship with Mars?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.310 align:middle line:84%
It's also fascinated plasma
physicist Dr. John Brandenburg

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
to the point that he has
devoted most of his career

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
to investigating Mars
and what may have

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:90%
happened a very long time ago.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:84%
John, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN BRANDENBURG: It's a
great honor to be here, George.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.615 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did
a plasma physicist

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
get involved with studying
Mars and whether it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:90%
had origins of life?

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:10%
>>BRANDENBURG: Well, the time
I grew up in was the time

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.630 align:middle line:10%
of the Space Age, and I grew
up in Medford, Oregon also--

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:10%
just to the north
on the West Coast.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of military
activity during the Cold War,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of kept you
on edge all the time.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:84%
There was constantly
strange stuff in the sky--

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.710 align:middle line:90%
who knows what it was.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And the military would
never explain it.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:10%
>>BRANDENBURG: And so
it kind of gave you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:10%
a feeling of enhanced
reality growing up there.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:10%
I became a very
serious scientist

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:10%
because I was working on plasma
physics for nuclear fusion

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:10%
to try and make a better, warmer
future for the human race.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But part of that was to
do laser fusion, which

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.400 align:middle line:84%
is a miniature
hydrogen bomb, so I

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:84%
had to become educated in
nuclear weapon physics.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.099 align:middle line:84%
I went to graduate school to
get my PhD in Livermore Lab.

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:50.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great school.

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Great school.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great
laboratory system.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Great laboratory.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
extension of UC Davis.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:90%
But I was there on the campus--

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
was a nuclear weapons
lab, where they did

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:90%
also nuclear fusion research.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of
exposed to both worlds--

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
the peaceful uses
of nuclear power

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and then, because of my
laser fusion background,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapon physics.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was there when the
neutron bomb was invented.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
invented it were just down

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:90%
the hall from me.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So with this
experience and the possibilities

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear power, you then
started looking at the planets,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And Mars?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Well, part
of what happened was I

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.670 align:middle line:84%
had to shift from
peaceful nuclear power

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:90%
to working on death ray.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:90%
We were working on--

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.913 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a Tesla death ray?

00:02:41.913 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Like
a Tesla death ray.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I ended up taking a
job in Sandia Labs

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:84%
in Albuquerque, New Mexico
working on charged particle

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:90%
beam weapons.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:10%
And those were to
shoot down missiles,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:10%
but the Army also wanted to use
it as an anti-personnel weapon.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So I've gone from working
on peaceful nuclear power--

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
a brighter, warmer
future for humanity to--

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weaponry.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Weaponry.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.322 align:middle line:90%
And it was a big shift.

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:10.865 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you like that?

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Part of me did.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very patriotic
sort of fellow.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
But part of me was
just horrified by this.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
possibilities, right?

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.451 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: And
the possibilities.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Also, the Cold War was such a
overpowering presence there.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.297 align:middle line:84%
And while I was there, suddenly,
nuclear winter happened.

00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what is that?

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.755 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG:
The nuclear winter

00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:35.820 align:middle line:84%
was inspired by a dust
storm on Mars that covered

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:90%
the entire planet in 1971.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On Mars?

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: On Mars-- from
pole to pole and persisted

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.430 align:middle line:84%
for four months during
the Mariner 9 mission.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Sagan and his
associates kept wondering,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:84%
how is it possible
to have a storm

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.362 align:middle line:84%
cover an entire planet
from pole to pole--

00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would agree.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: --and last?

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they found
out the grim truth--

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
that you could get a storm that
was circulating vertically,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and the same thing
could happen on Earth

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:90%
if there was a nuclear war.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When would
this storm occur?

00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:09.755 align:middle line:90%
After--

00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It would occur
after the nuclear war had

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.145 align:middle line:10%
It would create so much
dust in the atmosphere.

00:04:15.145 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weeks?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Months?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Months.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Months.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And so more people would
die of cold and starvation

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.529 align:middle line:84%
after the nuclear
impact than during it.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying we're
seeing these things happening

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.004 align:middle line:90%
on Mars now?

00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: That's right.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And Mars then became heavily
involved in the Cold War.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the Cold War was going
very unstable at the time.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.726 align:middle line:90%
We had an exercise--

00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:84%
a NATO exercise
called Abel Archer

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that brought us as
close to nuclear war

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.530 align:middle line:84%
as during the Cuban
Missile Crisis,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and it happened
that same time when

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:90%
the nuclear winter came out.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And it filled me with such
a feeling of unease and--

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remorse?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: --that I
never felt at Livermore.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd never felt that way I
was kind of insulated there.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it depression?

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:06.827 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: No, it
was more intense anxiety.

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of something impending?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Well, that we
were in a Mexican standoff

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:90%
with the Russians.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And all it would
take was one mistake,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and we would end up
in a nuclear war.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think this
mistake happened on Mars?

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: That's when
things got interesting.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Because as I was
contemplating all of this--

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here?

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: --here on Earth,
I became aware of the work

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.260 align:middle line:84%
of DiPietro and Molenaar finding
a phase and also a pyramid--

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
nearby pyramid on Mars
at Cydonia Mensae.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And my heart leaped because
I thought, oh my goodness.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
If we can find a dead
civilization on Mars,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:84%
this will change the
conversation on Earth.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
We can break out of this
kind of Cold War mindset.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:84%
We can do a joint mission
with the Russians to Mars.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The Cold War could end, and
intense nuclear standoff

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:90%
could end peacefully.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As opposed to what
might have happened there?

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Right.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was then
investigating Mars,

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and I was reading
up a Mars article--

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:84%
in those days you had
to Xerox everything.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm standing in the
library at Sandia Labs, which

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
was a wonderful place, by
the way-- full of really

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:90%
wonderful professional people.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing in line to use
the Xerox machine to get

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:90%
a scientific article on Mars.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:90%
It was about Mars's atmosphere.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:10%
And Mars's atmosphere is loaded
with a peculiar isotope called

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:10%
xenon-129, and I said--

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:10%
I commented, it made it
different than any other place

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:10%
in the solar systems--

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.620 align:middle line:10%
very different from Earth,
the solar wind, the moon,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:10%
the meteorites-- all are
very different from Mars

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.934 align:middle line:10%
in terms of isotopes of xenon.

00:06:55.934 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned this to this
fellow I was standing next to

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.390 align:middle line:84%
in line, and he said,
let me see that.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at it.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And he had this amazed look
on his face, and he said,

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.671 align:middle line:90%
someone nuked them.

00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa, just like that?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Just like that.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me, and
he said it a second time--

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:90%
that means someone nuked them.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
was dead serious?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.218 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: He
was dead serious.

00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, since we were an
unclassified part of the lab,

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:90%
it was just the library--

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.960 align:middle line:84%
he suddenly said, pardon
me, and he excused himself.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And what that meant is that
he had spoken out of school.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.795 align:middle line:84%
He had spoken about
something classified

00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
in an unclassified
area, and it was--

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then he
realized what he did.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes, and
he realized what he did.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:84%
But I saw his immediate
unguarded reaction to this.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, there
was a part of the lab

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that did atmospheric
monitoring of Earth.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.505 align:middle line:84%
Now John, Gaia has a
program called Deep Space.

00:07:50.505 --> 00:07:51.305 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I want to
take a look at that--

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --because it has
a lot to do with this.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient planet
between Jupiter and Mars,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
is it possible a species
inhabited this missing planet

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:84%
thousands or even
millions of years ago?

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.180 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, could it be they
escaped before its destruction,

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
only to land and
inhabit our Earth?

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:90%

John Brandenburg's work
opens the question,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:10%
what happened 300,000 or a
million years ago on Mars--

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:10%
that he claims the
evidence is hard

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:10%
that there were two
hydrogen bomb explosions?

[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very, very
possible, isn't it?

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
The nuclear weapons experts
I have shown this to just

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:90%
say, yes, you've got it right.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But they said, don't
quote me in public.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
blow themselves up

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.982 align:middle line:84%
from within the planet, or
did this come down from above?

00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: The best working
hypothesis is that Mars was

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
like Earth and
developed an indigenous,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:90%
humanoid species like us--

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.977 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: --that evolved
to a primitive civilization.

00:09:13.977 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Primitive civilization?

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It
looks primitive.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't see any roads,
airports, anything like that.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even the face in
Sidonia looks Egyptian.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It was
Egyptian, or Aztec--

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Olmec-- the people who
carved big heads and helmets

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:90%
were the Olmecs on Earth.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:90%
They were also very mysterious.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Nobody even knows
where they came from.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But it appears that there was a
primitive civilization on Mars,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and then somebody
attacked them from space

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
because the explosions
were airbursts

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.495 align:middle line:90%
of two massive nuclear weapons.

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:50.437 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big would they be?

00:09:50.437 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:90%
What would they look like?

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh,
they would have looked

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:90%
like the Empire State Building.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That big?

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge?

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Huge.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:84%
They would have been
easily constructible

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
in the asteroid belt from the
materials in the asteroid belt,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
then brought to Mars
and dropped on Mars.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would anyone
want to destroy what

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.195 align:middle line:90%
was on the planet at the time?

00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: I don't know.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.295 align:middle line:84%
All I know is there's precedent
on Earth for people wiping out

00:10:16.295 --> 00:10:17.095 align:middle line:90%
other people.

00:10:17.095 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well but
that's warring.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So are we are we sure that maybe
there wasn't a war on Mars?

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It looks
as though the Martians--

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:90%
it may be the face on Mars.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:90%
In fact, Carlotto's--

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Mark Carlotto's
versions of the face

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
on Mars-- it looks quite
threatening and looks

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
like it's burying its teeth
at somebody in outer space.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be
that the people on Mars

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.007 align:middle line:84%
had a beef with
somebody in outer space.

00:10:46.007 --> 00:10:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
ticked somebody off.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And somebody got
annoyed with them--

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:90%
who knows?

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe people from outer space
were abducting their people

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and mutilating their
cattle, who knows?

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG:
And in any case, I

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:84%
believe if we go up there
and land and investigate,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:84%
we will find out possibly
who the other people were,

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.810 align:middle line:84%
because the Martians themselves
would have recorded it.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to
be remnants on Mars--

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.366 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --of
something past, right?

00:11:15.366 --> 00:11:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Right.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
There are two lines now of
intelligent activity on Mars.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:84%
One is what looks like
eroded archeology,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:84%
dating from a Earth-like
period on Mars.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
We found remnants of
this at Cydonia Mensae--

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:90%
the face and the pyramid--

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:84%
the D&M Pyramid--
also in another place

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
called Galaxias Chaos,
which I myself discovered.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And there, apparently, are
two faces there, one of which

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.365 align:middle line:84%
looks just like the face at
Cydonia, except it's smaller.

00:11:44.365 --> 00:11:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If this happened, John,
when do you think it occurred?

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>>BRANDENBURG: It looks like it
dates from the time when Mars

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:10%
had an ocean and was Earthlike.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Billions of years ago?

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.951 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: No,
probably about a quarter

00:11:55.951 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:90%
of a billion years ago.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is nothing
in the scheme of time.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Geologic
time, quite recently.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned,
there are two lines

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:84%
of evidence for
intelligent activity.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:84%
One is the
archaeological remnants--

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
what appear to be
archaeological remnants.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
The other one is the evidence
for a massive nuclear explosion

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.206 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
put your career

00:12:17.206 --> 00:12:18.331 align:middle line:90%
on the line on this theory?

00:12:18.331 --> 00:12:19.247 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: I have.

00:12:19.247 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you have?

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.938 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: I mean,
it's a hypothesis.

00:12:21.938 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a theory.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
People ask me, do
you really know this?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.275 align:middle line:90%
And I say, of course not.

00:12:28.275 --> 00:12:29.075 align:middle line:90%
But the evidence--

00:12:29.075 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the evidence
shows that something happened.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: The
evidence supports this,

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and no one has officially
contradicted me.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I've been waiting.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some critics,
I've challenged them

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to debates on
various talk shows.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, I don't
want to debate Brandenburg.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
win; that's why.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG:
Well, that's right.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, my
conclusion, in fact,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
is that the government
wanted this to come out.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:10%
In fact--

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.369 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Our government?

00:13:01.369 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:10%
>>BRANDENBURG: Our government
has known since 1976 that this

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:10%
occurred and has decided that
it is time for it to come out,

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:10%
because--

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.809 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why not just
publicly come out with it?

00:13:11.809 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:10%
Why not have the news
conference with NASA scientists?

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And they say, we believe
Mars was inhabited

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and that it underwent
some kind of catastrophe.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
We believe the
catastrophe was nuclear.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Here's Dr. John Brandenburg
to tell us more.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they do it like that?

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.728 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: I do
not have any insight.

00:13:30.728 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:10%
All I know is that Dana
Rohrabacher, a congressman

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:10%
from California,
was asking questions

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:10%
to visiting NASA scientists
in a congressional hearing

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:10%

a dead civilization,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:10%
or is there a dead
civilization on Mars

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:10%
that you haven't told us about?

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And they all looked
at each other

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.434 align:middle line:84%
like, we don't know
what to say, and--

00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
knew the answer.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.724 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: They knew
the answer, and he--

00:13:53.724 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:84%
so apparently, this is now
circulating in Washington,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:84%
D.C. And Mike Pence
said that we're

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:84%
going to have American
boots on the face of Mars.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And the face of Mars
is the NASA logo term

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:90%
for the face at Cydonia.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
conceivable-- and I

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:84%
have to ask you
directly-- may you

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:84%
be part of the
government's program

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:90%
to leak this information to us?

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: I apparently am--

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.320 align:middle line:84%
an unwitting,
clueless part of it--

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:90%
I will say that.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:84%
All I'm saying is
that we informed

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
the Defense Intelligence
Agency, Vince DiPietro and I--

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:90%
when we found this evidence.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And after six months, they got
back to us through channels

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and said, why don't
you publish it?

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.476 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they basically
endorsed your work?

00:14:43.476 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Right.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:90%
They basically--

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: John, that's huge.

00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: --in
a very unofficial,

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:90%
kind of back-channel way--

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
saying, let's let him do it.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to do it.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:90%
And just let it--

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.965 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Right.

00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:59.352 align:middle line:84%
In a very deniable fashion,
they basically turned me loose--

00:14:59.352 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of
hands-off on their part.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:01.715 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:02.515 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that this
has now become common currency

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
among the really cognoscenti
in Washington, DC--

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:84%
that there was a dead
civilization or at least

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:84%
there's that
possibility, and that it

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:84%
was wiped out by a
nuclear holocaust

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:90%
of undetermined origin.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would
everyone on that planet

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.605 align:middle line:84%
have been extinguished
instantly?

00:15:21.605 --> 00:15:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.383 align:middle line:84%
It would have destroyed
the planetary environment.

00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:26.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Men, women,
children, animals, trees?

00:15:26.565 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Everything.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Someone destroyed Mars
in a way that they never

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.675 align:middle line:90%
wanted it to recover.

00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
geographically situated the--

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: To the-- yes.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
The two regions of residual
radioactivity on Mars,

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
which are very
weak but still are

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
easily detectable in
thorium and potassium,

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
are correlated with Cydonia
Mensae and Galaxias Chaos--

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:84%
this other center
of civilization.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would there still be
huge radiation levels on Mars

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.001 align:middle line:84%
if we went there
and tested for that?

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: There
certainly would

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:84%
be levels of radiation
in these areas

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:84%
that would be easy to
detect for human beings.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it would be any--

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
that this would present
any hazard for humans

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.590 align:middle line:84%
unless maybe they dug
down below the soil deeply

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:90%
in the centers of these areas--

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ah, this is frightening
because it could happen here.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.986 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh,
it could happen here.

00:16:23.986 --> 00:16:27.050 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
I've published this now

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:84%
was because I sense
a growing nature--

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
growing danger of nuclear
war between us and China.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or Korea.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Or Korea.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want that to happen.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.275 align:middle line:84%
I don't want this planet to
end up looking like Mars.

00:16:41.275 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are there
still nuclear firestorms

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:90%
and these storms on Mars?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:90%
All these years later.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:10%
>>BRANDENBURG: Mars is
in an interesting place

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:10%
in the solar system.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It's right next to the
asteroid belt. In fact, it

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
defines the inner edge
of the asteroid belt.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:84%
The asteroid belt is kind
of constantly expanding

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:90%
because Jupiter stirs it up.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And then Mars kind of intercepts
some of those asteroids

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:90%
before they can go hit Earth.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.904 align:middle line:84%
So Mars is in a very
bad neighborhood.

00:17:12.904 --> 00:17:14.531 align:middle line:90%
It gets frequent impact.

00:17:14.531 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For us, it
was in the right spot.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: For us,
it's in the right spot.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:84%
Mars's grief was our
good times, because Mars

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
absorbed a lot of asteroids
that could have hit the Earth.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing wrong
with being the third rock

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:90%
from the sun, is there?

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.075 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: There's
nothing wrong with it.

00:17:32.075 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And still there are mass
extinctions on Earth,

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.975 align:middle line:84%
one of which corresponds
to roughly the same time

00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
frame as this occurrence on Mars
that's called the Great Permian

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Extinction.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, Death on
Mars, I urge scientists

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that if they see any
isotopic anomalies associated

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
with the Great
Permian Extinction--

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
whose cause is
unknown by the way--

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:84%
wiped out 90% of life on
Earth, even in the oceans,

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and occurred about the same time
as this thing on Mars happened.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:84%

the brain of our national

I began having
nuclear war nightmares

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
like I'd had when I was young,
where I would be standing next

to my children and watching
the whole world being

And part of my way
of getting over that

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:84%
was to write the book Death on

take over the planet.

of Mars as kind of--

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.420 align:middle line:90%
when I first encountered this--

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.350 align:middle line:84%
as like the planet
Alderaan in Star Wars

destroyed because it

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:90%
served as a good example.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.895 align:middle line:84%
It was destroyed to terrorize
the surrounding people.

00:20:39.895 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.120 align:middle line:84%
We've had many things like
that happen in human history.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
The Mongols created
pyramids of skulls.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:90%
If a city resisted them--

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vlad the
Impaler put heads--

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh, absolutely.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --coming up
into the city so people

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:84%
who would see that knew
how horrible he was,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:90%
and they backed off!

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: The Turks--
the whole Turkish army

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
turned around and went home
after encountering this forest

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:90%
of impaled bodies and heads.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any leader who
puts heads on spears lining

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:90%
the road--

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
we don't want anything
to do with him.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: So there is
precedence on a much smaller

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.620 align:middle line:90%
scale in human history.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's add something
to your equation of Mars--

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that maybe they didn't have the
Egyptian kind of civilization,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.997 align:middle line:84%
but maybe they were
high tech themselves.

00:21:30.997 --> 00:21:31.955 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Perhaps.

00:21:31.955 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe they had nukes.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was some kind
of war between the Martians.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It's
eminently possible.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.320 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to determine
the level of a civilization

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:90%
from pictures from outer space.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And some of the Rover
pictures by the way--

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
one of them appears to depict
some kind of like clockwork--

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:90%
like the Antikythera computer--

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:90%
only this is on Mars.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.530 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of artifacts.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.113 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: There's
a lot of things

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:84%
they're encountering that look
like they could be remnants

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:84%
of a civilization--
perhaps blown there

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.347 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps indigenous
to that area.

00:22:12.347 --> 00:22:13.305 align:middle line:90%
It was on the seashore.

00:22:13.305 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robot heads
and stuff like that.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Exactly.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what the level
of civilization there was.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:90%
I say we have to go up there.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to send
people who can dig.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Any archeologist who's worth
his salt will tell you,

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to dig for
a good archeology.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always said,
we won't know until we go.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.785 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: No.

00:22:36.785 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's the thing.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: You
can send robot rovers

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and have them drive around
Cydonia Mensae for a year,

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.074 align:middle line:84%
especially if the people
in charge are in charge,

00:22:48.074 --> 00:22:49.115 align:middle line:90%
they won't find anything.

00:22:49.115 --> 00:22:51.156 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
we're going to get to Mars?

00:22:51.156 --> 00:22:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I believe that, as I
said-- in a clueless way,

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm fitting into somebody's
scheme to get to Mars,

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:90%
and they have to justify--

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:84%
flying to Mars ain't
like flying to the moon.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: You can't wear
diapers all the way there.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a mission.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: It's a mission.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a one-way trip?

00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: I think the
initial parties should count

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:84%
on staying on Mars
for like five years--

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: --simply
because getting back from Mars

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
is a lot more dangerous
than landing there.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the problem.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.171 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Landing there,
you need basically a heat

00:23:28.171 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:90%
shield and a big parachute--

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:90%
maybe some retro rockets.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%
You can land on
Mars very easily.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:84%
It's coming back, erecting a big
rocket on the surface of Mars--

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
that is the really
dangerous part.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So I would urge the original--
the initial expedition

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to basically just camp
out there for five years.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Also, we should land on
Phobos and convert it

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.350 align:middle line:84%
into a space station to
give psychological support

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:90%
to the people on the ground.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here's this big space
station full of groceries.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.005 align:middle line:90%
They've got an infirmary.

00:24:03.005 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:84%
You can be there
in a couple hours

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
using maybe an emergency
kind of lifter.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And just going back
to Phobos is a--

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that's a fairly
easy thing to manage

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
compared to coming back to
Earth from the surface of Mars.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you put up
a space station near Mars

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:90%
you could live on?

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh, yes.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
the reason I mentioned
Phobos is because it's

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:90%
psychologically very important.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Once this comes out and is
widely discussed, as it is now,

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes official,
there will one day

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:84%
be an official
announcement, I believe--

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.045 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: --from NASA
and the Defense Department

00:24:41.045 --> 00:24:43.230 align:middle line:84%
that yes, we're looking
at the possibility

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:84%
of a dead civilization
that was wiped out

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:90%
by a nuclear holocaust.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a dramatic story--

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Once
it becomes official,

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:84%
then everyone gets this
weak feeling in their knees

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:90%
and a sinking feeling.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes very important
that we go establish

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.410 align:middle line:90%
a presence in the Mars system.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Mars is not a planet.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a system.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It can tell you what
happens here if we keep up

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.150 align:middle line:90%
on the path we're on.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:10%
Bolden, the head of
NASA, commented--

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.530 align:middle line:10%
he said, going to Mars--
sending humans to Mars

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:10%
is essential to our
future survival,

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:10%

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:90%

they are going boldly where
no small company has ever

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:84%

eventually millions
of people, to Mars

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:10%

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
He's also figured out how to
exploit Martian resources.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Mars was, at one time,
intensely radioactive.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:90%
All of that has disappeared now.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gone.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: We can revive
the biosphere of Mars.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I believe there's still
bacterial remnants of the past.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It won't take
much, then, if that's there.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh, I think
that once we set up a living

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:84%
thing on Mars, you'll
find Mars bacteria

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and other organisms
suddenly appear, just

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.240 align:middle line:84%
like stray cats or dogs, looking
for a meal from our waste

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:90%
products and stuff.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't you think
the Mars bacteria is also

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.407 align:middle line:90%
the Earth bacteria?

00:27:59.407 --> 00:28:00.490 align:middle line:90%
We're all one in the same?

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:01.406 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh yes.

00:28:01.406 --> 00:28:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe very much in what's
called panspermia, which

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.780 align:middle line:90%
was advocated a long time ago.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:84%
The fact that life
on Earth and Mars

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.760 align:middle line:84%
based on the ALH84007 results,
which were, I believe,

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:90%
very solid--

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:84%
life on Mars and
on Earth apparently

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.049 align:middle line:90%
started almost simultaneously.

00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: As soon as there
was liquid water on Earth,

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:90%
you had--

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was the soup.

00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: The soup.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this idea of
the primordial soup suddenly

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.330 align:middle line:90%
spontaneously generating--

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that anymore at all.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
We were seeded
from outer space--

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:44.622 align:middle line:84%
life began in a galaxy far,
far away a long time ago

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:46.455 align:middle line:84%
and apparently spread
throughout the cosmos.

00:28:46.455 --> 00:28:48.413 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's happening
all over the place.

00:28:48.413 --> 00:28:49.332 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: I know.

00:28:49.332 --> 00:28:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe we call
it the God factor,

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:90%
but it's still happening.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Whatever
you want to call it,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:84%
apparently life is
part of the universe.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are part of an
investigation called IMIT--

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:90%
I-M-I-T.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes, it was the
Independent Mars Investigation

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Team, started by
Richard Hoagland.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:10%
>>BRANDENBURG: And
he's a brilliant guy.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:10%
That organization
kind of went away

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:10%
once we presented our results
at the case for Mars 2 project.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, news
spread very quickly

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that we had found what
appeared to be a Mars ocean.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:90%
I had found that.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.377 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Years before government
even announced water on Mars.

00:29:30.377 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: This was in 1984.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that amazing?

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.571 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Well,
the first person

00:29:34.571 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:84%
to propose an extinct Mars
ocean was Percival Lowell.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it wasn't like
it was a new idea,

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
but we had found, based
on the Viking data,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.175 align:middle line:84%
that Cydonia Mensae and
this other place in Utopia

00:29:47.175 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
or Galaxias Chaos,
appeared to be

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:84%
on the shores of
an ancient ocean.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.850 align:middle line:90%
And so we published that.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the Mars
scientists at the conference--

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:90%
I ran into him at Sandia Labs.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:58.950 align:middle line:90%
He was there for a visit.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.149 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, we
really like your Mars ocean.

00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:04.190 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what to
think about your pictures,

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.210 align:middle line:90%
but we liked your Mars ocean.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you just put
a paper out on that?

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:08.840 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And at the Mecca
Conference, I spoke

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:84%
to a audience of about
1,000 Mars scientists

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and showed a vast ocean
covering the north of Mars

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.379 align:middle line:84%
and lasting for most
of Mars's history.

00:30:22.379 --> 00:30:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How deep do you think?

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh, it was
like close to a mile deep.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not as deep as Earth.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: No,
it was not as--

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:84%
it would be more like
the Mediterranean Sea--

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.060 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But it covered Mars, and it's
on the youngest part of Mars.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this ocean
lasted for most

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:90%
of Mars's geologic history.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the
nuclear holocaust

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.170 align:middle line:90%
eradicate the ocean, too?

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes, once you--

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Water on Mars is not stable
unless you have an ozone layer.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you get rid
of the ozone layer--

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything goes.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.681 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: The
ocean evaporates.

00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:06.930 align:middle line:90%
It's broken up by ultraviolet.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
doesn't come back down.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.185 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: No, it
doesn't come back down.

00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:13.700 align:middle line:84%
The oxygen is left behind and
turns the soil bright red;

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:84%
the hydrogen escapes
to outer space.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
know, when I was a kid,

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:84%
without scientific instruments
or anything-- just a kid,

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:26.927 align:middle line:84%
I always thought that some kind
of calamity occurred on Mars.

00:31:26.927 --> 00:31:28.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what it was.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Dick Hoagland
found a science fiction comic

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:40.370 align:middle line:84%
book that talks about a face
on Mars and a great cataclysm

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:41.170 align:middle line:90%
on Mars--

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.044 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way before--

00:31:42.044 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Way before 1958.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:90%
The Space Age had just begun.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Here's the face on
Mars, and it looks

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.475 align:middle line:90%
almost like what they found.

00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:51.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you explain that?

00:31:51.305 --> 00:31:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Well--

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
leaked information?

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: There is--
I believe in the Jungian

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:90%
collective unconscious.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Part of us
knows what happened on Mars--

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.340 align:middle line:84%
have known since Percival
Lowell, by the way.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The same
thing has happened

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.000 align:middle line:84%
with the Oklahoma City bombing
of the federal building.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:90%
It has happened about 9/11.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:84%
There were books written
about things like that

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.130 align:middle line:90%
before they happened.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: "The Fight Club"
shows buildings collapsing,

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and it came out before 9/11,
and they collapsed in the movie

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:90%
just like they did in 9/11.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's bizarre.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.240 align:middle line:90%
It's bizarre how this happens.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.790 align:middle line:10%
>>BRANDENBURG: In fact, when I
saw the movie "Pearl Harbor,"

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:29.830 align:middle line:10%
I thought, something
like Pearl Harbor

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:10%
is going to happen to us.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.660 align:middle line:90%
We're being keyed up for that.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
9/11 happened.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was working for
the Pentagon at the time.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If those on
Mars were destroyed

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:84%
by beings from outside,
what's to prevent those beings

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.650 align:middle line:84%
from coming here and doing
the same thing to us?

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh, whoever
did it, I think, is long gone.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: And I believe
cosmic karma has probably

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.000 align:middle line:90%
caught up with them.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.166 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they blew
themselves up or something.

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Maybe they blew
themselves up, eventually.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, you discover the people
who live very violent--

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.990 align:middle line:84%
they live by the sword,
they die by the sword.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that law
pervades the cosmos.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just not on Earth.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think that it shows
that there or elements

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.000 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:84%
It could be that the
most dangerous thing

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.050 align:middle line:84%
for intelligent
life in the universe

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:84%
is other intelligent
life, as on Earth.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Just turn on the news.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that we
have to become spacefaring.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Our response to this is we
must become spacefaring.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:84%
We must try to achieve Captain
Kirk flying the Starship

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Enterprise around.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had just
mentioned Stephen Hawking.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
exactly at what he said.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Stephen
Hawking, smart guy.

- Stephen Hawking is putting his
"humans must leave Earth in 100

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.060 align:middle line:90%
years" theory to the test.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.190 align:middle line:84%
As part of the series,
Tomorrow's World,

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:02.310 align:middle line:84%
the BBC documentary called
Stephen Hawking Expedition

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Earth will test whether or not
humans will perish in 100 years

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.740 align:middle line:84%
if we don't colonize
another planet.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.900 align:middle line:84%
BBC says the
documentary will show

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
that Professor
Hawking's ambition isn't

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:90%
as fantastical as it sounds.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And that science fact is
closer to science fiction

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:90%
than we ever thought.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:84%
The renowned physicist
has warned the human race

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.480 align:middle line:90%
is in danger for years--

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.510 align:middle line:84%
citing everything from nuclear
war, genetically engineered

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.600 align:middle line:84%
viruses, and long
overdue asteroid strikes.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:10%
And Hawking says that our
best chance for survival

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.480 align:middle line:10%
is to move to another planet--

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.230 align:middle line:10%
the nearest possible solutions
being the moon or Mars.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.030 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.179 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, are
with the Martians?

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.028 align:middle line:90%
Could they have come here?

00:34:39.028 --> 00:34:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It is very
possible that Mars life became

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:49.185 align:middle line:84%
a thriving institution several
million years before it began--

00:34:49.185 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With intelligent
life and everything else?

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.184 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Right.

00:34:52.184 --> 00:34:53.090 align:middle line:90%
I think Mars--

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Mars is a smaller planet.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.610 align:middle line:90%
I think it cooled off quicker.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It achieved an ocean
earlier in its lifetime.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that Mars had
a very active biosphere when

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Earth was still just dealing
with a few little bacterial

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:90%
colonies.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Asteroid impacts on
Mars would have--

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and its next to
the asteroid belt--

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:84%
would have spread
Mars life, which

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.380 align:middle line:90%
would have been more advanced.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
It's possible the
Precambrian explosion--

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.637 align:middle line:90%
which is an explosion of--

00:35:21.637 --> 00:35:23.095 align:middle line:84%
was actually an
invasion from Mars!

00:35:23.095 --> 00:35:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could have been.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Triggered by
an asteroid impact on Mars,

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.051 align:middle line:90%
and it spread--

00:35:28.051 --> 00:35:29.216 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spewed things here.

00:35:29.216 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG:
Spewed things here.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And all this tough,
advanced Mars life arrived--

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:84%
prey/predator/prey
relationships.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
the Earth life

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:90%
had to evolve to deal with that.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually,
the two things

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.540 align:middle line:84%
merged so we are at least
part Martian, at least

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:90%
in a genetic sense.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And we all come from
panspermia anyway.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.245 align:middle line:84%
Might the villains who destroyed
Mars have been the Zecharia

00:35:56.245 --> 00:36:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin Anunnaki that came
here in genetically altered

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.070 align:middle line:90%
creatures that were on Earth?

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Might they be one in the same?

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Once one allows
the idea of intelligent life

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:10.600 align:middle line:84%
traveling between stars,
visiting planets--

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anything's possible.

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: The
possibilities become myriad.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.100 align:middle line:84%
We are already genetically
modifying all sorts of things.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.170 align:middle line:84%
We should be careful
that we don't

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.950 align:middle line:84%
start genetically modifying
ourselves to any degree.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We just may, sadly.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Yes, well,
they used to have a thing

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:90%
called eugenics.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.520 align:middle line:84%
It was a very popular scientific
idea before World War II--

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:90%
after World War II, not so much.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, are you popular
with the personnel at NASA?

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: I
wouldn't say I'm popular.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I would say I'm more
infamous than famous.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are?

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: They've been told
not to talk to me, basically.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
some friends there?

00:36:54.695 --> 00:36:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh, yes, yes.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.885 align:middle line:84%
I've gone down to NASA
headquarters many times, and--

00:36:58.885 --> 00:36:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And enemies?

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:04.573 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.573 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: The
life of a scientist

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.620 align:middle line:84%
is to hope for a
great discovery.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But in making great discoveries,
science is very competitive.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.080 align:middle line:84%
One always creates
enemies when one

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:90%
announces some new discovery.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If all this happened
the way you have unfolded it,

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:84%
what does that mean
to us on this planet?

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It means
the human race is not

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.415 align:middle line:90%
an aberration on the cosmos.

00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:32.415 align:middle line:90%
It's part of its fabric.

00:37:32.415 --> 00:37:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
are a warning for us?

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh absolutely.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Same thing that happened
on Mars could happen to us.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:43.515 align:middle line:84%
We could do it to ourselves,
which is one of my deep fears.

00:37:43.515 --> 00:37:46.020 align:middle line:90%


00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I have three children
and two grandchildren,

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and I want them to grow up free
of the fear of nuclear war.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we
must become spacefaring.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:38:00.810 align:middle line:84%
We can't just sit here
and wait for something

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.720 align:middle line:84%
like happened to
Mars happen here--

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:84%
somebody from outside
the solar system

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.730 align:middle line:84%
comes here, decides
that we're too

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:11.790 align:middle line:84%
noisy, we're too
threatening, and decides

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.810 align:middle line:90%
to put an end to us.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Robert
Oppenheimer, our father

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.260 align:middle line:10%
of the modern age of
nuclear abilities, I think,

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:25.480 align:middle line:10%
developed the atomic bomb
based on old types of writings

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:30.940 align:middle line:10%
that they found in India, and
he was convinced by reading it

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.390 align:middle line:10%
that they had some
kind of nuclear war

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:35.560 align:middle line:10%
that had happened to them.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.190 align:middle line:10%
>>BRANDENBURG: I have read
those passages from the Gitas.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:40.765 align:middle line:90%
It appears that there was--

00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:44.376 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe civilization
here did the same thing.

00:38:44.376 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Well--

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not as bad, though.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.325 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: If you
read the Bhagavad Gita,

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:50.770 align:middle line:84%
it appears like there was an
extraterrestrial colony here

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that, for some internal
reason, had split and then

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.760 align:middle line:84%
had a nuclear war
between each other.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Again.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Again.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.931 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe the same
people who were on Mars.

00:39:01.931 --> 00:39:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Maybe so.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Who knows?

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:84%
The frame of the
occurrences on Mars

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:11.160 align:middle line:84%
seem to have been much earlier
than recorded in the Gitas.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The human race has been around
in its present form on Earth

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.020 align:middle line:90%
for like 200,000 years.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Only 6,000 years
of that do we have

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:90%
any real, substantial record.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.650 align:middle line:84%
We've now found
this place in Turkey

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.500 align:middle line:90%
that is 10,000 years old.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gobekli Tepe.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.320 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.745 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Astonishing
archaeological find.

00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's so
much that we don't know.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: We don't know.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.170 align:middle line:84%
All these legends
of Atlantis, which

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:45.310 align:middle line:84%
said that it was an advanced
civilization of the human race

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and then was wiped out
in some great cataclysm--

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, and I'm
just an Episcopalian--

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.174 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:56.174 --> 00:39:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: I'm
just an Episcopalian,

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.340 align:middle line:90%
but I do read the Bible.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And just before
the story of Noah,

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.010 align:middle line:84%
which records an extinction
level event that wiped out

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.500 align:middle line:84%
most of the human race
and almost all animal

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.360 align:middle line:90%
life on Earth--

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and the people were
saved by this ark

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of vessel--

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
parable somewhere.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.986 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: That's right.

00:40:15.986 --> 00:40:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, it occurs-- and many other
cultures have the same legend.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But just before that, in
the Bible, it is written,

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:84%
it says, the sons of God saw
that the daughters of Earth

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:84%
were very beautiful, and they
took of them wives, whomever

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:37.239 align:middle line:84%
they wanted, and they
got laser-ray guns--

00:40:37.239 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:90%
who's going to stop them?

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to protest?

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.775 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:39.775 --> 00:40:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: And they said the
offspring of these unions were

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:90%
great men of whom many--

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Giants.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:45.791 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG:
--legends are written.

00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Right, well, you can
interpret it as giants,

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:84%
or you can just say men of
great intellectual or physical

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.970 align:middle line:90%
stature.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's in the Bible.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: So all
of these Greek legends,

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.110 align:middle line:90%
all of these legends from--

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's all
laid out for us.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.395 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG:
It's all laid out.

00:41:03.395 --> 00:41:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Beings from the sky
came down and had

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:10.870 align:middle line:84%
unions with Earth women
and produced children--

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:84%
apparently, they'd been cooped
up on spaceships a long time.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way too long.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: And so
this a science fiction

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.850 align:middle line:84%
scenario I will admit,
but it's in the Bible,

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's all these
other legends.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think that especially
when one considers

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:33.250 align:middle line:84%
that we are intelligent life in
the universe and the universe

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:84%
thrives with other
intelligent life,

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that the possibilities are
just beyond comprehension.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, if you
went to Mars today,

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.585 align:middle line:84%
what do you think you
would want to see?

00:41:46.585 --> 00:41:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: I would first
land at Cydonia Mensae and dig.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I would start looking
for cuneiform tablets.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I would look for murals
depicting life on Mars.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.260 align:middle line:84%
All of this stuff would be
buried under many feet--

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:90%
many meters of debris.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it looks
like whatever happened there--

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:12.205 align:middle line:84%
everything is scattered
everywhere in pieces.

00:42:12.205 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It looks like all
archeology on Earth is eroded.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.230 align:middle line:84%
The very same environment
that allows human life

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:24.620 align:middle line:84%
to flourish on Earth also
creates erosive forces

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.500 align:middle line:90%
which destroy our archeology.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.380 align:middle line:90%
And so all archeology is eroded.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.410 align:middle line:84%
The face on Mars, the
pyramid near to it--

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:84%
they look like they're
eroded archeology,

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and that means there's
a lot of buried stuff.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:44.330 align:middle line:84%
We seem to have found what may
have been a city of structures

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.245 align:middle line:90%
near the pyramids.

00:42:45.245 --> 00:42:46.286 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:42:46.286 --> 00:42:47.086 align:middle line:90%


00:42:47.086 --> 00:42:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: It looks like it
housed maybe a million people.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
a great discovery.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
change humankind?

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh, it will
profoundly change humankind.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We should
also look at Mars

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.750 align:middle line:84%
as a blueprint for
what could happen here.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BRANDENBURG: Right.

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.240 align:middle line:90%
We can restore Mars.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.620 align:middle line:10%
We can restore it to life.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.040 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I say, in my
book Death on Mars,

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.250 align:middle line:10%
that we should erect a--

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:10%
if I am correct that there is
a dead civilization on there,

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.120 align:middle line:10%
we should erect a
great memorial to them.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.200 align:middle line:84%
But the greatest
memorial we can make

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.720 align:middle line:84%
to the dead
inhabitants of Mars is

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.247 align:middle line:84%
to revive Mars and make
it a living planet again.

00:43:26.247 --> 00:43:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.770 align:middle line:84%
John, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.478 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Oh,
it's a wonderful honor

00:43:30.478 --> 00:43:31.340 align:middle line:90%
to be here, George.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just remarkable work.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.780 align:middle line:84%
As I was saying, since
I was a little boy,

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.700 align:middle line:90%
I've been fascinated with Mars.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.240 align:middle line:84%
But when you talk to someone
like PhD Dr. John Brandenburg,

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.050 align:middle line:84%
who has spent his life
and career investigating

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:84%
what may have happened
on that red planet,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.150 align:middle line:90%
it is truly remarkable.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:54.230 align:middle line:10%
It is probably one of
the greatest discoveries

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.804 align:middle line:10%
I've ever come across.

00:43:55.804 --> 00:43:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you again, John.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.553 align:middle line:84%
>>BRANDENBURG: Thank
you for having me here.

00:43:58.553 --> 00:43:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fantastic work.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:07.766 align:middle line:90%
