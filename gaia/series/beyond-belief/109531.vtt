GEORGE NOORY: Who
was Edgar Cayce?

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:10%
Edgar Cayce has been called the
"father of holistic medicine,"

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.435 align:middle line:10%
the "sleeping prophet,"
and the most documented

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:10%
psychic of the 20th century.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Cayce was born on a farm in
Hopkinsville, Kentucky in 1877.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
His psychic abilities
began to appear

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:84%
in childhood, when
he was able to talk

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:90%
to his deceased grandfather.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Later in life, Cayce found
that he had the ability

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:84%
to lay down and place his
mind in contact with all time

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and space, the
universal consciousness,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and respond to questions
which he did nearly every day

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:90%
for an astonishing 44 years.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
The result was an incomparable
collection of data that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:90%
came to be called readings.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And their insights offer
practical help and advice

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:90%
to individuals even today.

Well, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:10%
You know, when I
was a young man,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:10%
I was fascinated with
the life of Edgar

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:10%
Cayce, read books on Edgar
Cayce, studied Edgar Cayce.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And who would believe that
later on in my adult life,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I would come across
an individual who

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
he too was interested in
the life of Edgar Cayce?

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So much so, that lecturer and
interdimensional researcher,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Wynn Free, wrote a book
called "The Reincarnation

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
of Edgar Cayce."

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.872 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear who
that person might be,

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:90%
you'll be fascinated.

right now who say,
who was this guy?

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:13.295 align:middle line:90%
Who was Cayce?

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce,
historically, is the most

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
credible and documented
psychic prophet

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:90%
He died in 1945.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And for 40 years of his life,
he would go into a trance.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
He didn't remember
anything he said.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to diagnose
people's health problems,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
even if they weren't
in the room with him.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:10%
He could-- somebody could
say, Joe Schmo in New York.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:10%
And he would go and he would
just say, this is his problems.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:10%
And the people would
go to the doctor,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.021 align:middle line:10%
and the diagnosis would
always be exactly right.

00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY: Wow.
-You know.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even to the point
of red blood cell count,

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and this and that.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Without medical testing?

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
WYNN FREE: Without medical
testing, he did it.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:90%
He was in a trance.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:90%
He didn't remember what he said.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY: Somebody
was recording all that?

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And he had somebody
transcribing it,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and he did 15,000
of these readings.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And not only did he
do health readings,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
but he was recommending to
people alternative cures that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:90%
had never been used before.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And people were using them,
and it was working for them.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even today
there are doctors that swear

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:90%
by Edgar Cayce's remedies.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And most health food stores
have a special selection

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.085 align:middle line:90%
of Edgar Cayce's remedies.

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE NOORY: [CHUCKLES]

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, for 20 years,
he only did health readings.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, remember, it was a mystery.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:90%
How was this guy doing it?

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Who was talking?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
-No trickery here.
-No trickery.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Who was talking through him?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And then after 20 years,
he suddenly gave a reading,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and in that reading, he
included reincarnation.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the reason
the person has this problem

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
is because they did
something in a past life,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
and they were working
out the karma of it.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY: Right.
It carried over.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So for the next 20 years, people
were all asking, who was I?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And he would refer
to those things.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's very interesting.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:84%
For the first 20 years, he
never referred to reincarnation.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.090 align:middle line:84%
The reason is, the source that
was speaking through Edgar

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Cayce, who we're going
to go into-- because all

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.505 align:middle line:84%
through Edgar Cayce's time,
the source was a mystery.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But through the
current who I believe

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:84%
was the incarnation
of Cayce, the source

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:90%
has explained who they are.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's absolutely
riveting of how

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:84%
this fits into the big
picture of the universe.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Cayce believed it was the
Christ speaking through him.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE NOORY: Ah.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:90%
But that's all he said.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say it was Jesus,
it was-- so what's the Christ?

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:90%
It's universal oneness?

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I don't
want to jump the gun.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The way that the Christ
works is so mind-blowing,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and it makes so much
sense when you hear it.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But the source
speaking through Cayce

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to do reincarnation
for the first 20 years

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.297 align:middle line:84%
because Cayce was a
Fundamentalist Christian.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE NOORY: So he backed off.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:90%
The source backed off.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:90%
The source.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to find out
that the source was actually

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.105 align:middle line:84%
a group soul-- it was
not an individual being--

00:05:49.105 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and that it was a group soul
that graduated from this realm.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Wynn, why Edgar Cayce?

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Why was he the one
that was selected?

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, usually when
this happens to people,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
they had a track record
in past lifetimes

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:90%
where they had this connection.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And they can go
through many lifetimes

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
where they don't
have the connection,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:90%
or it's in the background.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's in the world
of possibilities.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
For somebody to channel
and bring this forth,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
usually they had to have
it in their past lives.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And Cayce did.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you
read the Cayce material,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Cayce had a past life in Egypt,
in approximately 10,000 BC.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was a high priest, and he
was doing things like building

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:90%
the pyramids by levitation.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
This was in the
"Cayce Readings."

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
The Hall of Records,
he talked about.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.770 align:middle line:90%
He did it all.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:90%
WYNN FREE: Right, right.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:90%
But who was the source?

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:84%
In the "Cayce Readings," they
never talked about the source,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.210 align:middle line:90%
even in his 10,000 BC life.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
But his name was Ra Ta, and he
was doing miracles of healing.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
He built the pyramids
by levitation.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE NOORY: Ra Ta did.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.545 align:middle line:90%
Ra Ta.

00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was-- OK,
the source identified

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
themselves through the current
guy who I believe is Cayce.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And they explained that
they were a group soul made

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:90%
up of graduates of this realm.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're into
Buddhism, you know

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:84%
that people go through
many, many, many lifetimes.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddhists
talk about getting

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:90%
off the wheel of reincarnation.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
to you when you get

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:90%
off the wheel of reincarnation?

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, there's
a lot of free will.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So no one-- some people can
incarnate in another planet.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Some people can come back
and be an avatar on Earth.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
places is there's

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
a group soul made up of hundreds
of millions of graduates.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
try to assist the planets.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
They do assist planets at
lower levels of evolution.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.810 align:middle line:90%
And how do they assist?

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.016 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing is they can talk
through people in the process

00:08:29.016 --> 00:08:29.715 align:middle line:90%
called channeling.

00:08:29.715 --> 00:08:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So my evidence shows
that Edgar Cayce

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.444 align:middle line:90%
was channeling this group soul.

00:08:37.444 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And as I was
studying all of this,

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
they called themselves
the Ra Group.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And as I was
studying this, there

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:84%
was another woman
that supposedly

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:84%
channeled this same group
soul from the period of 1981

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:90%
to 1983.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And she had put five books out.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
accepted by a small company

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.174 align:middle line:84%
in Pennsylvania that Bob
Friedman, who went on to--

00:09:08.174 --> 00:09:09.140 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE NOORY: They like them.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:84%
 --Bob Friedman accepted
work for that company.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's the guy that published
"Conversations with God."

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just an amazing lineage.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.095 align:middle line:10%
The woman's name
is Carla Rueckert.

00:09:19.095 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And the five books are
called "Ra, Law of One,"

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:90%
and I highly recommend it.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:84%
She even puts them up
on her website for free.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.480 align:middle line:84%
She's so committed
to this whole thing.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you wrote "The
Reincarnation of Edgar

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Cayce,"-- and we're
leading up to identifying

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:84%
the individual whom you think
is the reincarnated Edgar Cayce.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
show you a picture,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
eventually, of Edgar
Cayce and this person

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:90%
And the resemblance is uncanny.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But the individual in
question, was it you who said,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:84%
you're the reincarnated
Edgar Cayce?

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Or was it that
individual who told you?

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:84%
He had a section
on his website--

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
this was in approximately
the year 2000.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:84%
He had a section on
his website called

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:90%
the Edgar Cayce Connection.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And he had all these
channelings on his website.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And he also had all
this scientific stuff

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
trying to prove that we were
going into a dimensional shift.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.424 align:middle line:84%
I read the Edgar
Cayce Connection.

00:10:31.424 --> 00:10:32.390 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE NOORY: On his website.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:90%
On his website.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
He never said he
was Edgar Cayce.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
He said he had a
connection, but he told

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
the story of this connection.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if this guy
is telling the truth,

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
he has to be the
reincarnation of Edgar Cayce.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.484 align:middle line:90%
And he was telling the truth.

00:10:48.484 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
WYNN FREE: To the best
of my investigation--

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I think so too.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:90%
 --he was.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.981 align:middle line:84%
I've known that person
for a number of years.

00:10:53.981 --> 00:10:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Right.
Right.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And even though some of
his thoughts and theories

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
are way out there, I
think he speaks the truth

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and truly believes what he is
investigating and researching.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.415 align:middle line:84%
So the name of this
person-- you're thinking,

00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
who in the heck is
it-- is none other

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:90%
than Gaiam TV's very own David.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.833 align:middle line:90%
Wilcock

00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:90%
WYNN FREE: Right.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY: That is the
person that you believe is

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:90%
the reincarnated Edgar Cayce.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:90%
There's a very uncanny look.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
They've got the same
nose, the same profile.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:90%
It's weird, I'll give you that.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a lot more than
the pictures of resemblance

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:90%
that tie the two together.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
That would not be
enough to convince me.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY:
Explain the tie-up.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
But while you're
looking at the pictures,

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
you can also look at David's
father and Cayce's father.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I've learned it,
we travel in soul groups,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and we meet the same
people over and over again.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know we know them,
except they're familiar to us.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
familiar in a bad way,

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:84%
because we did something
bad in a previous lifetime.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE NOORY: Right.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But the reason that's so
is because when you die,

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:90%
your soul carries your DNA.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And so when the soul
comes into a new body,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:84%
it programs the new body with
the DNA of the past life.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:90%
And that makes sense.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's why that occurs.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the story of what
happened to Wilcock

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.645 align:middle line:84%
was he was living in
New Paltz, New York.

00:12:29.645 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:90%
He graduated college.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:84%
He was studying
metaphysical things.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:90%
He was studying ETs.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of his
was talking to him

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:90%
about recording his dreams.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And David started
recording his dreams.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning,
when he woke up,

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:84%
he had messages,
sentence fragments,

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:84%
as if somebody was
talking to him.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And he thought he
was making it up.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But it was fascinating,
so every night, he

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:84%
would get up and put a pad and
write more of these sentence

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.320 align:middle line:90%
fragments down.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:90%
And there was a lot of wisdom.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:90%
There were like cryptic phrases.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And after a week, one
of these fragments

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.130 align:middle line:84%
made a prediction of something
that would happen to him.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And they said the date it
would happen and the time,

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and it happened.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And now he was saying,
OK, this is not just me.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was ETs
talking to him, OK?

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And for the next year,
he was writing down--

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:90%
he was getting better at this.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead of writing
little fragments,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:84%
he was getting paragraphs,
and page after page

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
after page of this
incredible wisdom, OK?

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Incredible beyond his-- you
know, he was a young man.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
him all the time.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way it
could have come from him.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And then this-- he called
it his dream voice.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And after a year,
his dream voice

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:84%
asked him to move to
Virginia Beach, which he did,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:84%
which happened to be where
the Cayce Institute is.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:90%
That's right, ARE.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And he had learned about
his resemblance to Cayce.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of gave
him a stomach ache, OK?

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I mean--

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:90%
It was a revelation, wasn't it?

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:84%
If you were somebody that
famous and that had influenced

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:90%
that many people, it's scary.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.291 align:middle line:84%
I think I was George
Noory in another lifetime.

00:14:36.291 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:90%
You were.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
In any case, David
saw the pictures,

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and then he found the
pictures of his father

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:90%
connecting to Cayce's father.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And now this voice
that was coming to him,

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:58.780 align:middle line:84%
he was starting to be able to
contact it in his waking state.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting
thing about Edgar Cayce

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.215 align:middle line:84%
is that Edgar Cayce always
channeled in a trance.

00:15:06.215 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
He never remembered
what he said.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.567 align:middle line:84%
And as I was studying
Edgar Cayce--

00:15:11.567 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:90%
And he talked, right?

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And he talked in
this trans state.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he talked.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I intensely studied Edgar
Cayce because I decided-- what

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:84%
happened was I was
writing articles

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:90%
for a metaphysical magazine.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:10%
And I told the editor,
I said, listen,

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:10%
I want to interview this guy.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:10%
And she looked at
his website, and she

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.826 align:middle line:10%
called me back and said, Wynn,
he looks like a wacko to me.

00:15:31.826 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE NOORY: [CHUCKLES]

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
he may be a wacko,

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:90%
but I think he's Edgar Cayce.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:10%
So she said I
could interview him

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:10%
and that she wouldn't promise
to run it until she read it, OK?

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So I interviewed David, and
I sent her the interview.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
She called me back
gasping, saying,

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, you're right.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.330 align:middle line:84%
He has to be Edgar Cayce,
and I think you're supposed

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.360 align:middle line:90%
to write the book about it.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.597 align:middle line:84%
And if she didn't say
that, I don't think

00:15:58.597 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I would've written the book.
-Well, you did a great job.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:00.959 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Does Wilcock-- and we've
talked to him about this,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:84%
but I want to hear it from
you-- does he think he's

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:90%
the reincarnated Edgar Cayce?

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:90%
He knows he's Cayce.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, when he was
going through this period

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
when I was knowing
him, he was getting

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:22.395 align:middle line:84%
so many people hostile towards
him because he would say that.

00:16:22.395 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:90%
And so he doesn't like--

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY: They didn't
like to hear that, did they?

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to
say you were somebody

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:84%
famous without sounding
self-aggrandizing.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you're trying to get
people to pay attention to you.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
very diplomatic.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And David was young and he was--

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Very impetuous.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.281 align:middle line:84%
He got a lot of
hostility for it, OK?

00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:90%
He still does.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.920 align:middle line:84%
You go look on the
internet, and particularly

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
because what he's done
from-- he doesn't emphasize

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.480 align:middle line:90%
channeling at all now.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And what he's done from
that time till now,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:90%
he's made predictions.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.359 align:middle line:90%
They didn't come out, you know.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY: Cayce
made predictions

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.694 align:middle line:90%
that haven't come out yet.

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:09.560 align:middle line:90%
WYNN FREE: Right, correct.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.020 align:middle line:84%
As accurate as he
was with health,

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.299 align:middle line:84%
he hasn't been as accurate
about earth changes,

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a whole section
in the book I wrote, where

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:90%
we talked about earth changes.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Through Wilcock,
there was something

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:84%
very fascinating that
came through in one

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:90%
of his early channelings.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Cayce's most famous channeling,
the most probably duplicated,

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:84%
is his devastation prophecy,
where Europe's going

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:90%
down in the blink of an eye.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.985 align:middle line:84%
And Los Angeles and
Tokyo-- I don't remember.

00:17:40.985 --> 00:17:42.218 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY:
Underwater, everything.

00:17:42.218 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
going to disappear.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.630 align:middle line:84%
He may have been
ahead of his time.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting
thing about that prophecy

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is that it had a
byline, you know.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't Cayce's normal source.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:90%
It was another entity.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And through Wilcock's source,
was saying things like that

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:90%
was from a negative source.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't them.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they tried
to correct it.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Because elsewhere, in the
"Cayce Readings," they said,

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:84%
these changes will
happen gradually.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have this potential
for a negative source.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And they said both
Wilcock and Cayce,

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:90%
at times, had negative sources.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:84%
This is why you
can never ever give

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:90%
up your power to channeling.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it can be a
positive source one day

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and a negative
source another day.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And that prophecy was
designed to create fear

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:90%
and to also discredit Cayce.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:90%
That's what I believe.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And I did a search.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I had the CD-ROM of
the "Cayce Readings."

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And that source had come through
at different times and said,

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I am in the heavens like
Jesus is to your realm, OK?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:84%
What a tempting phrase
to give your power up.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- when you have
a channeled source that uses

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
exalted names, like
even ascended masters.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that's
true in every case,

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:84%
but ascended masters,
Jesus, God, you know.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like anything that tempts
you to give up your power,

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:90%
you have to be very wary of.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
it's not positive.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, this
source, when I searched them--

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, Cayce
had a study group

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that looked at his readings
and came to the conclusion

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that they did not want to
invite this source back anymore.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't trust it.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to have
the regular source which

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.610 align:middle line:90%
they thought was the Christ.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most fascinating
things about this-- and this

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:84%
is something that
a person's going

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
to have to do their
own study, you know,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:90%
investigation, research.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I can't possibly make this
point in this short a time.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But here we have a
group soul that's

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:84%
made up of graduates of this
realm that wants to help us.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of
inequity in this realm.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:90%
We have slavery.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:90%
We have the Annunaki.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I came to the conclusion
that Jesus was very much

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:90%
connected with this group soul.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was one thing in
the book, one statement,

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:90%
that slipped through.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to put this
in the book and David didn't.

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
really important

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:90%
that everyone should--

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:90%
And you got it in.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:90%
I got it in.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:90%
I got this one statement in.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, basically,
this group soul

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:90%
made a comment about Jesus.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:01.671 align:middle line:84%
And this statement has been--
you know where it says,

00:21:01.671 --> 00:21:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Jesus says.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I am the way, I'm
the light, right?

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
"This statement
has been hopelessly

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:14.660 align:middle line:84%
distorted to all sorts of
parsimonious situations,

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:84%
including but not limited
to those who would use it

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:84%
as a means to bolster
their own faith

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and to say that all those
who do not believe in Jesus

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
are forever condemned to an
eternal hellfire of some sort,

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:84%
made gruesome in
its potentialities

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:90%
for prolonged intense suffering.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the masses
of your people

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:84%
insist on some level within
that this inner Christ

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:90%
is what is being accomplished."

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Now get this.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:90%
This is the sentence.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:84%
"Because of the damage we
sustained in our religion,

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:84%
namely Christianity, we often
come to you without ever

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:90%
speaking in these exact terms."

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Now did that come through--

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:84%
WYNN FREE: That
came through David.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
-Through David.
-Yeah.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Interesting.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, so he's beginning to
believe that he's Edgar Cayce.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:84%
What about other people
who begin to know him?

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Do they believe this?

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I would say, I don't
think someone could know

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.381 align:middle line:84%
it unless they read the book--
GEORGE NOORY: First.

00:22:15.381 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
 --first.
Or studied the case.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Or understood Cayce.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, there were
certain things about Cayce.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had studied
Cayce very intensely

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:90%
while I was writing this book.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, somebody
that was living in the Cayce

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:84%
household, the name
was Harmon Bro, who

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:84%
wrote a number of
books about Cayce,

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:84%
was saying that Cayce was
prone to fits of anger.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Part of Cayce did not like
just having people coming over

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.140 align:middle line:90%
and saying, go into a trance.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
His own ego wanted
to express himself.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think in this
lifetime, David needed

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:84%
to express himself and
not just go into a trance

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:90%
and do readings.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And he's done a
bang-up job doing that.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, when the
book came out, David

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and I essentially
went separate ways

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't want to talk
about being Cayce anymore.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:90%
He was over that.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, he didn't
want-- I don't think

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.760 align:middle line:84%
he wanted the resposib-- well,
put yourself in David's shoes,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:90%
You're channeling.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing forth all
this incredible wisdom,

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.565 align:middle line:84%
and there's no doubt
that it's wise.

00:23:29.565 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And your source tells
you that both you

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and Cayce had negative
sources at different times.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, here you are going
out into the world,

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:90%
going to say your Edgar Cayce.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And people are going
to give up their power

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to you, because they're going
to think you know everything.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And David doesn't
know everything.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And Cayce didn't
know everything.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:10%
And originally, David was
scared of having that kind

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:10%
of-- in my opinion, you know,
I'm speaking about David-- was

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:10%
scared about having people
give up their power to him

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.920 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to do
things scientifically

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:90%
and put things together.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:10%
See, there was an
incredible thing

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:10%
that was coming
through his readings,

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:10%
and that we are in the middle
of a dimensional shift.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the end of a
75,000 year cycle,

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and that there is going to
be a separation of souls.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
People were going to
either graduate this realm

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:90%
or repeat it.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And half of the book
is Wilcock's source

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
explaining how that works and
how to win, how to graduate,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:10%
And I thought that was the
most important book I--

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:10%
most important thing I
would ever do in my life,

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:10%
because I had the gut
feeling it was real.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:53.050 align:middle line:84%
When the trances eventually
killed Edgar Cayce--

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
They actually told Cayce
that he shouldn't channel--

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.591 align:middle line:84%
he shouldn't do readings for
more than two people a day,

00:24:58.591 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:84%
or something,
-He would not stop.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Wynn, how do people get a
hold of you or track you?

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:07.075 align:middle line:10%
OK, returnofedgar.com.

00:25:07.075 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:10%
And on that website,
on that page,

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:10%
not only can you get the
book, but you can get--

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:10%
I did an interview with
Wilcock's source in 2003,

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:10%
I believe it was.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:90%
And we talked about the shift.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's a 45 minute
interview with him channeling,

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.617 align:middle line:90%
and it's there.

00:25:26.617 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:90%
All right, very good.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Wynn, thank you so much for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Great work. "The
Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce,"

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:90%
truly very strange.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:10%
You know Dave Wilcock
if you watch "Beyond

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:10%
Belief" and Gaiam Television.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:10%
He is the reincarnated
Edgar Cayce.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.959 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
