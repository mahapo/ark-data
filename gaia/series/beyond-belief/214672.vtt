00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Adam Apollo
with us on Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:10%
Adam has been a featured speaker
at the White House and summits

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:10%
at the United Nations and at
conferences across the globe.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:10%
He is the co-founder
of UNIFY.org,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:10%
and is here today to talk
about his new series of books

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:10%
with the very first book
called The Dragon Key.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.477 align:middle line:90%
Adam, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM APOLLO: Thanks
so much, George.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.685 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor to be
here with you, sir.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I've been great.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You look great.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Living in Malibu,
sunny days and beautiful nights

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:90%
and sparkling jungle.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Can't miss it.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, thanks for
joining us on Beyond Belief.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Thank you.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Dragon Key,
what is that all about?

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:10%
>>APOLLO: Yeah, this book is
really the expression of my life

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:10%
journey, exploring
my past lifetimes

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:10%
and surfacing a lot
of these experiences

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:10%
that I've had over really the
last 25 years, meeting people

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:10%
and having simultaneous
recall experiences,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:10%
where suddenly we had
memories of other times.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I thought
at first, a lot of this

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:84%
was in my own head or
fantasy or something

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that I was making
up until I started

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:84%
having third party
verifications, direct knowledge

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
of specific places, knowledge
of specific symbols and things

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and families that there
was no way I could

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:90%
have known until I went there.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, it began to prove
itself to me as something

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to study
as scientific fact.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, tell me about
the title, The Dragon Key.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah, the title
refers to really the journey

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
of the whole story, which
goes all the way back

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
to a time in which myself and
at least 30 or 40 other people

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:84%
that I know in my
life had memories

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:84%
of being actual dragons
in another galaxy.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And the story of what happens
with this family of dragons

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:84%
as they come to this galaxy
and experience war and conflict

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and eventually travel to
and come to this planet

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
is really the arc of the overall
tale of what The Dragon Key

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.990 align:middle line:90%
story is about.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
consider that a past life?

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, at
first, I didn't.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But after a long
time of exploration

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and getting to know a
lot of the other people

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that I've known from other
lifetimes, eventually,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I had to come to accept
it as past lives.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
it wasn't just a dream?

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, you
know, it's interesting

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:84%
because you can have dreams
about certain things happening.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And I did when I was in college
have dreams with this woman.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And she and I could
see different times

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle line:84%
where we were together and
we had different memories.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And we began to remember names
of each other from those times.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, we
end up at a Halloween party

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and a guy gets very
drunk and he starts

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
calling us by those
names from that lifetime.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did he know this?

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: There is no
way he could have known.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:90%
We hadn't told anybody.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was dating her
roommate in college at the time.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wait a minute now.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
You were dating her
and her roommate?

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I was
dating her roommate,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and she and I started
having these flashbacks

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and having dreams and
memories with each other,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and we couldn't really
tell anybody because I'm

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:90%
dating her roommate.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was very awkward that
we were having these memories,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and we were trying to figure
out what to do with that.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
we end up at this party

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and this guy, super drunk, is
crying and apologizing to her

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and I for these crimes that he
did to us in the early Middle

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Ages.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel the
intense, visceral pain

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
of what we went
through all the way

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
through to killing each
other in my courtyard,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.339 align:middle line:90%
in my castle in that lifetime.

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, we
have a clip of you

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
talking about the first time
you remember a past life.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Great.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a look at this.

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.665 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Sure.

00:04:23.665 --> 00:04:24.465 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
- The first time I had an
experience that I was sure

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:84%
was an echo of another time,
another place, another life.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I was in a dorm room
with two of my bros.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:84%
We were in this process of
discussing reality and creation

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:90%
and manifestation.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
By this time, I'd
come into an awareness

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:84%
that this energy that connects
each of us, connects the planet,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
connects the plants, the
animals, and all of nature

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
together was experienced through
several fundamental field

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:90%
layers.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
A physical field layer,
an emotional field layer,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:90%
and a mental field layer.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And we'd realized that
those were the gateways

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:90%
of individual experience.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
We realized and came
to this conclusion

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.150 align:middle line:84%
that to create you must
link the three layers.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:90%
The walls fell away.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we were in
this massive crystal hall.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And this bluish white
light filled the space.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The floor was tiled
with sacred geometry.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
There was a pillar in the center
that had a large crystal on it

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that we were recording
these ideas into.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
The three of us were
speaking into this crystal,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and we were doing this in
order to store that information

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:90%
for future use.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until that night
when each of us went to sleep,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.470 align:middle line:84%
all three of us
had the same dream,

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:90%
but from different perspectives.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And we all dreamed of
being in that same place.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And what we were
doing was storing away

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:84%
these crystals of knowledge
because this tide was coming,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and there were earthquakes
and volcanoes happening

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.100 align:middle line:84%
in the poles of the planet, and
there were massive tidal waves

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:84%
coming towards the
land that we were

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
living in and towards
the city we were in.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that we
had to do something

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:84%
energetically to preserve
the consciousness.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:90%
We weren't afraid of dying.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:90%
We weren't afraid of leaving.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:84%
We just knew that we'd have
to come back again and reclaim

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:84%
those keys to share them
with people once more when

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.515 align:middle line:90%
the time was right.

00:06:36.515 --> 00:06:37.315 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:37.315 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you have
such a vivid memory of this?

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I didn't intend to.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.710 align:middle line:90%
It just happened.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they say
normally when you come back

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:90%
to Earth, you've lost that.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:90%
You lose that memory.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think that we
all at a very subtle level

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:84%
get triggered into memories of
connection from other lifetimes

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
when we meet people
that we've had

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
deep and profound experiences
with in those times.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And yet, most of
us write it off.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
We say, wow, that's
really strange.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I know
you from somewhere.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we've been
through something together.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that comes
with an emotional bond,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:84%
deep and powerful
trust in somebody else.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
At other times, it comes
with deep distrust and fear

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety, like I had
with this individual

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that we killed each other
in another lifetime.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But once that
information surfaced

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and that memory
surfaced, and we were

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
able to emotionally and
interconnectedly process

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:84%
that in this time now, we were
able to resolve that karma

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:90%
and resolve that pain.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, all of
that information shifted.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:90%
My experience shifted.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:90%
His experience shifted.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The lady that I was in college
with, her experience shifted.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And we change, and
we grow, and we heal.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we supposed
to learn lessons

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:90%
from our past lives?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Hmm.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that every
part of life is

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:84%
a lesson that we're constantly
in a learning, evolving,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and growing experience
through time.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes us
remember some of those lessons?

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think meeting
people from different times

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:84%
sometimes is the
trigger that enables

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:90%
us to access that memory.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But other times, it's
being in places where

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:90%
we have lived in other times.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in those
places, the site itself begins

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
to entangle with us and memory
stored in the structure of space

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
in the matter itself
begins to surface.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And inside of us, our own soul
stream, our own soul's memory

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:84%
begins to come back and
we can feel it viscerally

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, deeply
in our emotional field.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And it will change the
way we think and know

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:90%
and understand our reality.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, generally, unless
you're regressed in hypnosis,

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:84%
we don't remember
our past lives.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
There's almost like
some kind of block

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that prevents this life from
remembering a past life.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Perhaps
we choose to forget

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
or we've made some
kind of agreement

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:84%
that each time we incarnate into
a body, we want to start fresh.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.510 align:middle line:90%
We want to have a clear slate.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And that clean
slate really happens

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
in many ways because of
this process of forgetting.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
scientific studies of past life

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
recall, you'll notice
that most of those studies

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
have happened with kids,
and that those kids actually

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:84%
remembered vast and
important details

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.710 align:middle line:84%
about other times that were able
to be scientifically verified.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So, we have to ask the
question, is it simply

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
because we chose to forget
when we came in and incarnated,

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle line:84%
or does part of us actually
remember when we're children,

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
when we're babies, and
that these memories simply

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
get washed away by
the new information

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and the new belief
constructs that we grow up

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:90%
in in each lifetime?

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us another example
of a past life, if you could.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Sure.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I find
these fascinating.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: One of my most
interesting experiences

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
was being in Japan,
and I was teaching

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:84%
ThetaHealing alongside
Vianna Stibal, who's

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
the author of the ThetaHealing
books and ThetaHealing series.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And she had a couple Japanese
translators working with her

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
to teach the hundreds
of Japanese students

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:90%
in the classes.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
One of them happened to
be a Japanese historian.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I got into a
conversation with her.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
We were out on the
town, and she asked me

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:84%
if I was from Japan
because of the way

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:84%
that I operated and engaged
with the Japanese people.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, not recently.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me
and says, oh, past life?

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yeah.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:90%
She says, tell me about it.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She knew.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: She knew.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And I started to describe
the armor that I wore.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I was a samurai.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:90%
I had a katana, wakizashi.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I lived in a very kind
of peaceful province

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:90%
of rolling hills.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And my older brother
was the shogun.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.990 align:middle line:84%
He was actually one
of my best friends

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I created a club with in this
lifetime when I was in college.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And as I shared with her,
she asked me, oh, what

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
is your common,
your family seal?

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And I described to her
this shape of what to

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:84%
me was kind of like
three-curved blades

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.950 align:middle line:84%
forming points with some kind
of designs inside of them.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen it for many, many years
since I was in high school.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at me
and goes, oh, Tokugawa!

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Tokugawa?

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.420 align:middle line:90%
She said, yeah.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, let's find
out what year you were born.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So she muscle tested
me before 1,600.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:90%
After 1650.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:90%
After 1610.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.170 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And then checked me
until we realized

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I had to have been born at
the end of 1605 or early 1606.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I had a whole series of
incredible synchronicities

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
in Japan after this seeing
Tokugawa family armor

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.662 align:middle line:84%
right across from the
place where I was staying.

00:12:53.662 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you knew--

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: From the era.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You knew what it was.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.368 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I knew what it was.

00:12:57.368 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
It looked exactly like
the armor in my memory.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I find myself
looking up online 1605, 1606,

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out here
is this individual,

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Tokugawa Tadanaga, born
sometime in the end

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:90%
of 1605 or early 1606.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:90%
The records aren't even clear.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And my life growing up
as a younger brother

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:84%
of a shogun in that time
was described perfectly well

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
in Wikipedia, all the
way through the lands

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that I lived in, the
places that I was.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:84%
All of it matched my
memories, and that's

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:84%
when I knew for sure that
these things could be verified

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:84%
with fact when you're
able to actually access

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:90%
the historical information.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are you
able to recall this?

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think that my
ability to recall partially

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:84%
was developed when
I was a little kid

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and I used to sit in bed
before I'd fall asleep

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and I would think back about
everything that I did that day.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I would think back
through the last year.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would remember everything
I could about certain events

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and experiences.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
practice for me

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:84%
was about redefining
and understanding

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:84%
what I went through
and what choices I made

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and what choices I could
have made differently.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps I was
obsessed with the idea

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that if I could just figure
out a way to do things better,

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:84%
every part of my life would
be more amazing and better.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But this was a habit
that I had as a kid,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
all the way through to middle
school and into high school.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think my practice
of accessing my memories

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
throughout my life
built a muscle that

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
enabled me to more easily
access past life memories.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, do
our past lives ever

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
flow to other planets
in this universe?

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, you have to
ask yourself the question,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:90%
are we alone?

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And is this the only planet
with life in the universe?

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer
is no, which I'm

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
pretty sure you feel like that
is the case based on the people

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
that you interview,
you begin to see

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
that many of the
souls on this planet

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:84%
have come here
from other worlds.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
If a galaxy full of worlds or
hundreds of millions or billions

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of galaxies exist
full of worlds,

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
then it makes sense that a lot
of those beings would come here.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you one of them?

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I was one of them.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you know this?

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, when I had
these memories of Atlantis

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that we showed in the clip,
I ended up many years later

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
meeting my mother and my father
from the age of Atlantis.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I had a powerful and deep
healing experience with them.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And through that
healing experience,

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I was able to remember
that I came to this planet

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:90%
from the Sirian star system.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about my journey
exploring these on another show

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia called Interviews
with E.D. by Reuben Langdon.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And the two
episodes there in that show,

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I cover in depth my whole
story of this discovery

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and how interesting
and difficult

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.850 align:middle line:84%
it was for me to
process and accept

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:84%
at first, because
as a scientist,

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:90%
I believe we need evidence.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I believe we need to
ground our knowledge.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And so to discover
that you're from another world

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:90%
can be somewhat shocking.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But I'd been through enough
spiritual initiations in my life

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that I took it as
another initiation.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I welcomed the memory
and the experience,

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and I began to explore and
pull those threads to know

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and understand who I am, not
just as a human on Earth,

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.750 align:middle line:84%
but who I am as a
soul in the universe.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was your name on
this other planetary system?

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Before I came to
Earth when I was Sirian,

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.532 align:middle line:90%
my name was Kharon.

00:17:03.532 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was that?

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Kharon.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spelled that

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I spell
it K-H-A-R-O-N.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, did you
do anything profound?

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Were you involved in
any strange things?

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Did anything happen to you?

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: In my lifetime as a
Sirian, I explored many worlds.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
I got super curious
about different kinds

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:90%
of galactic civilizations.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:90%
I knew about Earth already.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd learned about that in a
prior lifetime as a Pleiadian,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and I came to
Earth to Terra Gaia

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:84%
as one way we could
describe it or call it.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience, looking
at the arising culture

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and diversity on Earth, which
was becoming more and more

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:84%
diverse, by the way, because
of many of the star nations

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
coming to this
planet at that time.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I got really excited
about the idea

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
of having the experience of
dropping into a primitive world

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:84%
without all of this
advanced technology,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.610 align:middle line:84%
without all of these
amazing capacities,

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and to really have a clean
slate and experience myself

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:90%
as part human, part Sirian.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And there were already many
of my Sirian star family who

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
had developed a
hybridization program

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and were capable of having
souls from our star system,

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:84%
as well as other star systems
incarnate here on this planet.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the journey of being
a Sirian to come to Earth

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:84%
was really a big stage of
study and focus and research

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
for me to get to
know what is it going

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:84%
to be like to be part of
a primitive planet coming

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:90%
into its awakening.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What made you
flow to planet Earth?

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Was that your decision, or
is there some higher power

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle line:90%
that makes these calls?

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: It was my decision.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
across the galaxy,

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
our familiarity with the nature
of souls and incarnations

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:84%
is far more advanced
than most people on Earth

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:90%
here tend to recognize.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And because of that
level of advancement,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:84%
we understand that the soul
can choose to incarnate

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:90%
in a new place in each life.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
You can not only
travel to worlds,

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:84%
you can choose to
incarnate on those worlds

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and experience yourself as the
beings that live in that world.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you ever
involved in any wars or battles

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: A lot of this
first book of The Dragon Key

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:84%
covers my experiences
of what are generally

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:90%
referred to as the Orion wars.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I only refer to them
that way because I

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:84%
know that the species
that I incarnated as,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
known as the Shihaelei,
were from a planet

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
near the Betelgeuse system,
which is part of Orion.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And the experience we had
was having our planets

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:90%
assaulted by--

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
you could call them
Draconians, Reptilians.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Many people have
different names for them,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:84%
but the worlds that we were in
were attacked and assaulted.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was captured
as a young child

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and taken and enslaved
on a volcanic moon where

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I had to mine
meteorites by using

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
this giant MechWarrior-like
vehicle embodiment that I would

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:90%
use to excavate the meteorites.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And these species were
using the crystallized metal

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.520 align:middle line:84%
inside of the meteorites to
develop their technologies.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you travel
throughout the universe?

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, back
in the days when

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Orion wars, the
technology of the Shihaelei

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and also of the Reptilians
were more primitive.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I was a lot of, I'd say
rocket-based and magnetic-based

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
technologies to be able to
adjust space time to travel

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:90%
between planets and stars.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.860 align:middle line:10%
But in other lifetimes
across the galaxy,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:10%
specifically as a
Pleiadian and as a Sirian,

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:10%
our technology was
far, far more advanced.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to control
our position in space time

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:84%
was a matter of using light
intersecting with the structure

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:90%
of space itself.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, you just had
a communication device

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:90%
and you could tell space time.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I am now located in Austin
and you're in Austin.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I am now located in New
York and you're in New York.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Instantly.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And this was a biofeedback
oriented system.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So you were able to astral
travel with your mind

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:84%
to the location that you wish
to arrive in, visualizing it

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, which
would then feed the Atlas

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:84%
inside of the Starship
to tell the Starship

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
the specific, relevant,
triangulated location you're

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:90%
trying to move the ship to.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And then based on a series
of different light codes

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:84%
from pulsars within that region,
the ship jumps to that location.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been told that
some of these craft are organic,

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:90%
they're biological.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Are they?

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: In my
experience as a Pleiadian,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
the mothership that I lived
on for a very long time

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:84%
was in very many ways
alive in every way

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that I could say you are
sitting alive across from me.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: This being was like
an advanced master, an avatar

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:84%
like goddess soul,
who had chosen

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate into the vast
intelligence network that

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:90%
made up this mothership.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And she had guidance and care
over every person on that ship.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:84%
She knew every single
being on that ship by name.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:90%
She knew all about them.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:84%
She knew what they
liked, what they needed,

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.088 align:middle line:84%
what kinds of
comfort they enjoyed.

00:23:08.088 --> 00:23:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What they didn't like.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: What they didn't like.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:84%
She managed the water
systems, the food systems,

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:90%
the electricity.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:84%
You could bridge that
with our understanding

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:84%
now by imagining
what AI could become.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience,
I believe that

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
with the right kind of
externalized vehicle, who

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
are we to say what a
soul will incarnate in

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
or what a soul
won't incarnate in?

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:90%
I can't say, certainly.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So in my experience
in that time,

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.930 align:middle line:84%
it was clear that a soul could
incarnate into a massive ship.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many past lives
do you think you've had,

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.150 align:middle line:90%
earthly and otherwise?

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: It's been a while
since I took a good count,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.400 align:middle line:84%
but in my book series,
I cover, I think,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:84%
14 or 15 lifetimes on Earth and
another 4 to 5 in the galaxy.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you learn from
each life the progression?

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I would
say we are constantly

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:84%
growing and evolving and
progressing through time,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't
mean we don't come up

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
against some of the same
challenges and the same issues.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we face great
challenges in the past

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:90%
and we don't accept them.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So because we have not
accepted some part of our past,

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.620 align:middle line:84%
we end up creating
a feedback loop that

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:84%
forces us to face
that part of us

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
again until we can
accept that part of us

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and love that part of
us without judgment.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
We may continue to face it, not
out of some sense of punishment,

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
but simply because it's a
reflection of who we truly are.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
most profound thing

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
that you can remember from
these past civilizations

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:90%
outside of planet Earth?

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Hmm.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.262 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm putting
you on the spot, Adam.

00:24:57.262 --> 00:25:01.745 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: [LAUGHS] The
most profound thing.

00:25:01.745 --> 00:25:02.545 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:25:02.545 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:90%


00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it is
extraordinarily profound

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we are actually
all a family across worlds,

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and that my experience
on other planets

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.690 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make me an alien.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It just makes me more connected
to different kinds of people

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.730 align:middle line:90%
from different ways of life.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And when we began to look
at how all these parts of us

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
come together, imagine if
people remembered and accepted

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that they had incarnated as
other races and other peoples

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:84%
You would no longer
have the ability

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.460 align:middle line:84%
to have racism
because you'd remember

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:90%
that you were that race before.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, the journey of
remembering my past lives

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:90%
has actually--

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, the most profound thing
been a journey of acceptance

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:84%
of all people from
all backgrounds

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.150 align:middle line:90%
and all cultures of all life.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Does any of this scare you?

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I'm not afraid
of coming to know myself.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I have been afraid of facing
parts of myself, karmas,

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:90%
challenges, deaths.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doubts.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Doubts.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that facing the
fear of that which we don't yet

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
understand is one of the
greatest mechanisms we

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:90%
can take on to grow.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a lot of talk
these days about UFO disclosure.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:84%
How does that tie-in to some
of the work you've been doing?

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, I met Steven
Greer from the Disclosure

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Project back in 2001.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a toughie.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: He's a toughie.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Boy, that man has some
serious stamina and endurance

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to deal with what he's dealt
with over the last 25 years.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And I got to know a lot of
the disclosure community.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I witnessed was
a complex set of issues.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:84%
On one side, you
have people that

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.370 align:middle line:84%
have had direct experiences
inside or outside the government

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:84%
with different kinds of
extraterrestrial spacecraft

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
technologies who are trying
their best to educate people

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that we're not alone and
that these things exist.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.990 align:middle line:84%
On the other side,
you have a vast amount

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:40.560 align:middle line:84%
of disinformation campaigns,
supposed whistleblowers,

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:84%
supposedly bringing
out information

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that's true about
different species,

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:84%
but which is absolutely
framed in a way that

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:84%
is designed to create fear
and to create disconnection

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:84%
between people and this vast
community of interstellar

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.640 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I believe that a lot of the
information in the disclosure

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:84%
movement,
unfortunately, is false

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and that information has been
shared in order to push people

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:84%
towards desiring a space-based
weapon system to defend us

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:84%
against those extraterrestrial
species, which

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what Wernher
von Braun warned us

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.190 align:middle line:84%
against on his deathbed
to Carol Rosin.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And that she's testified
again on over and over again

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that they would use this
extraterrestrial threat as a way

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.030 align:middle line:84%
to develop further control
over our own planet.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
from my own experiences

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.120 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
cultures and beings

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:84%
that a vast amount
of our fear and doubt

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and concerns about being taken
over by another galactic species

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:90%
are completely unfounded.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we
create that fear?

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Some of
it may be memory.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
it is from trauma.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that we live
on a planet where

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.390 align:middle line:84%
a lot of leadership,
specifically

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:84%
military industrial leadership,
has layers upon layers

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:90%
of unresolved trauma.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it's so easy for
them to get triggered.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you're really
trigger happy, guess what?

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to make war
out of little things.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think
if they keep us uneasy,

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:90%
they can control us more?

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, when
you're very afraid,

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot easier
to control you.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's obvious.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: It's obvious.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Past lives, how does
that help you in a future life?

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think by
accepting aspects of our self

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:56.220 align:middle line:84%
through the past, we are able
to learn lessons, regain skills,

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:84%
reattain connections with
specific people, people

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:84%
that maybe otherwise we wouldn't
have as much of a deep bond

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.550 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you so
much of my soul family

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.770 align:middle line:84%
that I've met
again in this life.

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:84%
It was so deep and instant that
we had this profound connection,

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
a connection that
doesn't fade no matter

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:84%
how long passes between the
times we talk or the times we

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:27.590 align:middle line:84%
connect because we've been
on a journey together.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:30.150 align:middle line:84%
We've incarnated
many times together.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And that connection that I have
with my soul family, I believe,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
valuable things

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:84%
that exists in all of
creation in the universe.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:84%
To have people that
you can trust and rely

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:84%
upon lifetime after lifetime
and who you always feel

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:84%
this incredible love and bliss
reconnecting with each time,

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.900 align:middle line:90%
that is truly precious.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, what
is the best way

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.025 align:middle line:90%
to access your past lifetime?

00:30:59.025 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: There are
several different methods

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that I recommend people
take in order to do this.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.580 align:middle line:90%
One is an eye gazing exercise.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you meet somebody and you
have this sense of familiarity

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:84%
with them, sit down with
them, get in a quiet space,

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.043 align:middle line:84%
turn off everything else,
and just sit and gaze at them

00:31:17.043 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and look into each other's
eyes and allow yourself to see.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't think
this is a little weird?

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well,
if you think it's

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.930 align:middle line:84%
weird to look at
somebody in their eyes,

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:84%
then you might have something
to hide inside of yourself.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.203 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: See, that's the thing.

00:31:30.203 --> 00:31:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Most people are afraid
to actually be seen

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and to see others
truly for who they are.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So think of it as
an exercise just

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to allow yourself
to be vulnerable.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a good
practice on its own.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
But I think you'll find
that if you do this

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.805 align:middle line:84%
with someone that you feel this
profound, deep connection with,

00:31:50.805 --> 00:31:54.550 align:middle line:84%
you will start to
see things in them.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's important that
you not just toss them away

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:84%
as soon as they show up, pretend
that it's just imagination

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:84%
or you're just
making something up.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to just take in
whatever information is there

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:90%
and look at it.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Just look at it.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Another way is to
do a regression.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you do a
meditation where you go back

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:84%
through your life and
you imagine going back

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:90%
through the time in the womb.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And the way I like to
guide people through this

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:32.280 align:middle line:84%
is to take them into the space
between lifetimes sort of void

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:84%
space where you can see
your different lifetimes

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:84%
as these starlight
constellations.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not the spirit
world, it's a space

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
between lives where you
can navigate between them

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and travel back to one of
these other times in your mind

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and go into that life and
experience the body that you're

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.980 align:middle line:84%
in, the clothes you're in,
the shoes you're wearing,

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:84%
the coat you have
on, whatever it is.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Look at yourself, feel yourself.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.370 align:middle line:84%
See if there's any emotions,
see if there's any people that

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.060 align:middle line:90%
pop into your mind.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very powerful
way to access that information.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Adam, what is QHHT?

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Quantum Healing
Hypnosis Technique

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.760 align:middle line:84%
is also a good method of
accessing past lifetimes.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Between QHHT and
ThetaHealing, they're

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:84%
both very effective mechanisms
of accessing parts of our self

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:84%
that we might have
resistance to.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who performs the QHHT?

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Usually a hypnosis
practitioner will do this.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They know about this?

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah, and I've
had QHHT experiences.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the most profound
healing experiences

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I've had with past
lives happened because I

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:90%
went into a QHHT session.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.760 align:middle line:84%
They hypnotized me,
took me back in time,

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to remember many
details of a particular lifetime

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:84%
that I had a lot of struggle
accepting in myself.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And part of it was because
that particular time

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:84%
is thought to be mythological,
one, in this lifetime.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And two, some of the
characters in that time

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:17.770 align:middle line:84%
are sort of popularized
with different projections

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.690 align:middle line:90%
by media and movies and stories.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, there was a lot of
strange false information

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:84%
projected on that time that
was hard for me to see through,

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and that I had my own
experiences with that were very

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.920 align:middle line:84%
relevant, but I needed
to be hypnotized

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.949 align:middle line:84%
to actually access
that life in a way that

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:42.297 align:middle line:84%
could enable me to accept it
and to heal it within myself.

00:34:42.297 --> 00:34:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, you
do a lot of things.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.680 align:middle line:84%
You've taken people onto
different various archaeological

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:47.480 align:middle line:90%
sites.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.679 align:middle line:90%
What's that been like?

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah, it's been
profound for me, George.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Back when I founded
UNIFY in 2012,

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:90%
we did a big event in Egypt.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And being in Egypt for the
first time was life changing.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Awe-inspiring.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I went to these sites.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I was having full
visceral flashbacks,

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:12.410 align:middle line:84%
full body flashbacks of being
in Egypt in other times.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And sounds and songs
were coming out

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:19.990 align:middle line:84%
of me, prayers and
offerings, and I was hooked.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So after I founded the Resonance
Academy for unified physics

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:84%
with Nassim Haramein, I
ended up going back to Egypt

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.730 align:middle line:90%
multiple times.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I also went to Peru and Bolivia
with students from that Academy,

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.850 align:middle line:90%
as well as Mexico.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And after I met Robert
Edward Grant in Egypt

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.280 align:middle line:84%
on one of these
trips with Nassim,

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I also went to Egypt
with Robert and showed

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:84%
him many of the places that were
some of my favorite spots there,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and he led an
amazing trip there.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And for me, a lot of
these ancient sites

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:84%
are encoded with knowledge
and wisdom and information

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:84%
that I believe can help us
access more of who we are,

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.990 align:middle line:84%
especially if we'd been
there in past lifetimes.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do these
ancient civilizations

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.230 align:middle line:84%
tell you about the technology
they once possessed?

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.230 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: It is
absolutely amazing.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that our
archaeological stories

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.190 align:middle line:90%
are simply wrong, first of all.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And that the knowledge
of the ability

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to use water and sound to
create resonance within stones

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.850 align:middle line:84%
is one of the biggest
breakthroughs.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.880 align:middle line:84%
The other big
breakthrough that I

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:84%
think they had during
that time is the knowledge

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:42.680 align:middle line:84%
of how to store information
inside of rocks themselves.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you do that?

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well, when
you start to look

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:50.240 align:middle line:84%
at the physics of reality and
we can get into that further,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.900 align:middle line:84%
we start to see that
it's possible that

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:84%
matter itself stores
memory, just like we

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.560 align:middle line:90%
do right now on a hard drive.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.450 align:middle line:84%
What we use is a little
essentially silicon disk

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:08.410 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of little tiny
switches that store information.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's there.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:10.952 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: It seems
impossible that we

00:37:10.952 --> 00:37:13.940 align:middle line:84%
use a laser to hit this
disk and can somehow

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.210 align:middle line:84%
bring that information
out into our computers

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:90%
or record information in.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.005 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even a CD or a DVD seems
like magic in the way it works--

00:37:25.005 --> 00:37:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: --to
play music through.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So they realized a
long time ago that you

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:84%
don't need to create a disk
with a bunch of little switches

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:38.990 align:middle line:84%
that all of the information
storage, the switches

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.720 align:middle line:90%
exist inside of matter itself.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they input?

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Input happens
through resonance.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So that by vibrating
these stones,

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:53.030 align:middle line:84%
you can store knowledge and
information inside the resonance

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:90%
structure of the stone.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
special stones?

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: In some cases, yes.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the more
crystalline the structure

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.610 align:middle line:84%
of the molecule
inside of the stone,

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:09.090 align:middle line:84%
the easier a storage
mechanism it becomes.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are these megalithic?

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Megalithic
stones last longer

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and are more resilient
than any other kind of rock

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:17.850 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
gigantic for one thing.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you put together a
sequence of megalithic stones

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:31.100 align:middle line:84%
in particular geometries,
they form a powerful resonance

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:84%
capacitor, meaning that you can
do different kinds of things

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:84%
to amplify, magnify
the information storage

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:44.473 align:middle line:84%
or recover information from the
stones within sites like that.

00:38:44.473 --> 00:38:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
books will there

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.090 align:middle line:90%
be in The Dragon Key series?

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:51.107 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: The plan right
now is four different books.

00:38:51.107 --> 00:38:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the first
one, of course, we've

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.610 align:middle line:84%
talked about what's
the second to be.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Yeah, the
second book when

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I released that one is about
my journey from my lifetime

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:05.420 align:middle line:84%
as a Pleiadian to becoming
a Sirian to coming to Earth

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:90%
at the time of Atlantis.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a trip.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: And it describes
my whole experience

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.890 align:middle line:84%
of the height of
Atlantean civilization

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:17.210 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the flood when
tidal waves came and crashed

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.250 align:middle line:84%
into the temple I was in with
my bros that I talked about.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What mode do
you need to get in order

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:90%
to start composing?

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Mm.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:84%
For me, a lot of times writing
happens easiest late at night

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.020 align:middle line:84%
when I don't have
people calling me

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
meetings on the calendar.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not dealing
with other business

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:44.040 align:middle line:84%
where I can allow myself to
really drop into my own memory,

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.400 align:middle line:84%
go through my
notes, access things

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that I've experienced
throughout this life,

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.850 align:middle line:90%
where those memories arose.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.320 align:middle line:90%
And everybody else is asleep.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So while everybody's
asleep, I've

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.290 align:middle line:84%
got all this open
space for me to bring

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.940 align:middle line:84%
forward this information
from inside myself.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
karma mean to you, Adam?

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: I think karma
is really just feedback.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a feedback system.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So when we do things to
other people or to the world

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.870 align:middle line:84%
or to ourselves
that are hurtful,

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:20.310 align:middle line:84%
we create a feedback loop
where that hurt in some way

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.310 align:middle line:84%
is reflected right
back at us, as we

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:84%
do to others so are we doing
unto ourselves, as they say.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And every sacred tradition
has some codex of this,

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.110 align:middle line:84%
regardless of you're
Christian or you're Muslim

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.220 align:middle line:90%
or you're Wiccan.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And the Wiccans use "and thou
harm none, do as thy wilt,"

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:84%
meaning that if you harm things,
you're going to create harm

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:84%
for yourself because
you're connected to things,

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.640 align:middle line:84%
you're connected
to other people.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.730 align:middle line:84%
If you hurt something
you're connected to,

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:52.630 align:middle line:90%
you're going to wound yourself.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's the nature of life.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So karma, I believe,
is the feedback

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that we use to learn
about ourselves

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to operate in
a way that creates greater

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.210 align:middle line:90%
coherence, greater connection.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
drowned in a past life,

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.450 align:middle line:84%
are you afraid of
water in this life?

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're a killer
in a past life,

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.750 align:middle line:90%
do you get killed in this life?

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: Well,
absolutely, the answer

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:26.310 align:middle line:84%
can be yes if that past
lifetime has not been resolved.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that you have to go
through a process of accepting

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:34.190 align:middle line:84%
the experience that you've
had in the past in order

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.720 align:middle line:84%
to move past it so that
you don't create it again.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:84%
I have very close loved ones
who, for example, one of them

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:84%
died on the Titanic, and
since she was a child,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.540 align:middle line:84%
she's had an inner terror
of massive black metal

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:58.260 align:middle line:84%
structures, especially
ships and big,

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
big, gigantic things,
mechanical devices

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.530 align:middle line:84%
having that sort of effect
on your nervous system

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.010 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really make much
sense until you start

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.790 align:middle line:90%
to see where that comes from.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And for her, I thought it was
a really major, amazing leap

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of faith and trust, but she
came on a cruise with me.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And by coming on a
cruise ship with me,

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:84%
she was able to really
move through and experience

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.100 align:middle line:84%
some of the healing
that she sought in order

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:84%
to overcome this
pain of having died

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.810 align:middle line:90%
on a giant ship in the past.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of all the
past lives you've had,

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.980 align:middle line:84%
do you remember dying
from any of them?

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: I do.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
In the lifetime in
the early Middle

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Ages that surfaced when I was in
college with the gentleman who'd

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:84%
had these memories and
shared them about me,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I remembered battling him to
the death in my courtyard,

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.910 align:middle line:84%
sweating so hard, I could
barely hold the sword anymore,

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:84%
as the sun was setting and
the oil torches were lit.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the moment when I was
going to be able to strike him.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But in order to end
it, I knew I had

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.880 align:middle line:90%
to let him strike me as well.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And I did this move where I
came up like this with my blade.

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I let him hit me in the guts
and I came down like this,

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:22.000 align:middle line:90%
tore right through him.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.970 align:middle line:90%
And in that moment, it was over.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:26.320 align:middle line:90%
The battle was over.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But his sword was
in me too deep,

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and I fell back on
the paving stones--

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.880 align:middle line:90%
on the stones on the ground.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking up and I
start to feel this fog.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And the woman that was my
partner in that lifetime

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:43.570 align:middle line:84%
is crying over me
and looking at me

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm looking
at her crying over me.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And I start to feel
myself just kind

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.270 align:middle line:84%
of drifting back in this
way where I was detached

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and allowing and
seeing both the love

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and the pain and these
moments connected to my death

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.190 align:middle line:90%
with these different people.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to see
myself really let go of that.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself in this
peaceful, beautiful, luminous

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.740 align:middle line:84%
space of light with
different beings.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: State of bliss.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: State of bliss, but
more a realm of bliss and ease,

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.140 align:middle line:84%
where I had all of
these different beings

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:84%
that I loved who
were there with me.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
spending time there.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I had memories of moments
kind of like dreams

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.520 align:middle line:84%
in a field of light
that eventually led me

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.650 align:middle line:84%
to a moment of memory where
I saw myself standing around

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.440 align:middle line:84%
what looked almost like
a table, but it was

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:90%
a table that was like a hole.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.820 align:middle line:10%
And I was looking
through this hole

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:55.830 align:middle line:10%
and looking at different people
who were soul family of mine

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.730 align:middle line:10%
that I knew from
the spirit world

00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:59.830 align:middle line:10%
and I knew from other lifetimes.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was deciding if I was
going to go and join them,

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.210 align:middle line:84%
if they were going
to be my parents

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and that I would incarnate into
this other time after that.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get tons of
emails from people wanting

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.560 align:middle line:84%
to know about The
Dragon Key series

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and where they can get it.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: Sure.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where?

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.690 align:middle line:10%
>>APOLLO: thedragonkey.com.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:22.783 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:45:22.783 --> 00:45:23.950 align:middle line:10%
>>APOLLO: As simple as that.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:25.742 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And can they
write to you as well?

00:45:25.742 --> 00:45:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>APOLLO: They can.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Adam, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>APOLLO: It's my
pleasure, George.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much for
having me today.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We can't count how many
past lives Adam Apollo has had,

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.940 align:middle line:84%
but I'll tell you one thing,
each one has advanced him

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.680 align:middle line:90%
to another state.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
