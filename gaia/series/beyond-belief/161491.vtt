00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:10%
He's a regular on our
"Coast to Coast" AM

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:10%
radio program, Jason Martell,
an expert in ancient mysteries

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.470 align:middle line:10%
and technologies.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're here today
to talk about a lot

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
of different facets of what went
on and what is going to happen.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.011 align:middle line:90%
Jason, welcome to the program.

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:41.135 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON MARTELL: Thanks
for having me back, George.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are a great
researcher, my friend.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really get
into things in a big way.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.120 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: It's
nice to have passion

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:10%
around certain topics,
and ones that you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:10%
can share with other people.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were a little boy,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.830 align:middle line:84%
were you always interested
in strange little things

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.337 align:middle line:90%
like this?

00:00:56.337 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Probably.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.558 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was raised as a
very heavy Christian influence.

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:84%
And as I got older, I had a lot
of questions about the Bible.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So I think I was always
prone to wanting to know more

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and having a little itch to want
to find out and ask questions.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you go out and
start searching for information

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
about some of these mysteries,
the ancients especially,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.724 align:middle line:90%
how do you start?

00:01:19.724 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well,
usually it begins

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
with trying to
answer a question.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Some of these sites kind
of have an overriding theme

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.440 align:middle line:84%
that point to certain
questions, meaning monuments

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
built around the world
all have some type

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.787 align:middle line:90%
of astronomical purpose.

00:01:34.787 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that some
of these ancient sites

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
would be built to protect their
clan or protect their village,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:84%
yet they went to great
lengths to observe the stars.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
research, for me,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
just brings up questions
trying to understand

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.810 align:middle line:84%
the context of what they
were doing in the past.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about them, and how

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:84%
does that tie into the
procession of the equinoxes?

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Every
culture around the world

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
seems to have had this
lost connected language.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Before the gods came down
and confused our languages,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:84%
they had a language
of astronomy,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and we know that today
because every culture,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:84%
every continent built structures
to monitor the heavens

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and watch very accurately
as we progressed

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.865 align:middle line:90%
through these different ages.

00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be
something that's

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
very important and embedded
into the ancient knowledge.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So yet today we're
trying to understand

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
why they built the megaliths,
and even more importantly,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.009 align:middle line:84%
how they did it
with such precision.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, but we know
they did it, don't we?

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.008 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: We definitely
know that they did it,

00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:90%
and they did it for a reason.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.688 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
Zachariah Sitchin

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and his work "The
12th Planet", wrote

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
that there's another
planet in our solar system.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Comes around every 3,600 years.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
of that theory?

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.626 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, as
you and I both know,

00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Zacharia Sitchin put in a
very esoteric level of work

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
studying Semitic
languages for 50 years.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting
about his research

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
is there were a couple
of points that are still

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
topics in mainstream science,
even though Zacharias

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin passed away a few
years ago at the age of 93--

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:90%
very impressive.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
But one of the overriding
topics that he brought up

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.526 align:middle line:84%
in the paranormal circles
was this term Planet X.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And what's been really
interesting about that term,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Planet X, is the
scientific community

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
has also latched on to this idea
that over the last 20 years,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.144 align:middle line:84%
something seems to be
pulling on the planets.

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking for
something called a Planet X.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And Sitchin wasn't
using space science

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.550 align:middle line:90%
as his repertoire of knowledge.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:90%
He was looking at the ancients.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was looking at the
Sumerian tablets and things

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:90%
like that, right?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Exactly.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And so there's just a lot
of research and knowledge

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
that is still left in
these ancient tablets, some

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient tales
talking about the creation

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:90%
of the solar system.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So Zacharia Sitchin's
interpretation

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
of this information was rather
groundbreaking in the terms

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:90%
of talking about Planet X.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Sumerian text said
Zacharia Sitchin deciphered.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Talk about a Planet X system.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
They talk about Nibiru.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's scattered
throughout all of those texts.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It is.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It's been a topic that
mainstream science tries

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:84%
to pinpoint to say that
it's misinformation,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:18.991 align:middle line:90%
but it's actually not.

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or misinterpretation.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.573 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Or misinterpretation.

00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at these
texts like the Atrahasis

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:84%
and some of these that explain
the cosmological origins of how

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Earth came to be, it talks
about how this rogue planet

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:84%
gets sucked in by the
gravitational pull

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
of the outer planets
and eventually comes

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.800 align:middle line:84%
into a collision with
our primitive Earth,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:90%
called Tiamat at that point.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Now not Planet X hitting us,
but one of the moons of Planet X

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
hits us so strong that
whacks planet Earth

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and spews out this debris that
we now call the asteroid belt

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and moves us into a new orbit.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.387 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And maybe our own moon.

00:04:55.387 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Possibly.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even the Bible
calls the asteroid belt

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:90%
the hammered out bracelet.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you mix
science with Sitchin's work--

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:84%
ancient tablets
again, and texts--

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:90%
there's a correlation.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so exciting.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It is.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, mainstream
science is still

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.046 align:middle line:84%
struggling with this,
George, and that's

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
part of what we're going
to talk about today.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But Zacharia Sitchin
started with,

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
the idea that there's
another planet connected

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:90%
to our human evolution.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Now he goes very far
in this topic, again,

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.616 align:middle line:84%
based on Sumerian evidence,
tablets and texts.

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But he goes on a limb
to say that there

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.659 align:middle line:84%
is another race connected to
us that we called ancient gods.

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And they come from this
other planet that's

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:90%
a part of our solar system.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So just from that alone,
that's a very heavy statement.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So to use science to try to
confirm any type of topic

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.287 align:middle line:84%
like that, we're getting
into the next level for sure.

00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, if you look
at Genesis in the Bible

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and compare it to
the work of Sitchin,

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and just change things a little
bit, it really makes sense.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
He talks about inhabitants
from this planet, Nibiru,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
this extra planet
called the Annunaki

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that came here to
search for gold

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:84%
because they needed to
protect their atmosphere

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:90%
and sprinkle gold dust up there.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But they needed workers
to pull out the gold,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
so they created
us, human beings.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Now if you then tie
that into Genesis,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
the creation, fallen angels,
things that came down here,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.636 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve created,
it makes a lot of sense.

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It really
does, George, and you're

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
very accurate in
your knowledge there,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
of course, because when we look
at the Hebrew version and then

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:84%
the English version of the
King James New Testament,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
both of them are just
derivatives of these Sumerian

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.669 align:middle line:90%
tales.

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of that
information that

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
talks about in the Sumerian
form, where the Annunaki came

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:84%
here and wanted to create
a race in their image

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and after their likeness to
mine this gold that they were

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:84%
finding in Southern Africa to
use for their own purposes,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
it's a very
interesting correlation

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can look at a
lot of the Biblical tales

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and see that there's
an earlier version.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:10%
More specifically, some of
these tablets like the Epic

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:10%
of Gilgamesh, or my favorite
one is the Atrahasis.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we've all
heard of the Biblical tales,

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
the condensed version where
God created everything

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:90%
in seven days.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to
note that the Sumerians,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
for instance, have seven
tablets of creation.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's a set of 13.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a more expanded view.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
But all those tales
in the Bible we

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%
can find in an earlier Akkadian,
or actually Sumerian version,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:90%
in a Sumerian script.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So wow, it raises
a lot of questions.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you think
the information came

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
to the ancients, where
they could put them

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.120 align:middle line:90%
in these tablet forms?

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Now that's getting
into some good questions.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Modern scholars today will look
at ancient Sumer, Mesopotamia,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.222 align:middle line:90%
today's Southern Iraq.

00:07:59.222 --> 00:08:00.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cradle of civilization.

00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:02.554 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Cradle of
civilization, that's right.

00:08:02.554 --> 00:08:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Over 101 firsts come out of this
area for agriculture, writing,

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:84%
kingship, systems of laws and
judges and things like that,

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:90%
astronomy.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So the Sumerian
evidence is interesting

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
precursor civilization

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that they can connect
to them to say

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:84%
that they were influenced
by these people

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.805 align:middle line:90%
and they got the knowledge.

00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
They literally just pop up
with all of these firsts.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So that really
raises the question

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.622 align:middle line:84%
as to who were the influencers
to the Sumerian culture?

00:08:30.622 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who taught them?

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:90%
Who told them?

are starting to predate
mainstream science.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Looking at just Sumer
and ancient Iraq,

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
now we're finding
sites like Gobekli Tepe

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and Bada Valley in
Indonesia, and even

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Easter Island, some of
these sites like Rapa Nui.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
We see that there is
a much older framework

of context for
civilizations to have

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:90%
existed before written time.

Some of them they
call dwarf planets.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:10%
That's what they're
calling this one.

00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:10%
So we're over here.

We keep finding all these
extra solar planets out there

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
that are smaller bodies not
quite the size of a planet

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that was talked about
by Zacharia Sitchin,

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:84%

But what's really
interesting to note, George,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:84%
is that as you've said,
over the last 20 years

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
we've started to notice and
be aware of these influences,

And all the evidence for us to
continue to look at this topic

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:90%
is mounting.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%

it's not a binary star system,

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
a burned out star that was
a companion to our sun?

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Most scientists are
beginning to say now

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.267 align:middle line:84%
that almost every
star has a companion.

>>NOORY: We apparently
don't, unless it's this.

00:11:49.894 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well,
that's the thing,

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
is that there is quite
a bit of evidence

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
mounting to suggest
that most solar systems

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:84%
external from Mars
are binary in nature.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible that
we are a binary system.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But our second sun is
either a brown dwarf

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:84%
or it's a star system that we
haven't quite yet identified.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
But all the evidence,
George, shows us

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
happening to the bodies that

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
are in space, even the
orbiters we send out there.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
The plane of the solar

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So right now we're
looking for another planet,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.071 align:middle line:84%
saying there must be something
in the southern region causing

00:12:32.071 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:90%
this pull.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:90%
But what if it's not a planet?

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
What if it's actually
another star system

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.625 align:middle line:84%
that's affecting us and sending
these massive gravity waves?

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that we're
still trying to figure out.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.174 align:middle line:90%

that's a good question.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.115 align:middle line:84%
The best candidate as of now is
possibly the star system Sirius

00:12:51.115 --> 00:12:54.081 align:middle line:84%
A and B. It seems to be
in the close proximity--

00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out that far, though.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.220 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTELL: Out that
far, but close enough so

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:10%
that there seems to be some
correlation in that we might

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:10%
have some type of a companion
system like a Sirius A and B

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:10%
that we're traveling around.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always necessarily
have to be another star.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:84%
It could be a cluster
system like Sirius A and B.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:84%
If it's a star and
it's burned out,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.510 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
happened to it?

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if our universe
is 14 billion years old,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
if our solar system is
4.5 billion years old,

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and they say that
the star, our sun,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to last what,
another 5 billion years, maybe,

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:90%
what happened to this one?

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.893 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, we're talking
about a time scale that's

00:13:34.893 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:90%
extremely large, obviously.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the idea
of different masses of planets,

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:84%
brown dwarfs, any
type of thing that's

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:84%
a Jupiter-sized planet and
larger, these large gas giants,

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.400 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand
that it is possible

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that we could have
some type of failed sun

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
that's billions of years
older than our current sun

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't have the
type of heat or size

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:90%
for us to easily detect.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But all the influence
suggests that there's

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:90%
been a large amount of debris.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Even someone named Dr. Richard
Mueller has been looking

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
at the idea that possibly
for millions of years,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
this Oort cloud beyond Pluto,
we send things like asteroids

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and various things that
are in this orbit, .

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
They send us to bring into the
inner part of the solar system

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and so there's the
possible thought

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.616 align:middle line:84%
that the debris
and the things that

00:14:25.616 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
keep coming back into the inner
part of the solar system, there

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:84%
must be something out there
that things are looping around.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Even a Planet X
would probably need--

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.779 align:middle line:84%
if it's on a 3,600-year
elliptical orbit,

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:84%
what's out there that's
causing it to loop back around?

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of a second sun
starts to fill that question.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The possibility
of these two suns,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.740 align:middle line:84%
do they affect the civilizations
here on the planet?

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: If we are
in a binary system,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.700 align:middle line:84%
all the evidence is
pointing to the fact

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.634 align:middle line:84%
that there are processes
that affect us here on Earth.

00:14:58.634 --> 00:15:00.550 align:middle line:84%
This is a hard thing for
people to understand.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But there are two smaller
astronomical processes

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:90%
that you can easily understand.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Cycle one is the Earth
is spinning on its axis,

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and while it does that
it causes day and night.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize it, but
when it gets dark out,

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
we lose consciousness
and go to sleep.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
All the plants quietly
close and go to sleep.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Now cycle number
two is the Earth

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.126 align:middle line:90%
is orbiting around the sun.

00:15:23.126 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Again, we don't take
much note to this,

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.700 align:middle line:84%
but we realize that
because of that,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:90%
seasons change, animals migrate.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.880 align:middle line:84%
All the ancients said that
there's a third cycle, because

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:84%
of this binary orbit,
that causes a rise

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.954 align:middle line:90%
and fall of civilization.

00:15:36.954 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
This is a much
harder cycle for us

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:84%
to understand because
it's 24,000 years.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But as a little analogy,
there's an insect

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.705 align:middle line:84%
that lives here on Earth
that only lives for 24 hours.

00:15:47.705 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Its whole life
cycle is 24 hours.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hate to be that insect.

00:15:50.413 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: The mayfly.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So as a joke, if a mayfly
is sitting on a branch

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and another mayfly
comes up and says,

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've heard of this
thing called the sun or wind,

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
but I don't see it,
and they both die,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean that the
sun and the wind don't exist.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.902 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't have a lifespan
long enough to understand it.

00:16:06.902 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
going through right now

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
with understanding this third
cycle of time, this lost cycle,

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:84%
is that it does affect us, but
a much larger cycle of change.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's there.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It is there.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.265 align:middle line:84%
And over 30 ancient
cultures tracked it.

00:16:20.265 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, the
Kepler Space Telescope

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
continues to look and
find other planets.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But in our solar system, other
than the small planetoids,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
has modern science
found the big one?

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It hasn't
found it yet, George.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.893 align:middle line:84%
But as I stated earlier,
what's really interesting

00:16:35.893 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
is that all the
objects we're finding

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:42.240 align:middle line:84%
seem to be on a tilted plane
into the southern atmosphere.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's being
affected out there,

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:84%
the orbits of planets, even
some of these newer ones

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
that we're finding, seem
to have some anomalous pull

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.472 align:middle line:84%
into the southern region
which denotes that that's not

00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:90%
what we're looking for.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not Biden, Sedna, Quaoar.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
There's something much larger
still influencing this pull.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are you
headed with these theories?

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
the most palatable?

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, the
most palatable for me,

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:84%
George, is again, looking
at the latest sciences

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
starting to uncover.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And up till now, the
greatest influence

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:84%
for a gravitational anomaly,
some perturbation that's

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:84%
pulling on the planets,
would be another large body,

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:90%
some large planet.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.160 align:middle line:84%
That's what they've been
looking for, Planet X.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But my thought is that,
based on some of the things

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing, there's been a
lot of new research showing

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:90%
that gravity waves exist.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Somehow these black holes are
actually binary in nature,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and they come to a point where
they expand and then collapse

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:90%
into each other.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And they've found that they're
creating these massive gravity

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
waves that literally
distort space time.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So my thought is that while
we're still currently looking

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
for a Planet X, science
is going to shift

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:84%
this view with the latest model
of gravity waves and things

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:84%
that we're learning, to maybe
look for something much larger

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
than a planet, possibly another
star system that's causing

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:90%
this gravitational influence.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Kepler Space
Telescope, of course,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
has found a planet
orbiting two suns.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
- Multiple star systems, people
looking up at multiple sunsets

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and so on, is a familiar
theme from science fiction.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But this is the first time that
it has become science fact.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So in some sense, that
"Star Wars" sunset

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:84%
on Tatooine that Luke Skywalker
saw has become a possibility.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:84%
In some sense, the
galaxy far, far away

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:90%
has become our own galaxy now.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it seems
pretty standard

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:84%
that there are multiple
star systems out there.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It's great
how popular media

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
has started to influence
our understandings.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:84%
That scene, obviously,
in "Star Wars'" epic

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.620 align:middle line:90%
where we see two suns.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're
close together.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: They
are close together.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And that correlates to another
topic, which we'll discuss,

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:84%
which is the dark ages
versus the Golden Age,

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and is there some relation
to us having two suns,

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.630 align:middle line:84%
the two suns being
at their closest,

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:84%
we seem to be in
this Golden Age.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Suns at their
farthest point, we go

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.240 align:middle line:84%
into this type of dark
ages like "Game of Thrones"

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:90%
type thing that we see.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of the two
suns being depicted in media

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
is very interesting and
probably very accurate

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
when we understand that there is
a lot of research to show that

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
over 30 ancient cultures
believed in the idea of two

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:84%
suns and actually had quite
a bit of research that

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:90%
was uncovered.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
There was a book written called
"Hamlet's Mill" by an MIT

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:84%
professor in 1969 looking into
why over 30 ancient cultures

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
were watching the heavens,
and made these references

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.510 align:middle line:90%
to a binary star system.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's more
exciting and romantic?

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Another planet in the solar
system that may be inhabited

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.302 align:middle line:90%
or a burned out star?

00:19:57.302 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, you know,
and again, the other thing

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.051 align:middle line:84%
I'd throw out there
is maybe not even

00:20:01.051 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
a burned out star, but maybe
another active star system.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
We look at some of these
ancient cultures that are still

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
off the radar from technology,
like the Dogon tribe in Africa,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're accurately
depicting star systems

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:84%
like Orion and specifically
Sirius A and B.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before
science knew about it.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Exactly.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can't even really
see this with the naked eye.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
You need math to
crunch the numbers

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and understand
these correlations.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So some of these cultures
having this knowledge

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
really raises questions as
to who bequeathed it to them.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's your gut tell
you about our solar system?

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.993 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: My gut sense
is that there's just

00:20:35.993 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
a larger cycle of time that
has been put in place here

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, and we're still
trying to understand it.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan calendar
got a lot of attention

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:84%
when they ended in
2012 and people thought

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:90%
it was the end of the world.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:90%
But it was the ending of an age.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.616 align:middle line:90%
And we go through cyclical ages.

00:20:52.616 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
it's very possible

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.470 align:middle line:84%
that through this idea
of a binary star system,

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:84%
we're going to realize that time
might be cyclical in nature,

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's been going much
further back than we currently

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During the 2012
episode with the Mayans,

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.370 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people thought,
this is the end of the world.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:90%
It's all over.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Why did some
scholars think that?

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It's just
a misinterpretation

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.689 align:middle line:90%
of the knowledge.

00:21:19.689 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of great
researchers like John Major

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Jenkins, who actually
lives in these cultures

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and understands at a
more esoteric level.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the end of time,
it's just the end of an age.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
As I said, over 30
ancient cultures

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
watched this progression
as we traveled

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:84%
through these different zodiacal
symbols that we call an age.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when we had the
ending of the last age,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
the age of Pisces, crossing
over into the Age of Aquarius,

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:84%
a lot of modern scholars, not
understanding this progression

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:84%
of time, what we call today the
procession of the equinoxes,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
they misinterpret
it and say, wow,

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans are predicting
the end of time.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not the end of time.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:90%
It's like a clock.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just the ending of this
hour, the ending of this age.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: End of an era.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's correct.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So the person watching
the program right now,

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Jason, where we're
talking about another star

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:84%
system or another planet,
is probably saying,

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
so really, what's
the difference?

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:90%
How does that affect me?

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So if we have another
star in our solar system,

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:90%
what does that do?

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Could that be a
catastrophe down the line?

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Does that cause these strange
weather anomalies we're having?

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, no one really
knows for certain, George.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know
is that science today

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:84%
is tracking something called
the procession of the equinoxes.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And explain that.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.415 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Of course.

00:22:38.415 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:10%
It's a modern term that says
that every 72 years, our North

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:10%
Star degrades by
about one degree

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.860 align:middle line:10%
so that around every 2,000
years, our North Star

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:10%
is literally pointing at
a new location in space.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:10%
Now the ancients used this
to track the constellations

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:10%
that we go through.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They divided the
heavens into 12 parts,

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:90%
the 12 houses of the zodiac.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So what's really
interesting to note

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.560 align:middle line:84%
is that for thousands of years,
ancient cultures have been

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
watching the progression
of these ages,

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:84%
where we just passed out of the
age of Pisces, as an example.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.334 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
into Aquarius now?

00:23:18.334 --> 00:23:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well,
that's the thing,

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.200 align:middle line:84%
is that if we look at it from
an astronomical standpoint,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:84%
the age of Pisces ended
right around 2012.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Now Pisces, again, is the
symbol of a fish, which is also

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:84%
very symbolic to the age we
just left, which is very heavy

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:90%
and the focus of Jesus.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
You'll see people driving around
and they have a little fish

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:90%
on the back of their car.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:84%
What they don't realize
is that's actually

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:90%
a much older symbol than Christ.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:84%
It's an astronomical symbol
for the age of Pisces.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus being the age
of Pisces, the fish,

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.432 align:middle line:84%
2012 was the kind of crossover
into the galactic plane

00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:53.890 align:middle line:84%
where the Mayans
were watching this

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:55.195 align:middle line:90%
and said that age has ended--

00:23:55.195 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's gone.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.528 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Now
we're into Aquarius.

00:23:57.528 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:84%
People can even sort of feel
a shift about their religion

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and their ideas of
what we believe in

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:84%
to have more of
an expanded view,

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and possibly more
open minded to things.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about some of the things

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients
worked on and what they

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.600 align:middle line:90%
did in terms of their research.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have equipment,
they didn't have telescopes,

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:90%
they didn't have computers.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Yet they had the
incredible ability

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
constellations,

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
understand the
sciences of the stars.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.136 align:middle line:90%
How did they do that?

00:24:29.136 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know,
ancient man didn't

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:84%
have the technological
layer that we

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:84%
do to blind them at night
with lights and city

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:90%
lights and various things.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:84%
They'd go out every
night and see just

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.790 align:middle line:90%
this wonderful, immaculate sky.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And at the basic answer,
humans could go out every day

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:84%
just as the sun is rising,
the time of heliacal rising

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:90%
is what it's called.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:10%
And as the sun's coming
up, whatever constellation

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:10%
the sun is rising in front
of would allow you to know,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:10%
oh, I'm in the Age of
Pisces, the Age of Taurus,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:10%
the Age of Aquarius.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So they used some
pretty simple things

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.520 align:middle line:84%
to actually know where they
were in this cycle of time.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:84%
But what raises the eyebrows,
George, is the monuments

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.390 align:middle line:84%
they built, all over the
world, every culture.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have been this lost
language written in astronomy,

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
where they were
monitoring the heavens

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and built structures that
have alignments that repeat.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And we still don't
understand today

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:84%
why they did that, but they
put a great amount of effort

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:84%
into making these markers
in time, which we're now

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
just starting to understand
and see that even some

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
of the great ancient
cultures like Egypt,

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
we know that there's
an area called

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:90%
the Dendera, these crypts.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And on the ceiling is
this huge wall relief

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:84%
where the Egyptians are pretty
much depicting the sky of Egypt

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.095 align:middle line:90%
at 8,000 BC.

00:25:51.095 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's accurate.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: And it's
extremely accurate.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So if they built the
pyramids at 2,500 BC,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.750 align:middle line:84%
why are they referencing
constellations at 8,000 BC?

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Now either they're a
much older culture,

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.987 align:middle line:84%
or again, they're
monitoring a system of time

00:26:05.987 --> 00:26:08.070 align:middle line:84%
which we're still trying
to come up to speed with.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
the Age of Aquarius

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:84%
mean to us today, the fact
that we're now into that?

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.774 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:26:13.774 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think the
Age of Aquarius, again,

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.310 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
past track record,

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:90%
is a time of great change.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a time when
things are starting

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:90%
to be more and more questioned.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Science seems to
be outweighing some

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
of the traditional
theories of what's

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
influenced on maybe more of a
spiritual or religious plane.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So the Age of
Aquarius in the past

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
was always kind of the dawning
of enlightenment, the time when

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
we're just starting
to leave the dark ages

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and come into a new,
hopefully Golden Age.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking thousands of
years for this to take place.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient cultures
looking at this cycle,

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.590 align:middle line:84%
it's a 12,000-year cycle
to go into the Golden Age,

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and then a 12,000-year cycle
descending out of the Golden

00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Age.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very, very
long process for us

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:90%
to go through these changes.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there's another
star system out there somewhere,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:84%
what does that mean to us in
terms of helping this planet

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.650 align:middle line:90%
or anything else?

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, from the
research that we've been

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.490 align:middle line:84%
looking at, George, if there is
a correlation with the binary

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.640 align:middle line:84%
orbit affecting the rise and
fall of civilization here

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.370 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, what we've
seen in the past is--

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.694 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Catastrophes too?

00:27:27.694 --> 00:27:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Catastrophes too.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a good interjection.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:84%
The last time we
were in a golden age

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:84%
was probably about
10,000 years ago.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we see
these great monuments

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:84%
like Giza, and even Gobekli Tepe
just recently being uncovered.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.490 align:middle line:84%
But Giza, as an example, we
see great feats of architecture

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:84%
in the last Golden Age,
maybe 10,000 years ago.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.340 align:middle line:84%
What we also see is some
type of great cataclysm,

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:84%
meaning something happened
around the 10,000-year mark

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:57.810 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:58.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Atlantis.

00:27:58.675 --> 00:28:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Some great
flood, something.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We even see that the inner
walls that the Sphinx have

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:90%
been inundated with water.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Last time it was raining
in Giza, 10,000 years.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's an interesting
thing to note

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
that if this correlation
of the idea that we

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:84%
go into a golden age and into
a Dark Age, the last Golden Age

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
we were in, all the great
monuments around the Earth

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:26.220 align:middle line:84%
seemed to align to this far
off date in the past of 10,000

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.900 align:middle line:84%
years plus for the possible when
that great race was building

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.757 align:middle line:84%
and doing that type
of architecture.

00:28:32.757 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're still kind of
disconnected from that time

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.548 align:middle line:84%
and trying to catch
up to what they knew.

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do we stand
with great researchers?

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Are they still out there
doing what they do,

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.030 align:middle line:84%
or do we need to get more
younger people in-- like you--

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.839 align:middle line:84%
into the business
to keep this going?

00:28:46.839 --> 00:28:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, I
think there's definitely

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of room for more minds
to look at these topics.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting to note
that over the last 20

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.650 align:middle line:84%
years, the amount of research
that we've been uncovering

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:84%
looking at the ancient
sites, it starts

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.990 align:middle line:90%
to raise a lot of questions.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And looking into the
past, this isn't actually

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.770 align:middle line:90%
a new topic, George.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
This idea of a great
cycle of time, Plato

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:90%
called it the great year.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ancient seers
and rishis and Vedic texts

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and some of these things
talk about this idea

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:90%
of this binary solar system.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So there is a great
deal of knowledge

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.967 align:middle line:84%
that comes from even
more ancient sources.

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But we're still trying to
understand and interpret

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:34.530 align:middle line:84%
the data that they put forth
even thousands of years ago.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On our Gaia show,
which is called "Deep Space",

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
which is one of our programs,
researcher Billy Carson

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:90%
talks about the Kali Yuga.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at that and
have you explain it after.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.844 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Perfect example.

00:29:47.844 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:90%
- I really believe in the Yugas.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:84%
You actually go through
a cycle of 27,000 years

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:84%
where mankind goes
through the Bronze Age

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and kind of gradually moves
back up to the Golden Age again.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a process of basically
going back and starting over.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
These things happen
from cataclysms.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And everything is cyclical.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.500 align:middle line:10%
When a cataclysm
happens, no matter

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:10%
how far technologically
advanced you are,

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:10%
you will get knocked back down.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I think this is why you
see the big rush now

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:90%
to go to Mars by private space.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:84%
You see Elon Musk
and SpaceX talking

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:84%
about taking 80,000 people
to Mars on a one way trip.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.500 align:middle line:90%
They're not coming back.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.339 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy's been on
"Beyond Belief" before.

00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Now what does Kali Yuga mean?

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So the ancient Vedic,
and some of these languages

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that come from
Hindu and such, they

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
have the same idea of
this divisional heaven

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.530 align:middle line:90%
into 12 parts.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they called
it the Kali Yuga,

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and they had various terms,
just like Plato's Great Year.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:84%
He had the Iron Age, the
Bronze Age, the Silver Age,

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and the Golden Age.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So even further back in time
we go to these Vedic texts,

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and they have the Kali Yuga,
Dvapara Yuga, and all the ones

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.580 align:middle line:84%
going up into the Golden Age,
just the same cycle of time,

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.337 align:middle line:84%
but using different
terms to describe them.

00:31:10.337 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:84%
One thing that's
interesting in that video--

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:84%
you'll note that Billy mentions
the frame of 27,000 years--

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:84%
to note that our current
understanding of precession,

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.380 align:middle line:84%
they call it a lunisolar
wobble which is affecting us

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.440 align:middle line:90%
based on the moon's movement.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the mainstream
idea is that there's--

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
cycle, isn't it?

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.431 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, that's
the mainstream idea

00:31:31.431 --> 00:31:33.450 align:middle line:84%
today is that it's
caused by our moon.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But the research that
we're putting forth,

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
looking at a binary system,
would actually say that this

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:84%
model is more like
24,000-year cycle.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And that would be because if you
think about two bodies orbiting

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.610 align:middle line:84%
each other, they kind of
speed up and then slow down.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the mean
average, as they're

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:84%
traveling through
space, takes our ages

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.500 align:middle line:84%
to be around just a
little over 2,000 years

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:84%
so that we have
12 constellations.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And you travel through each
one of those every 2,000 years.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
It's roughly a
24,000-year cycle.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the
binary system causing

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.470 align:middle line:84%
catastrophes on this planet,
like the flood of Noah,

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Like Atlantis sinking?

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.500 align:middle line:84%
You made reference to that,
but do we know for sure?

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: We don't
know for sure,

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.850 align:middle line:84%
but there does seem to be a
correlation between the rise

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and fall of civilization
here on Earth

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.327 align:middle line:84%
and the orbit of these
two suns in the sense

00:32:27.327 --> 00:32:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that we've been able
to plot that when

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.860 align:middle line:84%
the planets, at their farthest
point, when the suns are

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.700 align:middle line:84%
at their farthest point,
Earth seems to be in something

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.350 align:middle line:84%
called the Dark Ages, where
we're very much materialistic,

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:90%
very low in spirituality.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.239 align:middle line:84%
But then as these suns get
to their closest point--

00:32:44.239 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually see
some of these references

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in texts in ancient cultures
depicting two suns as to say

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:90%
that we are in our Golden Age.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So there might be some
correlation, George,

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that when the suns are
at their closest point,

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:90%
there is this additional energy.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about how
people feel when they go out

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.710 align:middle line:84%
in the sunshine on a nice
summer day, full of energy

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and these things that
propel us to feel good.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Sun goes away, you get
tired, you go to sleep.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So what if two suns
affect us in some way

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.560 align:middle line:90%
that we just don't understand?

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if it's a
yin and yang type thing?

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Makes you feel good,
makes you feel bad.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.038 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Well, it could be.

00:33:20.038 --> 00:33:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But it is very possible that
the orbits of these two suns,

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and the correlation of them
when they're closest to us, we

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.331 align:middle line:84%
are in some type
of a Golden Age.

00:33:28.331 --> 00:33:29.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking
of Golden Ages,

00:33:29.705 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:84%
a 1969 book called "Hamlet's
Mill" dealt with some

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.885 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient cultures.

00:33:35.885 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Right, which
is really interesting

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to see that there is evidence,
even going into our past,

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.874 align:middle line:84%
that we've been looking
into these topics.

00:33:42.874 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
very interesting book

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.580 align:middle line:84%
called "Hamlet's
Mill" written in 1969

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.555 align:middle line:90%
by a couple of MIT professors.

00:33:48.555 --> 00:33:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
was they were looking

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.210 align:middle line:84%
at all the ancient cultures
and their references

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:84%
to these astronomical
symbols and things that

00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:84%
seemed to show using
symbology of the 12 houses

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.332 align:middle line:90%
of the zodiac to denote change.

00:34:03.332 --> 00:34:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Many of these scenes you
might see of someone slaying

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:84%
a bull, or someone having fish,
or bucket of water pouring out.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it turns out that these
are all symbolic references

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.739 align:middle line:84%
to this idea that the ancients
were tracking this larger

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:19.940 align:middle line:90%
cycle of time.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're all aware that
we went through these ages,

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and then these ages brought
great change, sometimes good

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.770 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes bad.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I am fascinated
with the thought

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:35.630 align:middle line:84%
of ancient technology, what
they had, how they had it.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Are you convinced that
some of the ancients, maybe

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians, had
incredible technology?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: 100%, George.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
research that we've

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.856 align:middle line:84%
been doing through shows
like "Ancient Aliens"

00:34:45.856 --> 00:34:49.639 align:middle line:84%
and others shows that there
is some type of a world energy

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:90%
grid.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.000 align:middle line:84%
All these monuments, especially
Giza, the three Great Pyramids,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
they're built and
put geodetically

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.890 align:middle line:84%
on the globe to be connected
in some way that in the past--

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:84%
we don't understand
how or when--

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:84%
they seemed to have been
sharing a subtle energy.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't know
why or what it's for.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But one of the theories that
seems to resonate with me

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:84%
is that if we go into
the state of a Golden Age

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and there's this natural sense
of enlightenment that just

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:84%
drives us to feel good
and evolve naturally,

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.550 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do everything we
can to hang on to that energy.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible that a
lot of these great monuments

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
were built to
harness this energy,

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.720 align:middle line:84%
meaning as we're coming
out of the Golden Age

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and this energy is diminishing,
they built monuments

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:84%
to somehow harness
this energy and hold

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.690 align:middle line:90%
onto it as long as they can.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's just one example.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.160 align:middle line:84%
What we see from
ancient technology

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.850 align:middle line:84%
are physical pieces
around the globe, again,

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Giza being a great
example, where

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.200 align:middle line:90%
were the pyramids really a tomb?

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Or as Christopher Dunn --

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A power source.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's right.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Tell me about
the world energy grid.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.210 align:middle line:84%
What's its purpose
and who built it?

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Most scholars
today will accept the idea

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.450 align:middle line:84%
that there was some type of
subtle energy being distributed

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.160 align:middle line:84%
globally by all these
great monuments placed

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.370 align:middle line:90%
at geodetic points.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.530 align:middle line:84%
We know for a fact
that they exist.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:90%
The question is who built that?

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Now even in the last
Golden Age, there

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:21.080 align:middle line:84%
must have been some knowledge
given to these people to say,

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.624 align:middle line:84%
ah, we need to build
these monuments.

00:36:22.624 --> 00:36:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they just
didn't develop it on their own.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.039 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: That's right.

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:27.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's a progression
of time that's

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.980 align:middle line:84%
going back thousands
and thousands of years

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.640 align:middle line:84%
to realize that when we were
in the last Golden Age, maybe

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
we had some understanding
that wow, we

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.280 align:middle line:84%
need to build these monuments
to harness this energy.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.155 align:middle line:84%
But it goes back even
farther than them.

00:36:41.155 --> 00:36:44.890 align:middle line:84%
There must have been previous
civilizations that were aware

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:48.670 align:middle line:84%
of this cycle and the need
to start to do something

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:84%
to possibly build
this world energy grid

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.710 align:middle line:84%
so that in the next cycle,
their ancestors would

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:57.700 align:middle line:84%
pick up the work and be able to
further harness and understand.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what's happening
right now, George.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Just as you and I
take and understand,

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.000 align:middle line:84%
we are now rebuilding
and picking up

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that torch of knowledge to
bring light onto this topic.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I assume the
grid is still around.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.081 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: It is still
there, and there are still

00:37:11.081 --> 00:37:13.990 align:middle line:84%
subtle energy
gravitational anomalies

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and things at a lot of
these megalithic sites.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
understand and interpret

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.080 align:middle line:90%
why that effect is there.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about
the ancient Indians

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.350 align:middle line:90%
talking about flying machines?

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.530 align:middle line:90%
The Vimanas, for example?

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:27.710 align:middle line:90%
What the heck were they?

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:84%
You have these Indian gods,
Krishna and various other ones,

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.170 align:middle line:84%
that are having battles
with each other,

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and sites like Dwarka
off the coast of India,

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.280 align:middle line:84%
literally a submerged city
that must have existed

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.254 align:middle line:90%
above the surface at one time.

00:37:44.254 --> 00:37:45.670 align:middle line:84%
But we have these
great tales that

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:49.150 align:middle line:84%
come from the Mahabharata
and various Vedic texts,

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:51.400 align:middle line:90%
some of them 10,000 years.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And they show Vimana and
craft aerial battles,

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.600 align:middle line:84%
magnificent weapons being
used that sound like--

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nukes.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Nuclear weapons.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was those ancient
stories of nuclear explosions

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that got Robert Oppenheimer,
our father of the atomic bomb,

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.410 align:middle line:90%
to start thinking about this.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: You're right.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And he even depicted
the Indian god Shiva,

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:16.420 align:middle line:84%
which is all about
you have to destroy

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.540 align:middle line:90%
before you can recreate.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.057 align:middle line:84%
Even the Large Hadron Collider
has the god Shiva as its idol.

00:38:23.057 --> 00:38:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure, right?

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: We have
to destroy to be

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.580 align:middle line:84%
able to find these particles
that we're now just starting

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.690 align:middle line:90%
to discover.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cairo means Mars.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be an
Earth-Mars connection.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Yes.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you're
getting into some fun

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:42.370 align:middle line:84%
topics that originally sparked
my interest into all of these.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:46.420 align:middle line:84%
We look at stuff on
Mars, Cydonia and such,

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:84%
which we can talk
about, but then

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.440 align:middle line:84%
realize that there's monuments
here all over the Earth

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that we still don't
have answers for.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, when we look
at Mars, look at Cydonia,

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.600 align:middle line:84%
it starts to raise
a lot of questions

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.720 align:middle line:84%
about the origins of
who could possibly

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.860 align:middle line:84%
have been on Mars
tens of thousands,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.480 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands
of years ago?

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
happened to them?

00:39:07.938 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: And to have built
monuments that seem to reflect

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.650 align:middle line:84%
the same things
that we have here--

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:15.260 align:middle line:84%
possibly as you mentioned
in Cairo, in Egypt--

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:19.340 align:middle line:84%
a large Sphinx-like
object, three pyramids,

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.220 align:middle line:84%
some of these things, again,
that we see in Cydonia,

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.820 align:middle line:84%
this large face that does
have lion-type characteristics

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.960 align:middle line:90%
under further analysis.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And eyeballs
and everything else.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:29.996 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: It's a face.

00:39:29.996 --> 00:39:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So it really does raise a
lot of questions, George,

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:84%
as to not only why those
monuments are on Mars,

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.530 align:middle line:90%
but who built them.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, back in
2015, Dr. John Brandenburg

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.290 align:middle line:84%
talked about
Cydonia, that region,

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.620 align:middle line:90%
with compelling evidence.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.700 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.700 align:middle line:90%
- What have we got here?

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:51.350 align:middle line:10%
Well, this looks like a
carved face similar to what

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:10%
was carved by the Olmecs.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:57.800 align:middle line:10%
There's a fascinating parallel
through this of connection

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.300 align:middle line:10%
with old Mexico.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So Mexicanos must go
to Mars because they

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.130 align:middle line:84%
will understand this
place better, better

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.410 align:middle line:90%
than most Americanos.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:13.440 align:middle line:10%
Most gringos will
not understand Mars.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:10%
But the Mexicanos, they
will, because it looks

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.280 align:middle line:10%
like this is the Olmec heads.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.780 align:middle line:10%
By the way, you'll
notice one thing.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:20.905 align:middle line:10%
It's called a frame corner.

00:40:20.905 --> 00:40:24.060 align:middle line:10%
Also head ornaments,
those are all present.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:10%
The stuff on Mars
is pretty beat up.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:31.680 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is probably
100 million years old.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.770 align:middle line:10%
Even on Mars there is erosion.

That's amazing.

But it's really, I
think, compelling, Jason,

00:40:42.952 --> 00:40:43.910 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see that.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:46.130 align:middle line:84%

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:50.040 align:middle line:84%
we just looked at in Cydonia,

00:41:07.155 --> 00:41:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.435 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Who knows?

00:41:08.435 --> 00:41:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But the face on
Mars seems to be,

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:14.726 align:middle line:84%
as our technology in imaging
improves, the face degrades.

00:41:14.726 --> 00:41:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the face is?

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.599 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I think the face
is a monument of some lost

00:41:18.599 --> 00:41:22.380 align:middle line:84%
civilization that was connected
to us, meaning the face used

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.530 align:middle line:84%
to be right on the
equator of Mars.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Someone flying into our
solar system, that's

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:31.006 align:middle line:84%
a pretty recognizable
calling card to say, hi, this

00:41:31.006 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:90%
is what we look like.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.062 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hi, there.

00:41:32.062 --> 00:41:32.430 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:36.312 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we Martians?

00:41:36.312 --> 00:41:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: I would
hope so, George.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the evidence
points to the fact

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.810 align:middle line:84%
that there's some lost
connection for us in space,

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it be gods, aliens, or
something that we can't quite

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.300 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.430 align:middle line:84%
We all have that
drive to reconnect.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Even the whole
process of death seems

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.700 align:middle line:84%
to show us going up or
into a tunnel of light.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So I would sure hope that
human civilization has

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.910 align:middle line:84%
extended beyond Earth, and
my gut tells me that it has.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've told so
many scientists, Jason,

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.640 align:middle line:84%
that the primordial soup is
the same in the universe.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.810 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:14.610 align:middle line:84%
The seeds of life that
created us are everywhere.

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:18.300 align:middle line:84%
When you can get the right
mixture of heat and water

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:84%
with the ingredients
that are out there,

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.810 align:middle line:90%
it's going to happen.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And over time, whatever
our life really is--

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that's another show
all by itself--

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.980 align:middle line:84%
something is going to
happen and develop.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's happened on
Mars, Venus, other areas, maybe

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Europa, Jupiter's Moon.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:41.100 align:middle line:84%
But in Mars's situation,
what happened to that planet?

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.480 align:middle line:90%
It had an atmosphere.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It had oceans.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.174 align:middle line:90%
What happened to it?

00:42:45.174 --> 00:42:47.256 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, we don't
really know yet, George.

00:42:47.256 --> 00:42:49.230 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
overriding questions.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:52.890 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned many
planets, not just Mars.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that life could
exist on planet Mars today

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.790 align:middle line:84%
is something that we're
still trying to prove.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's rather unfortunate.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.734 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who is really
interested in this question,

00:43:04.734 --> 00:43:06.150 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
public agencies--

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.790 align:middle line:84%
JPL, Goddard Space Center,
Malin Space Science Systems.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And they all offer their
public archives for you

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.270 align:middle line:90%
to look through their imagery.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Now anyone who's spent
the time to do this--

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Vincent DiPietro,
Greg Molenaar--

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:21.330 align:middle line:84%
way in the past,
found these pyramids.

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Today other researchers
like myself,

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.980 align:middle line:84%
when we look into
the NASA archives,

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.970 align:middle line:84%
you find hundreds of images
showing water standing

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:32.220 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
Mars, algae and what

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:84%
appear to be plant life all
over the surface of Mars.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't this on the news?

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that there's
more than just NASA's presence

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.710 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you see other
agencies and their material

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that they release,
for instance, ISA,

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and they show depictions of
the Gusev Crater in color,

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.340 align:middle line:84%
you see what appears
to be green vegetation.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.606 align:middle line:84%
Now NASA will take a
picture of the Gusev Crater

00:43:55.606 --> 00:43:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's only in
black and white.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looks trees
and stuff like that.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Still looks like
some type of vegetation,

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:03.935 align:middle line:84%
but they're not as
forthcoming with the knowledge

00:44:03.935 --> 00:44:05.310 align:middle line:84%
as you'd hope that
they would be.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:06.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there's
always been talk

00:44:06.935 --> 00:44:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that there's a secret
Mars space program.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Basiago claims
that as a youngster,

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.160 align:middle line:90%
he was beamed aboard--

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.870 align:middle line:90%
now this is far out--

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.260 align:middle line:84%
but that he was beamed aboard
and traveled to Mars and things

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.070 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Corey Goode talks about
this on his program

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia about a
secret space program.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.252 align:middle line:90%
You think that's possible?

00:44:28.252 --> 00:44:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: You, know George--

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's far out.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: I know.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But my personal opinion
is that yes, you know,

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.450 align:middle line:84%
what I like to talk about
in my research and lectures

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:41.370 align:middle line:84%
is physical evidence that I
can hand to you and you decide.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.620 align:middle line:84%
These topics are a
little harder to confirm.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But again, anyone
who digs into these,

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.060 align:middle line:84%
it's been out there
for a long time.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.100 align:middle line:84%
A video made a long
time ago, I think,

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.000 align:middle line:84%
in the 70s, called
"Alternative 3",

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.854 align:middle line:90%
shows literally the Russians--

00:44:54.854 --> 00:44:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a Russian
landing in '62, right?

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:57.600 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.420 align:middle line:10%
1962.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.859 align:middle line:84%
The Russians are landing
on Mars in color,

00:45:00.859 --> 00:45:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and you see something scurrying
off outside the window.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.020 align:middle line:90%
Now it's dramatized.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:05.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
there's enough evidence

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to support the idea
that, yes, we've probably

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.890 align:middle line:84%
been on Mars, the moon,
and maybe other places

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:16.250 align:middle line:90%
for quite a long time.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring
up the idea of life,

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:20.890 align:middle line:84%
you can go anywhere
on our planet

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and lift up a rock or
a leaf, there's life.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Most likely this is
happening ubiquitously

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.660 align:middle line:90%
throughout the solar system.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So on Mars, my gut instinct
is that yes, there's life.

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.581 align:middle line:90%
Is there intelligent life?

00:45:34.581 --> 00:45:35.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the fun question.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if there
is, why keep it a secret?

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.680 align:middle line:84%
To me this would be
one of the greatest

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.090 align:middle line:90%
discoveries of mankind.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:45.000 align:middle line:90%
It does not negate the Bible.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't push you away
from talking about God.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.340 align:middle line:90%
Why would you keep it secret?

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I were
running the country

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and we had a discovery
like this, or if we knew,

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:56.659 align:middle line:90%
I'd go public with it.

00:45:56.659 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: And that's
why we're going

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.158 align:middle line:84%
to vote for you for
president in the next term.

00:46:00.158 --> 00:46:01.158 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never know.

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:03.241 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: You know, George,
it's a good question.

00:46:03.241 --> 00:46:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But all I can do is
look at our track record

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.810 align:middle line:90%
of how we've handled the data.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poorly.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:12.270 align:middle line:84%
NASA's inception in 1959,
hiring a big think tank

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.340 align:middle line:84%
called the Brookings
Institute that

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.930 align:middle line:84%
advised them, look, you're
going to go into space,

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and particulates
and contaminants.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scare the world.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: Right.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And so they put in mandates,
even in the late 50s,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.220 align:middle line:84%
to say that if you
find extraterrestrials,

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.140 align:middle line:84%
if you interact with
them in any way,

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.980 align:middle line:84%
even microparticles of them,
there's contamination issues,

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.390 align:middle line:84%
there's societal,
political, religion.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Things break down.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:36.626 align:middle line:90%
Society breaks down.

00:46:36.626 --> 00:46:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: So we still have
a lot of that in place today.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with you,
it's time for change.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Change is happening.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:84%
NASA is a much
smaller organization

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.630 align:middle line:84%
compared to the entrepreneurial
aspects of what we're

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.690 align:middle line:84%
going to be doing in space,
SpaceX, Richard Branson

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.820 align:middle line:90%
and his Virgin Galactic.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm fairly
optimistic, George.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've always felt it
in my gut that hopefully

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:58.784 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime--

00:46:58.784 --> 00:46:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I could tell.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Oh, it
would really be

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:02.880 align:middle line:84%
nice for that egg to be
cracked open, to realize

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.640 align:middle line:90%
we're not alone.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
exploration will we

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.800 align:middle line:84%
discover on this planet
that will convince us

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.802 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients had incredible
knowledge and high technology?

00:47:14.802 --> 00:47:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: Well, I'll try to
give the short answer to that.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.980 align:middle line:84%
The thing that's
really caught my eye

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.100 align:middle line:84%
is that some of these
Biblical tales around,

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.470 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the
exodus of Egypt,

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:29.460 align:middle line:84%
where the Hebrews were left
to go back to their land,

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.750 align:middle line:84%
we hear terms like Akhenaten,
one of the first pharaohs,

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.130 align:middle line:90%
the term Moses.

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that a
lot of these stories

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.190 align:middle line:84%
are also intertwined
with technology.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:41.150 align:middle line:84%
The idea that the Great
Pyramid wasn't a tomb

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.780 align:middle line:84%
but was possibly some large
energy source being powered

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:46.737 align:middle line:90%
by the Ark of the Covenant.

00:47:46.737 --> 00:47:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
it's a spaceship that

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.980 align:middle line:90%
just hasn't taken off yet?

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.780 align:middle line:90%
All three of them.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: That
would be interesting.

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But we do have a lot of
evidence mounting to the idea

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that, again, a world
energy grid, tests

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:00.110 align:middle line:84%
that I've done with
the idea that they

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:05.057 align:middle line:84%
had even light, electricity
in Egypt, the Dendera bulb.

00:48:05.057 --> 00:48:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Baghdad
battery, remember that?

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTELL: The Baghdad battery.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we extrapolate
even larger out,

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.690 align:middle line:84%
we see that some
of these monuments,

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:13.670 align:middle line:84%
like the actual
Giza pyramids, might

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:16.160 align:middle line:84%
have been powered
by some large energy

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.660 align:middle line:84%
source like the Ark
of the Covenant,

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.927 align:middle line:84%
always emanating rays
and fire and such.

00:48:20.927 --> 00:48:22.760 align:middle line:10%
So if that's the case,
we have to understand

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.820 align:middle line:10%
that there was a much deeper
rooted technology being

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.350 align:middle line:10%
used in the past.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:28.580 align:middle line:10%
We don't understand it yet.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.190 align:middle line:10%
We still think of it as
something of the gods.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, thanks for being
a guest on "Beyond Belief".

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTELL: My pleasure,
George, as always.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One day we'll
get you the answers

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:90%
to these compelling questions.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.460 align:middle line:90%
What did the ancients possess?

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Did they have high technology?

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.990 align:middle line:10%
Are we in a binary star system?

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:47.960 align:middle line:10%
We'll get you the answers one
day here on Beyond Belief".

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
