00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>THERESA BULLARD: Thank you.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.223 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:00:50.223 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:90%
How did you become a physicist?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.020 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
well, I was on my way

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:10%
to try and figure
out what college I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:10%
wanted to go to
for undergraduate

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:10%
and what I wanted to major in.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And while I was on a
road trip at one point,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:84%
driving to different
colleges, I was looking out

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
at the stars at night one
day through the desert,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.238 align:middle line:84%
and as I was looking out at
the stars, I was so inspired.

00:01:13.238 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow, it's
amazing, because when

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:84%
you're in the desert, you can
just see the whole Milky Way.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything, everything.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.365 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And I thought,
oh, what is out there?

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking,
what is out there?

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.782 align:middle line:10%
I want to know what's
out there-- something

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:10%
beyond our mundane little
lives here on Earth

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:10%
because I thought there's
so much more going on.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment, I
had this, oh, that's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:10%
what I'm going to
major in-- astronomy.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.372 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The epiphany
hit you, right?

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, it did.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But then I ended up going
to the University of Denver,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.148 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't have
astronomy as a major,

00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, if you're
going to go to graduate school

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
at some point, then
the most important

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:84%
is you have physics
as a solid foundation,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and so why don't you get
your Bachelor's in physics?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what got me
on the path of physics.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And then they
said, well, you can

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:84%
do astronomy or
astrophysics later when

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:90%
you get to graduate school.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And so things just
kind of led me to it.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I would not have
actually selected it,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:84%
but the university just kept
steering me back into it,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
even though I thought,
I'm not sure I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:84%
want to stay with physics
because, actually, of all

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.682 align:middle line:84%
the subjects, it was the one
I struggled with the most.

00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not easy.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:84%
When you think of what Einstein
had to go through, my gosh.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and also, honestly,
in physics education,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
they train you with
classical physics first,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's the Newtonian
way of thinking

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.263 align:middle line:84%
and that classical and
mechanical way of doing things.

00:02:30.263 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And then later,
they introduce you

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to the quantum physics
and the modern particle

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:90%
high-energy physics stuff.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I always had
a more intuitive sense

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum a
deeper interest in it,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:90%
whereas the classical stuff--

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I was just like, I
don't care about this.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Why do I need to
know this, right?

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I struggled with physics
because it was so oriented

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
towards that classical
indoctrination

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:84%
first before we got into
the interesting stuff.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've kind
of mixed real science

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:90%
with these mystery teachings.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yep.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
an interesting blend.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen for you?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Well, when I
was in graduate school--

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
so I was just really
immersed in physics.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I was
in graduate school,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:84%
it was like 80 hours
of physics a week.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you
were a scientist.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: I was.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I was doing my research.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I was doing my training
and classwork and tests

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and all that kind of stuff,
and I was just immersed in it.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And after about a year of that,
I got really out of balance

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
because 80 hours left brain
only, and I had nothing else.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I was really out
of balance after a year,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and I got kind of
depressed, and I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
was really dissatisfied with how
things were happening in school

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
because I would want to
ask questions like, well,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:84%
what does this
observer effect mean?

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.308 align:middle line:84%
What do these
quantum things mean?

00:03:48.308 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want
to talk about meaning.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:84%
They said don't ask about
philosophical stuff.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
have answers, that's why.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Well they didn't want
to bring those skeletons out

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.285 align:middle line:90%
of the closet, right?

00:03:56.285 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So they said, just
pass your test,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:90%
don't ask questions like that.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.345 align:middle line:84%
Just do your research,
get your degree

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and don't worry
about that stuff.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Be a good physicist.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask questions.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right, exactly.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And so after about a
year of graduate school,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
I was just really
dissatisfied, and I

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
needed to find
something that was

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.050 align:middle line:84%
going to bring meaning
and balance and purpose

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:90%
back into my life.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And long story short, it
took me about a year--

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:84%
I systematically brought
all these other aspects

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
of life back in, like social
time and creative hobbies

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:90%
and relationships.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, about a year later,
it was like, OK, well, things

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
are better, but they're
still not great.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm still not happy, and
there's some core piece

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:90%
of meaning still missing.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From you.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: For me.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And then this little
new aha moment,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that light bulb turned
on at some point

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:90%
as I was contemplating it.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, oh, you haven't
brought back in spirituality

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:84%
because I'd had it before, but
it was never really primary,

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
or so it didn't seem like it was
that important for me before.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was raised in a fairly
open metaphysical family, which

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
was a great advantage, but I
didn't gravitate towards it.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And then at that point, I
was like, all right, well,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:90%
let's give it a shot.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I started diving into
science and consciousness.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I was so
well-trained in physics

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't
start to just believe

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.100 align:middle line:84%
on blind faith or anything
that didn't complement

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:90%
what I knew scientifically.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.185 align:middle line:84%
So I needed the
deeper stuff, and so I

00:05:29.185 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
got into all the science
and consciousness, science

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, and then
eventually that led me

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:90%
to alchemy and sacred geometry.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
was like, oh, now this

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:90%
is really getting interesting.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting into
some deeper stuff here.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stuff you like.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
looking for community,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and the way I got into
the Modern Mystery School

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
was really just a
personal request

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:84%
to the universe-- like, hey,
I want to find my tribe,

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:90%
my path, my spiritual family.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling
really isolated, not

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:84%
being able to talk to
people at the level of depth

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:90%
that I was looking for.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And within a two-week period
after making that request

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.600 align:middle line:84%
to the universe, synchronicity
came around and introduced me

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:84%
to somebody who was doing
a life activation modality

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
with the Modern Mystery
School, and that

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.775 align:middle line:90%
was my introduction in.

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're hooked.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wasn't
hooked right away.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I noticed results
right away, though.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And as I got this
life activation--

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and I had had lots of other
energy modalities done on me--

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Reiki and this and that and
hands-on healing and all

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:90%
these--

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had activated my
DNA all this kind of stuff--

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
but they felt good in the
moment but didn't really produce

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:84%
long range results,
whereas after this life

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.693 align:middle line:84%
activation from the
Modern Mystery School,

00:06:50.693 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
it was subtle in the
moment, but it was clear.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I felt it.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
seeing results,

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and they just kept going
and going and going.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
After about four
months, I finally

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
realized like, oh, my purpose
is to bring the two together--

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:84%
to bring the science and
the spirituality together,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and that meant I was going
to go on a different track

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:84%
than what I was being trained
to do in traditional science.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
consider yourself

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:84%
a rarity in that you're
a scientist, you're

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
a physicist who is also
studying metaphysics and mystery

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:90%
schools?

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a rarity.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm a rarity.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so there are lots
of scientists, though, who

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:84%
are studying into
various metaphysical,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
whether they're more
Eastern mystical,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:90%
or some are Western mystical.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that I've really
gravitated deeply into almost

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
like a PhD in
Western metaphysics.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.272 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And then
a PhD in physics.

00:07:47.272 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which do you prefer?

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD:
Metaphysics, for sure.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I thought so.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And that became my passion, and
my heart really called me more

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:90%
towards that.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So once I finished
my PhD in physics,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.635 align:middle line:84%
I was very clearly ready to
kind of verge away from it

00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:84%
because it just
felt so stifling.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad you
have that physics background?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: I am now, yeah.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot
from the process,

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and it does put me in a unique
position to be able to--

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: --weave
the two together,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's fascinating
to me, actually,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
to see how well the teachings
from kabbalah and alchemy

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and so forth weave together
with modern science.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Albert Einstein
wrestled with believing in God.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.533 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he got
to the point where

00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
I think he thought there
was something there.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.240 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't quite sure what.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.137 align:middle line:90%
Where are you with that?

00:08:37.137 --> 00:08:38.929 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Where am I
with the idea of God?

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the idea
of this divine creator.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Oh, I've
never had a doubt

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
that there was some divine
aspect to the world,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:90%
to the universe.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And so I've
always had that deep sense

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
source, that there's

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
an intelligence behind the
universe, that there's spirit.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And yet, to me, the
idea of God is not

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:84%
like the religious kind
of connotation of God

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:90%
of the patriarch kind of--

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.897 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fire or
damnation and all that.

00:09:07.897 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, I never
really resonated with that.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's infinite mind.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It's infinite intelligence
and eternal being and spirit

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:84%
energy, and you can't
really define it so well,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and then I feel that
there are levels

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.530 align:middle line:84%
of that source that
then somehow organizes

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:90%
itself to create the universe.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And at each sort of node of
that hierarchical structure,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, there's
intelligence behind it.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:90%
There's spirit in everything.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about your
Mystery Teachings show on Gaia.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, so
Mystery Teachings--

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:90%
we've had now--

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.023 align:middle line:90%
Season 1 has all been produced--

00:09:46.023 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And Season 1
is very much about physics

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.325 align:middle line:90%
and metaphysics.

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A good blend.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, where
is science at today?

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:84%
What is it telling
us, especially

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:90%
from the quantum paradigm?

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Because even though we believe
quantum physics is true now,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and we know it, we still
think in a Newtonian way.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.268 align:middle line:84%
We still tend to think
in a very classical way

00:10:09.268 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:84%
because that's what our
three-dimensional world--

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The apple drops
and stuff like that.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yes.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And you throw a
ball, you kind of

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
have a sense of where
it's going to go.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And so because of our
thinking in a Newtonian way,

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
though, we've kind of
created a limitation.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:84%
We've put ourselves in a box,
and we have this everything

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
has to be linear,
logical, mechanical, kind

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.740 align:middle line:90%
of structured way of operating.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle line:84%
But in our world today, it's
not working that way anymore.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we've evolved beyond
the Scientific Revolution

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
and the Industrial Age
into the Digital Age

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and into the Quantum
Age is coming.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And we need to start thinking
in a more quantum way

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to the rapid
pace of life today.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And so Season 1 is
really about, how

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:84%
do we understand these
quantum principles?

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But not just because oh,
the physics is interesting,

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:84%
but how does it
apply to our life?

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And so then, bringing in
the metaphysics to say,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, ancient
spiritual teachings

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
have been saying the same
thing that science is now

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:90%
coming back around to.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like we were there,
because science came out

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:90%
of alchemy, for example.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And
then we went away.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:84%
The science sort of split away
from alchemy, which was more

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:90%
a spiritually integrated path.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And now with quantum
physics, it's

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.400 align:middle line:84%
like we're kind of
coming full circle back,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.740 align:middle line:84%
even though traditional
scientists wouldn't

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:90%
want to see it that way.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.387 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:11:33.387 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So for
me, it's like, look,

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
these are two
different languages,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
but they're really
saying similar things.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And yet with the
mystical approach,

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:47.870 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of view beyond
what the physics can show us.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe we can
bridge the gap with--

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Maybe.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:90%
I think we can.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I deliver what I hope are some
convincing realizations for how

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:90%
the two complement each other.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
that science proves this,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.257 align:middle line:84%
but they certainly complement,
and they're really pointing

00:12:09.257 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:90%
at a lot of the same things.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But more important is,
how does it apply to us?

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And that was one question I
got a lot as a physicist--

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:90%
well, what are you researching?

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Why should I care?

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: How does
it apply to me?

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
physics, I couldn't really

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
answer that question for
them because I was just

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.020 align:middle line:90%
doing basic science research.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It didn't really
apply to people.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But now, I do see how
this stuff applies.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now you get it.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.282 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And so yeah,
it's like, who are we?

00:12:38.282 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:84%
What does this tell
us about who we

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
are and our potential and
the capacities that we have?

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So that we can start shifting
our internal paradigm of who

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.030 align:middle line:84%
we are and then the
world that is around us

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.162 align:middle line:84%
and the impact that
we can have upon it

00:12:52.162 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:84%
so that we can be more empowered
to activate our potential.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is our, Theresa,
what is our human potential,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:90%
anyways?

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.732 align:middle line:90%
Is it unlimited?

00:12:59.732 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I believe
it's unlimited

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
when we're looking at
it from we are spirit.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:84%
If we think that we are an
eternal being as opposed to I

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:90%
am this body.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.060 align:middle line:84%
If I think I am this
body, well, then,

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:90%
yes, there's limitations here.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
We have the physical laws that
we have to sort of abide by.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But when we realize
that this body is just

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
a vehicle for the
spirit and the soul,

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and as we reach more into
that eternal energy, then

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
now the potentials
are limitless.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And if we can bring that
in more, that energy

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:84%
can come into the body
and help transform,

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
transmute, wake
its potential up.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: We're probably
accessing right now

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:90%
a very small percentage.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
We say that we have
1% to 3% of our DNA

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.217 align:middle line:84%
is actively used to code the
proteins that build the body.

00:13:49.217 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not a lot.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It's not.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:84%
There's this other
97% to 99% of the DNA

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that science is now calling
non-coding sections of the DNA.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:90%
They used to call it junk DNA.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't
know what it did,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and so there's this huge,
huge portion of our DNA

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:84%
that science still
doesn't know what it does.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So we believe its
potential, that there's

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
a lot of genetic
potential in there,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and there's instruction
codes, and there's

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:84%
things that need to be
turned on that can activate

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
new genetic potentials like
super-immunity and ability

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:30.350 align:middle line:84%
to regenerate our bodies and
more enhanced brain activity.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:84%
In our brain, we
have 100% capacity

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:84%
of our brain being used, but
we're only conscious of just

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:90%
maybe 5% to 10%.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And so we can expand more
of our conscious awareness

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
within our body as well.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of room
for growth there.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:90%
And then there's our senses.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.610 align:middle line:84%
We have our five
physical senses.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.730 align:middle line:84%
We have energetic fields that
we can sense through as well.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.403 align:middle line:84%
And again, with any
of our five senses,

00:14:56.403 --> 00:14:58.070 align:middle line:84%
for example, there's
just a narrow range

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:84%
of the spectrum of
possibility of energy

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:90%
that we're perceiving.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You think of the visible
light spectrum, what we see--

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.768 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: It's
such a narrow slice

00:15:07.768 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:90%
in the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
people who claim

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.255 align:middle line:84%
to be clairvoyant, for example,
and that they see energy.

00:15:15.255 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe they are.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.505 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they just
have a little bit

00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:84%
of a broader range
of what they are

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
able to perceive consciously
through their senses.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that is a
potential that's in all of us,

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:84%
that we have these capacities
to expand how much we're really

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.017 align:middle line:84%
manifesting of our
full potential.

00:15:33.017 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Mystery Teachings"--
you deal with a lot

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:90%
of subjects.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.962 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look.

00:15:37.962 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: Initiates in the
Mystery School traditions

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:10%
have long been aware of
this potential within us.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:10%
Thousands of years
ago, King Solomon,

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:10%
one of the greatest Western
Mystery School lineage holders,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:10%
was searching for
a way to activate

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:10%
the galactic codes
and the divinity codes

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:10%
within each person's
tree of life.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.000 align:middle line:10%
We now know this tree
of life is our DNA.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:10%
It is the blueprint
of who we are.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.030 align:middle line:10%
But most people come
into this physical life

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:10%
with only a fraction of
their tree of life activated.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:10%
King Solomon knew that there
was a time in the beginning when

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:10%
humans were fully activated but
that we lost that over time.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:10%
Yet it was prophecy that one
day humans would once again

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:27.240 align:middle line:10%
rise to their full glory as
godlike, perfected humans.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:10%
In kabbalah, we call this the
Adam Kadmon, the Perfected

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.470 align:middle line:10%
Human.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:10%
King Solomon made it his
mission to discovering

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:10%
the universal methods to
reactivating all of our codes.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:10%
They made great progress at
turning on many of the codes

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.840 align:middle line:10%
and establishing the
foundation needed

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:10%
for our evolutionary
leap, but the time

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:10%
was not yet right for humanity
to awaken their final codes

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:10%
during King Solomon's
time or to access

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:10%
their full power of their
galactic and divine nature.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:10%
But now is the time.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:10%
We are ready, and
the human collective

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:10%
is poised to make a
great leap forward.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.442 align:middle line:10%
We are the ones our ancestors
have been waiting for.

00:17:12.442 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a great clip.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.119 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Ah, thank you.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.287 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: King Solomon had
it together, didn't he?

00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: King Solomon
was pretty amazing.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
teachings between what

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
we would read to say if we're
only looking at the Bible

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and what we receive when
we're in the oral tradition

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Mystery Schools because
the Mystery Schools really

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:84%
were more about
their oral tradition

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:90%
than just what was written down.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the oral
teachings, which was

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:84%
some of what I was giving
there in that clip,

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
is that King Solomon
really gathered

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
all the different tribes
during his time and the sages

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and the medicine
people and the shamans,

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and they all came
together, and they

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:84%
sort of cross-compared notes
and modalities and tools

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge and
teachings because it

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.740 align:middle line:84%
was like they all had
a piece, but no one had

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:90%
the whole picture.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
Solomon looking for?

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:90%
What answers was he seeking?

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: He was
seeking for the keys

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:84%
to how to restore humans to
their full divine potential,

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
which, in his tradition,
the kabbalistic tradition,

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
they call it the
Adam Kadmon, which

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.290 align:middle line:84%
means the perfected human,
or the godlike human.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And he knew from his
tradition that this

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:84%
was a potential within
humans, that we,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:84%
at one point in
our original state,

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:90%
we were this divine human.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.025 align:middle line:90%
And whether we're looking at--

00:18:31.025 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter which
tradition we're looking at,

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:37.557 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
Judeo-Christian or a Buddhist,

00:18:37.557 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
all of these different
spiritual traditions,

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:84%
they have this prophecy or
this mythology, let's say,

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:90%
of the original state of humans.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And that original state,
there was more harmony,

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
there was more wisdom, there
was more enlightenment,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
there was this ability
to see beyond the veil,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.010 align:middle line:84%
to walk and talk with
the angels, so to speak.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point,
we fell out of that state,

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
or we kind of came
into a denser state,

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.020 align:middle line:84%
where some of those
codes got turned off.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And so King Solomon's
goal was to try and find

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle line:84%
a way back to that state but in
such a way that we activated it

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.703 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves,
that we earned it.

00:19:18.703 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he ever
find those answers?

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.912 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: He found
a lot of answers,

00:19:21.912 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and they developed this
very universal system

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:84%
of teachings and
modalities to help turn

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.718 align:middle line:90%
on more of that potential.

00:19:29.718 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
that life activation

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that I was mentioning
before was one

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:84%
of the modalities that
came out of his time,

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:90%
3,000 plus years ago.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And they found a lot
that would support

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.370 align:middle line:90%
the awakening of people.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But they never found
those final codes

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to actually get
to the final piece

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.923 align:middle line:84%
because as I was
saying in the clip,

00:19:47.923 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
it just wasn't the
timing on the planet.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have we found
those codes today?

00:19:51.298 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: We
have, but now, it's

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:84%
a matter of the codes
are there, and they've

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
been coming through,
so there's more

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
like galactic kind of energies
coming through these days

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and giving us those final
pieces to turn on the codes.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost
like it has to build

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
on top of the old foundation
that all the tribes came up

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
with during the time
of King Solomon.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And upon that foundation, we
can build to the next level

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:90%
to that new paradigm energy.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theresa, what
does ascension mean to you?

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So to
me, ascension means

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
that we are raising the
vibration of the body up,

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:84%
so we're ascending
with the body.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we're
bringing the spirit more down

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to be fully embodied
into the physical.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you almost
can't raise the body up

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
without bringing the spirit
down because the spirit

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
energy coming in is what
activates more and transforms

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and transmutes the physical
body to become more of what

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.090 align:middle line:90%
we would call the light body.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's this dual action of
involution and embodiment

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and then evolution and
ascension towards a higher

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:90%
dimension, higher--

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to me, dimension doesn't mean
physical, spatial dimensions

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:90%
in this case.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:84%
It means more vibrational
planes of different frequencies,

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:09.792 align:middle line:90%
higher frequencies.

00:21:09.792 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they talk
about Jesus ascending--

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yes.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
almost the same thing?

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that, in that case with
Jesus, they say that he did.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:90%
He took his body with him.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So he was said to have
come back from the dead.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So he defeated death, and
he wasn't the only one

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:90%
who defeated death.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We also have stories
of Osiris and Oden

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
sacrificial god archetypes.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet Jesus defeated death and
then ascended the body back up

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to these higher
spiritual planes.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can
we as individuals

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
tap into that kind of mindset in
order to change our own lives?

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, so one
is to realize that we all

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:90%
have that potential within.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Even in Jesus' teachings, he
says, all these things I do,

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:90%
you shall do and more.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, we
have this potential,

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and this is where, I think,
a lot of religious dogma

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:84%
comes in and limits people,
and it suppresses them

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and makes them feel
like they're not worthy.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet we are, and so we need
to reclaim our worthiness,

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
number one, that I
can improve my life,

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that I do deserve
better, that I can

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
activate more potential within
me, that I do have gifts.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So first, it's, I
think, for people

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:84%
to just shift the way
they define themselves

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and how they identify
as being capable.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And then second, through the
right tools and knowledge,

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.680 align:middle line:84%
we can take those and
apply them into our life.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And as we apply these tools
and the right knowledge,

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.380 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to start
creating our life

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
as an empowered
co-creator as opposed

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:84%
to just sort of being at
the effect of everything.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What percent
of people, do you think,

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.250 align:middle line:84%
will have that ability
to make that move?

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I think 100% of
people have the ability.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.197 align:middle line:84%
The question is whether
they have the will.

00:23:02.197 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So I can give somebody the
tools and maybe a few sessions

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that help activate and
turn on those lights

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.770 align:middle line:90%
and those switches for them.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But whether they
then take those tools

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and apply them into their
life, that's about will.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And it is by will
that we really make

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:90%
those things happen in lives.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.018 align:middle line:90%
So it's not something that--

00:23:24.018 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I think ascension is
something that we have

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:90%
to be active participants with.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Alchemy is the same thing.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.340 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn how it works so
that we can drive the process.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not just
making gold, is it?

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:90%
No, it's about our own--

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:84%
it's our transformation, not
only of ourselves but also

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%
of the transformation
we can affect

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
in the world in the
physical domain.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.193 align:middle line:84%
But first, we have
to do it inside.

00:23:46.193 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going
to happen on its own.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
See, we have to be active
participants with it

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:90%
because otherwise we resist it.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:90%
We resist change.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're resisting our
transformation or our change,

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a much
slower process, left up

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to just natural evolution
to get us there.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And yet if we participate
with our change

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.553 align:middle line:84%
and our transformation,
and we understand--

00:24:11.553 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:84%
this is what alchemy
is all about.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Understand the laws of nature.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Understand the laws
of the universe

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
so that we can harness
them and then speed it up.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
ascension is about-- it's

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:84%
about doing the alchemy
so that we can speed up

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:90%
our own evolution.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But we have to participate
with it in the right way.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lee Harris, who is
a healer and a channeler,

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:90%
talked about ascension as well.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's get his perspective
from the Gaia show Buzzsaw.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: OK.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.117 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE HARRIS: Well, I feel
we all have a connection.

00:24:38.117 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:10%
So my perspective on it is there
are many, many, many layers.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:10%
So there are all
of these layers.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:10%
There are all of
these dimensions.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:10%
And some of us will align
with a certain group

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.570 align:middle line:10%
or a certain guide,
but I do believe we all

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:10%
have our own guides.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:10%
But I've met some channelers
who are not just channelers who

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:10%
are in the public realm.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.833 align:middle line:10%
I've met some people who
are channeling off-world,

00:24:58.833 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:10%
and that's their
contact, and I've

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:10%
met others who don't
see it that way,

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:10%
but they just have a wisdom
voice or a higher self.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:10%
So for me, everything up here
is accessible to all of us

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:10%
if we either have an opening,
or we cultivate a desire.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:10%
So one thing I kind
of recognize is

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:10%
I bought this book called "How
to Connect with your Spiritual

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.090 align:middle line:10%
Guide" not long before
I started channeling.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.160 align:middle line:10%
I never read it, but I
had it in my presence,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:10%
and I'm a big believer in that--
have the title or the word

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:10%
or the affirmation
in your presence,

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.035 align:middle line:10%
and it kind of helps send
a sign to the universe

00:25:31.035 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:10%
that you're open and ready.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:10%
But I do believe
everyone has contact.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, he's like you.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:84%
He believes everybody
has that ability.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Mm-hmm.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I fully agree that
everyone has that ability

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:84%
to connect to their own
guides and to angelic beings

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and to spirit, and it
starts with our intention,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and it starts with opening
up, saying, OK, I need help.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what got
me going on my path,

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
was I need help,
guide me, support me,

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:84%
help me find my path, help
me find the right people.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we put that request out
to the universe, to our guides,

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:84%
whoever, whatever
aspect we believe in--

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:84%
yeah, then we're
opening the door.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a spiritual law of free
will that others of the light

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.010 align:middle line:84%
would not impose upon
another person's will.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And so for us to have that
support coming in from spirit,

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask for it
because otherwise, they

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:90%
can't impose upon our will.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the asking
and the intention

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:84%
opens up the door for that
to come in and support us.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
made a dramatic change

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:84%
from the physicist to where
you are today, haven't you?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: I have.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, it's been--

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.122 align:middle line:84%
who I was then and who I am
today are completely different.

00:26:46.122 --> 00:26:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Night and day.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Completely different.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet I feel that
I am who I always

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.720 align:middle line:84%
felt like I was inside but was
never really quite ready to be.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm becoming that.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.813 align:middle line:84%
And 100% of that is
because of my path

00:26:58.813 --> 00:27:00.480 align:middle line:84%
with the Mystery
School and the training

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:90%
that I've been through--

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
through initiations, through
the kabbalistic ascension

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.350 align:middle line:84%
process up the tree
of life, through all

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.200 align:middle line:84%
the different
activations and codes

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
that have been awakened
and keys and so forth.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.545 align:middle line:84%
But again, I always took those
tools, and I applied them,

00:27:15.545 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and I really let
them in my life.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theresa, what is
called the New Shambhala?

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.060 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: OK, so the New
Shambhala is the prophecy,

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, of,
we mentioned how

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:84%
there was the mythology
that originally we

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
came from this
divine state, and it

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:84%
was more of this enlightened
society or Garden of Eden

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
The New Shambhala is
a prophecy that we

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:90%
will return to that state.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.567 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to the New Garden
of Eden, the Fifth World--

00:27:43.567 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:84%
there's all these
different prophecies

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:84%
from different traditions
that point to--

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
it's like the 1,000
Years of Peace

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
or a time of harmony and
prosperity and everybody

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:84%
getting along, no more wars,
no more disease, and so forth.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would be nice.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It sure would.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating is
that even scientists

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:90%
are talking about this.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.160 align:middle line:84%
They talk about when they're
looking at, for example,

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
if there's intelligent life out
there in the universe that's

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.070 align:middle line:90%
advanced to a certain level--

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.512 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: --how
can we classify that

00:28:13.512 --> 00:28:16.470 align:middle line:84%
so that we can then start to
study the signals coming in

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.693 align:middle line:84%
from outer space
and see if we can

00:28:18.693 --> 00:28:20.360 align:middle line:84%
detect any other
advanced civilizations?

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or
communicate with them.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:10%
And so they talk
about-- in science,

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:10%
they have a Type 1, a Type 2,
a Type 3, and a Type 4 society,

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.000 align:middle line:10%
and these are all based on
how much energy we harness.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And right
now, on that scale,

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:90%
we would be a 0.7 type society.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're not
even at a Type 1?

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: We're not
even at a Type 1.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:84%
A Type 1 society is harnessing
all the energy of their planet

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to the point where they can
control the weather, where

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:84%
they can harness all the
sunlight that hits the planet.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're harnessing it.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.042 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've got aways to go.

00:28:53.042 --> 00:28:54.958 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: We have aways
to go, but scientists

00:28:54.958 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
are predicting that within the
next 100 years, we're there.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.895 align:middle line:84%
So we're right at the precipice,
and the current generations--

00:28:59.895 --> 00:29:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's not a lot of
time, not in universal time.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.642 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: There is
not a lot of time

00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:84%
because we have this
acceleration that's

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.810 align:middle line:84%
happening technologically,
and yet there's

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.390 align:middle line:84%
lack of wisdom in how
we're applying all

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.880 align:middle line:84%
of those technologies
and that advancement,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and then that's having its
impact on the environment,

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.045 align:middle line:84%
or it's having its impact
on population control.

00:29:22.045 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's having its impact
in so many different ways,

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and we're tinkering with things
because we have the knowledge,

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:84%
but we kind of lack
the wisdom for how

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.610 align:middle line:84%
to really apply that
knowledge in the right way.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.277 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
will it take to get up

00:29:31.277 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:90%
to a Type 4 civilization?

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.605 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Oh, that--

00:29:34.605 --> 00:29:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Billions of years?

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Without
intervention by alien races

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.145 align:middle line:84%
who have already
accomplished it,

00:29:39.145 --> 00:29:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it would
take a long time.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But can we get there?

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Of course
we can get there.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you don't
kill yourselves.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: As long as we
don't destroy ourselves

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:90%
in the process.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So right now, this transition
note that we're in right now,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:56.670 align:middle line:84%
that this generation
and the kids today--

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:84%
we're the most
critical generation

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:84%
in terms of successfully making
that leap to the Type 1 society

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.950 align:middle line:84%
or completely failing
and creating a dystopia.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And so we're on
this divergent path,

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.883 align:middle line:84%
and we have one or the
other, and I believe,

00:30:12.883 --> 00:30:15.425 align:middle line:84%
personally, it has everything
to do with human consciousness.

00:30:15.425 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.865 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: All
right, and we have

00:30:17.865 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:84%
to hit that critical
mass of awakening

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.010 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level of
personal responsibility

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and conscious choice in how
we're going to apply things

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.530 align:middle line:84%
for the good of the
whole rather than just

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.210 align:middle line:90%
for the gain of the ego.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's, to me,
why I've dedicated

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.890 align:middle line:84%
my life to the teachings
with the Mystery School

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.530 align:middle line:84%
is because it is
such a critical time.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think if I'm going to do
something with my time that's

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.652 align:middle line:84%
going to really make
the most impact,

00:30:41.652 --> 00:30:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to do it in a
way that helps support

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:90%
that collective awakening.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physicist
Michio Kaku also talks

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.390 align:middle line:84%
about the types of
civilizations we're at

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and would agree
with you that we're

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.920 align:middle line:90%
in the infant stage on the list.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and his book
"Parallel Worlds"

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:84%
really addresses these
four types of societies.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's got a
very inspiring message

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.290 align:middle line:84%
by the end of it all that
yeah, this is an exciting time

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.870 align:middle line:84%
to be alive, and we
have huge possibility

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and huge potential
of what's coming down

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.290 align:middle line:90%
the line in the next--

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.745 align:middle line:84%
even just in the
next five years,

00:31:14.745 --> 00:31:16.620 align:middle line:84%
our world is going to
be completely different

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:90%
than it was.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We want to be
part of that, don't we?

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.318 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: We do, yeah.

00:31:19.318 --> 00:31:22.228 align:middle line:84%
We want to be part of it, and
I think we want to direct it

00:31:22.228 --> 00:31:23.520 align:middle line:90%
in a good way because there's--

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If we can.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: If we can.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we can, and this
is where a lot of times people

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.268 align:middle line:84%
think, oh, it's in the
power of the governments

00:31:31.268 --> 00:31:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and the hands of the
people with the money,

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.143 align:middle line:84%
and they're the ones
manipulating and controlling.

00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And that might be true, but
if we can hit critical mass

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.850 align:middle line:84%
within the collective
of regular people

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.690 align:middle line:84%
to awaken to a higher level
of personal responsibility,

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.680 align:middle line:84%
a higher level of I
am going to achieve

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:90%
more of my personal potential.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I am also going to step into
service in a way that really

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.910 align:middle line:84%
benefits the whole
rather than just doing it

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:84%
for personal gain, then if we
can hit that critical mass,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.320 align:middle line:84%
we will shift the tide
of whatever the 1%

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:84%
is that's controlling
things now.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we can get 1% to 3%
of the masses to wake up,

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:90%
it'll shift the tide.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think, then, that there's
this spontaneous up-leveling

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.790 align:middle line:84%
that happens across the whole
of humanity at that point.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theresa, what
are Mystery Schools?

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Mystery Schools are--

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:84%
so from the training
that I've received,

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:84%
we would define a
Mystery School as having

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
an ancient lineage that
dates back pretty far,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:90%
and it's unbroken.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So we can have
lineage where it's

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.980 align:middle line:84%
like, there's the teachings,
and maybe some initiate wrote

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:84%
a book, and later
we pick up the book,

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:90%
and we study the teachings.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Newer things are added to it.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.752 align:middle line:84%
So that, we would not
call a Mystery School

00:32:44.752 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
because yes, the
teachings, but there

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.800 align:middle line:84%
is a gap now in the initiations
and in the oral handing

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:84%
down, whereas in
a Mystery School,

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:84%
the lineage is unbroken, and it
goes back-- the farther back it

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:84%
goes, the more energy
that's been built up

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.110 align:middle line:84%
in the collective that
surrounds that lineage.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And so in the lineage, there's
both the oral teachings

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.605 align:middle line:84%
of how to really
apply the knowledge.

00:33:07.605 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
about the information.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.290 align:middle line:90%
It's about the application.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And then there's
initiations and different

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.970 align:middle line:84%
empowerments that are conducted
from person to person--

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:84%
in person, not
remotely, but in person.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And then each Mystery
School actually

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.910 align:middle line:84%
anchors what we
would call a ray, so

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
these different rays
of creative energy

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that flow down from
the spiritual realms

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:90%
into the physical.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a certain
number of rays

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that are anchored on the
planet that then need to be

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.330 align:middle line:90%
distributed to the collective.

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And so each Mystery
School is like a guardian

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.630 align:middle line:90%
of one of those rays.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's not something
that we just start.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
handed down and passed down.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
get into the schools?

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So we
talk about there

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.320 align:middle line:84%
being seven ancient Mystery
School lineages on the planet,

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and I can even name
where they are.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:84%
There's Tibet, high
in the Himalayas.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, you
would expect that.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.498 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
and the Dalai Lama

00:34:03.498 --> 00:34:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is the head of that
initiatory lineage.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.830 align:middle line:90%
There's Japan, on Mt.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Kurama.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: There's a
Japanese Mystery School.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.140 align:middle line:84%
There is in Europe, currently
in England somewhere--

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:18.120 align:middle line:90%
England?

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Probably
anchored in Glastonbury,

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.620 align:middle line:84%
but it's behind the
scenes at this point.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.804 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a mystery.

00:34:23.804 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It is a mystery.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.721 align:middle line:84%
But at one point in
time, they did come out

00:34:26.721 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:90%
as the Golden Dawn.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, it was
the Fama Fraternitatis.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:84%
They're also connected into
the lineage of King Solomon.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:39.760 align:middle line:84%
There's one in North America
that was held for a long time

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.260 align:middle line:84%
by the Hopi, and then that
got transferred into--

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.510 align:middle line:84%
there was a blending
or uniting that

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.150 align:middle line:84%
happened between
lineage of King Solomon

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.810 align:middle line:84%
from the Golden Dawn sort of
European tradition and lineage

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:55.560 align:middle line:84%
with the Native American
lineage that was anchored here

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.730 align:middle line:90%
in North America.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And that then was when
the Modern Mystery

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:84%
School opened its doors, is
when those two lines combined.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
one in Romania,

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and that one's deep in
the Transylvania Alps.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And there was one in Australia
and one in the Congo in Africa.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who determines where
they were and what they did?

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.017 align:middle line:90%
Different groups?

00:35:22.017 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I think that
the spiritual planes

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:24.980 align:middle line:90%
would determine that.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So it was
something that was anchored,

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and then the keys
and the guardianship

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and the responsibility
for that ray and that--

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.040 align:middle line:90%
each ray has unique purpose.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, each Mystery School
has unique function or purpose

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:84%
in the energies it's supposed
to be generating and sending out

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
to the collective and the types
of teachings that it offers.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And so these are the
ancient lineages.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.620 align:middle line:84%
There was more on the
planet at one time,

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.110 align:middle line:84%
but some of those
other lineages,

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.730 align:middle line:84%
it's like there
was a gap, and they

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.950 align:middle line:90%
lost the transfer of energy.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And so now there's these
seven, and of those seven, one,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:84%
in any one century, one of
them will open its doors

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.450 align:middle line:84%
so that people from the
public can find their way.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.123 align:middle line:84%
But you never know
how long that's

00:36:09.123 --> 00:36:10.790 align:middle line:84%
going to last with
the doors being open.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And then so
in the last century,

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.390 align:middle line:84%
the Golden Dawn,
the one in England,

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.130 align:middle line:84%
was open-door and
the early 1900s.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
attend these schools, Theresa?

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Lots?

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: That depends
on the school, I think.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, it's going to be
just a small group of people.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 10 people?

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Possibly.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.830 align:middle line:90%
That small?

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: For example--

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or less.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of them, depending
on the times that they were in,

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.890 align:middle line:84%
it could have been at
threat of their life

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to even believe in
those things because it

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.000 align:middle line:84%
didn't agree with whatever the
political or religious powers

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:84%
that be were wanting to
establish as the main.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And so there's persecutions,
and there was inquisitions

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and all these kinds of things.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.102 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes they had
to do it very underground

00:36:56.102 --> 00:36:57.810 align:middle line:84%
just to preserve and
protect the lineage.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And protect themselves.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And then
other times, the society

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:84%
would be ready for them to
come out into the open again,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and you'd have a
renaissance, a golden age,

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:10.033 align:middle line:84%
an age of enlightenment when
those teachings came out again.

00:37:10.033 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So last century was the Golden
Dawn that opened its doors.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.650 align:middle line:84%
This century, it's the
Modern Mystery School

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:15.650 align:middle line:90%
that's opened its doors.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us an example
of what these schools could do

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:23.110 align:middle line:84%
for somebody or for a group
of people or for a society.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So for
us, for example,

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.420 align:middle line:84%
within the Modern
Mystery School,

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.940 align:middle line:84%
it was in 1997
that the doors were

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:90%
said be, OK, open the doors.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.893 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: And it
was right as we were

00:37:33.893 --> 00:37:35.460 align:middle line:10%
coming into the new millennium.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.800 align:middle line:10%
And basically, the
instruction we were given

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.390 align:middle line:10%
was, no more secrets.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:43.110 align:middle line:84%
It's time to make the
initiations available,

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:46.110 align:middle line:84%
make the empowerment
available, make the teachings

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.000 align:middle line:90%
openly taught.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty
unprecedented, actually,

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.530 align:middle line:84%
what I'm doing with the
Mystery Teaching series

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:84%
because this is the first time
that these ancient Mystery

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.915 align:middle line:84%
School teachings and
some of the methods

00:37:57.915 --> 00:37:59.790 align:middle line:84%
are even being taught
in this kind of format.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's always
been done in person--

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: --face to face.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:06.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to have been sort
of approved and whatnot.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty amazing that
I've been given permission

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.550 align:middle line:84%
to even do this in
this kind of format.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
exciting for you.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.468 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: It is
exciting, I think,

00:38:12.468 --> 00:38:15.900 align:middle line:84%
for the people who are getting
to get more easy access to some

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.970 align:middle line:90%
of these teachings and methods.

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
But really, ultimately,
I find for me,

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:25.020 align:middle line:84%
my own life was the proof
of what it can do for us.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.180 align:middle line:90%
It really took me from being--

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.313 align:middle line:84%
I was very Type A, pretty
insecure but really determined.

00:38:31.313 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a scientist.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I was a scientist,
and yet I had my imbalances.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I had my places where I
really was not accomplishing

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:44.430 align:middle line:90%
my full potential.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would we
have liked you then

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.660 align:middle line:84%
compared to you today,
in terms of just

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that overall perspective
of who you were or are?

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I think that
I was likable enough,

00:38:54.820 --> 00:39:02.813 align:middle line:84%
but I was probably more
reserved and more uptight

00:39:02.813 --> 00:39:03.730 align:middle line:90%
about a lot of things.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:03.930 align:middle line:90%
I was really controlling.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:05.192 align:middle line:90%
A little more deliberate?

00:39:05.192 --> 00:39:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I was
really controlling.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I tried to be nice,
but I was very insecure

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.755 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of social interactions.

00:39:12.755 --> 00:39:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And so by now,
it's like, OK, I am who I am,

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:16.520 align:middle line:90%
and there's more confidence.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We only
know you like this.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:22.062 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, my mom knew
me better than anyone.

00:39:22.062 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my first year
with the Mystery School--

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.075 align:middle line:84%
after one year, right, so just
after a 10-month program that I

00:39:27.075 --> 00:39:28.890 align:middle line:84%
had been through with their
Universal Kabbalah Ascension

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Program--

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: --my mom was like--

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.200 align:middle line:84%
because I was living
in Seattle, but then I

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.620 align:middle line:84%
went and visited my
family for the holidays,

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and of course there's
nothing like family

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.280 align:middle line:90%
to know what buttons to push.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And we kind get
into our dynamics

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
when you've been hanging
out for long enough.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But she noticed a
change in me in how

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.160 align:middle line:84%
I was responding to those
old dynamics with my family

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.210 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point,
she's like, who are you?

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.470 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.250 align:middle line:90%
What have you been doing?

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where's my daughter?

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: But no, she
was very impressed.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.550 align:middle line:84%
She was like, oh, whatever
you're doing, it's really good.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.830 align:middle line:84%
You're really handling
things with such

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:12.270 align:middle line:84%
a more mature, just different
way of handling things.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I transformed this one
situation really quickly

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.280 align:middle line:90%
with my sister at one point.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And the tools from
the Mystery Schools

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:84%
really help us to
live a better life.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.275 align:middle line:84%
They help us to
master ourselves.

00:40:24.275 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, shouldn't
we all go through this?

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.017 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Absolutely.

00:40:27.017 --> 00:40:28.560 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But it takes that
decision, one that we

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.230 align:middle line:84%
want to change your
life because again, we

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.480 align:middle line:90%
tend to resist change.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.440 align:middle line:90%
We get into our comfort zone.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.730 align:middle line:84%
We have all kinds of excuses
we create for why I can't.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.055 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's the
job, or it's the kid,

00:40:44.055 --> 00:40:46.430 align:middle line:84%
or I have enough time or enough
money or whatever it is--

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:48.710 align:middle line:90%
we always create these excuses.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, we'd love
everybody to do this,

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.988 align:middle line:84%
but people have
to want to do it,

00:40:53.988 --> 00:40:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and they have to be ready
to invest in themselves

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.310 align:middle line:84%
because this is
about empowerment.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.110 align:middle line:84%
If people think, well,
if it's meant to be,

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.580 align:middle line:90%
it'll just happen for me.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.860 align:middle line:84%
It will just magically
appear, and the way--

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think you've got
to work for it, don't you?

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: You do.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:06.320 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.028 align:middle line:84%
You have to work for
it because only when

00:41:08.028 --> 00:41:10.430 align:middle line:84%
we work for it do we
actually gain our strengths

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and realize certain resources
in us that we didn't realize

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.360 align:middle line:90%
we had before.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.402 align:middle line:84%
So it's like we almost
have to meet the challenge

00:41:16.402 --> 00:41:18.810 align:middle line:84%
head on and apply our
will to make it happen.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.068 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Especially
when it comes

00:41:21.068 --> 00:41:22.400 align:middle line:90%
to an initiatory tradition.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.190 align:middle line:84%
You have to really have a
certain level of discipline

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and will to make it happen
rather than just, well, if it's

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.360 align:middle line:90%
all meant to be, it'll happen.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once people go
through this kind of training,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.080 align:middle line:84%
as you have, what
happens to them?

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:84%
What kind of change
can you expect?

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Well, I
find that people really

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.740 align:middle line:84%
get into a greater level
of self-awareness, number

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.420 align:middle line:84%
one, and greater
ability to harness

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and manage their own energies.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So there's always
going to be events

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.348 align:middle line:84%
that happen in our life
that's going to challenge us.

00:41:53.348 --> 00:41:56.390 align:middle line:84%
That does not change because
we're here to live this life,

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and we're here to
be challenged by it.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But prior to Mystery
School training,

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.150 align:middle line:84%
people will usually default into
their subconscious reactions

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and emotionalism and judgments
and whatnot and blame

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.255 align:middle line:84%
and thinking it's
everybody else.

00:42:10.255 --> 00:42:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But when they get into the
Mystery School training,

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.880 align:middle line:84%
they start becoming
more self-aware.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.040 align:middle line:84%
They start realizing
how they're helping

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.360 align:middle line:90%
contribute to those situations.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.652 align:middle line:84%
They're realizing, oh, that's
triggering this old issue

00:42:19.652 --> 00:42:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that I haven't
healed within myself.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they start
to make changes

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:28.760 align:middle line:84%
within that then result
in changes outside.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.540 align:middle line:84%
It changes their dynamics
with relationships.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It changes their
ability-- they find

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:84%
that they are able to break
through various issues

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:90%
around abundance.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:84%
They find that they're
able to really harness

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:44.570 align:middle line:84%
themselves to get their
life into the level of what

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.370 align:middle line:90%
they dream.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there's a lot
of really practical benefits

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that come for helping give
us a higher quality of life

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:84%
from the inside out, as opposed
to seeking it from the outside

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:56.450 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us some examples
of the training and methods

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that go through this
kind of training.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.648 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So we
use a lot of tools

00:43:05.648 --> 00:43:07.940 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to find in
many different traditions.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.523 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we use
meditation, and there's

00:43:09.523 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:90%
various forms of meditation.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.210 align:middle line:84%
We use rituals, which
are a more active way

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.730 align:middle line:84%
of stepping in and sort
of harnessing the energies

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and calling those energies
in and directing them

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.490 align:middle line:90%
towards a purpose or intent.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.860 align:middle line:90%
We use building of qi.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.960 align:middle line:84%
We use study and working
into the more ancient texts

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and studying those
deeper concepts.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.760 align:middle line:90%
We work with prayer.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So we use all these
different tools,

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:39.953 align:middle line:84%
and then, for example,
if somebody came,

00:43:39.953 --> 00:43:42.370 align:middle line:84%
first they would get a life
activation because that's just

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.250 align:middle line:90%
sort of turns on the switches.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
a life activation?

00:43:44.708 --> 00:43:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: That's helping
wake up their DNA potential

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.938 align:middle line:84%
and bring a certain level of
balance to their energy field.

00:43:50.938 --> 00:43:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we would start
them off with getting

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.320 align:middle line:84%
a life activation, which is
like a one-on-one session

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.120 align:middle line:90%
that people do.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It's about two hours
with a practitioner.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
if they were to come

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.290 align:middle line:90%
and really get it--

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:04.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want to
experience the Mystery

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.900 align:middle line:84%
School and its
teachings and training,

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.803 align:middle line:84%
the next big main step
would be something

00:44:07.803 --> 00:44:09.470 align:middle line:84%
called Empower Thyself
initiation, which

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is the first step of initiation
into the Mystery School path.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's a two-day
training, and we

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.710 align:middle line:84%
have 10 different topics that
we cover during those two days.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that gets
packed into those two days,

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's everywhere from
deep spiritual philosophy--

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.010 align:middle line:90%
who are we?

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going from here?

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.960 align:middle line:84%
What's the nature of the
spirit, the soul, the body?

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.350 align:middle line:90%
How does our energy field work?

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Teaching about a bit of the
kaballah, teaching about ego--

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.140 align:middle line:84%
negative ego, positive
ego, how our mind

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
processes information, how we
can harness our senses more.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And we get a lot
of practical tools.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I find within the
Mystery School,

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:49.190 align:middle line:84%
in the Modern Mystery School,
it's very much about here's

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.570 align:middle line:84%
the tools so you can go
and empower your life,

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and so we're giving
you this tool.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Now you can go use
it and live it.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
deliver the practical

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.778 align:middle line:84%
before some of the theoretical
because in the past,

00:45:02.778 --> 00:45:04.070 align:middle line:90%
it would've been the other way.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:06.195 align:middle line:84%
You might have just studied
and studied and studied

00:45:06.195 --> 00:45:09.625 align:middle line:84%
and did all theory before
you got into the practical.

00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:11.000 align:middle line:84%
But in today's
world, it's almost

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.790 align:middle line:84%
like we lack the time to
do all the theory before we

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:15.380 align:middle line:90%
get into the practice.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're introducing
people straight away

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.150 align:middle line:84%
into the practice, and
then along the way,

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.550 align:middle line:84%
the theory reveals itself
more, and we can then

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:23.642 align:middle line:90%
deepen that practice.

00:45:23.642 --> 00:45:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
you've mentioned

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.260 align:middle line:84%
you've completed Season
1 of Mystery Teachings.

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yes.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.980 align:middle line:10%
Is there a way to harness
our quantum potential

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:38.960 align:middle line:10%
and truly direct the
course of reality?

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.470 align:middle line:10%
Many people are talking about
a shift in human evolution.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.240 align:middle line:90%
What is driving this shift?

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And how do we steer it
in a positive direction?

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.980 align:middle line:10%
The answers to these questions
truly rests in our hands.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.460 align:middle line:10%
Human thought is still very
much stuck in a Newtonian way

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.810 align:middle line:10%
of operating.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:10%
One thing is for sure--

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.910 align:middle line:10%
achieving such a balance will
require a core shift in how

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:10%
we think, act, and relate--

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.580 align:middle line:10%
in other words,
a paradigm shift.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.895 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is Mystery Teachings.

00:46:12.895 --> 00:46:19.933 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.933 --> 00:46:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem like you
have fun doing this show.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: I do.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a very interesting
process for me, actually.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:29.360 align:middle line:84%
It was a new
challenge, for sure.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But bringing the science,
digging back into the science

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:36.290 align:middle line:84%
in a really deep
way helped remind

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.998 align:middle line:84%
me of what I was interested
in science from the beginning,

00:46:38.998 --> 00:46:41.540 align:middle line:84%
but then being able to weave it
together with the metaphysics

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and weave this story
along through Season 1.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.128 align:middle line:84%
It was like, OK, this
is why I got that PhD

00:46:48.128 --> 00:46:49.670 align:middle line:84%
so that I could
really start bringing

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.820 align:middle line:84%
this kind of information to
people and weaving it together.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of
personal discoveries

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:56.870 align:middle line:90%
to take it even deeper--

00:46:56.870 --> 00:47:00.380 align:middle line:84%
for example, I figured out how
to put the whole standard model

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.980 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics onto the tree
of life in three dimensions,

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.060 align:middle line:90%
and that was--

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:06.860 align:middle line:90%
I always knew it could go.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was some
way to arrange it

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:10.430 align:middle line:84%
all on the tree of
life from kabbalah,

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.500 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't quite dig
into it until I was

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.630 align:middle line:90%
preparing for this Season 1.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So it was fun for me to have
some of those aha moments

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.263 align:middle line:84%
and discoveries again,
linking it to the science.

00:47:20.263 --> 00:47:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm
glad Gaia, too,

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.250 align:middle line:84%
recognizes the need
for programs like this

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:26.537 align:middle line:90%
and for people like you.

00:47:26.537 --> 00:47:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I'm very
grateful to Gaia as well

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:30.200 align:middle line:90%
for giving me that chance.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And so Season 1 was very
much about the theory

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and the concepts and weaving
the science and the metaphysics

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.350 align:middle line:84%
together to give it
just some credibility,

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:43.305 align:middle line:84%
give the metaphysics
more of a credibility.

00:47:43.305 --> 00:47:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
needed that, but a lot

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:46.670 align:middle line:90%
of people in today's world do.

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.770 align:middle line:90%
They trust the science.

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:52.040 align:middle line:90%
And so this was to help bridge.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And then Season 2 is
now OK, how do we really

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:55.470 align:middle line:90%
apply this to our lives?

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:57.230 align:middle line:84%
How do we really take
this in and start

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:58.500 align:middle line:90%
harnessing our potential?

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.030 align:middle line:90%
What is our potential?

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:03.710 align:middle line:84%
We get into from everywhere
from the DNA to the senses

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:06.860 align:middle line:84%
to the brain and how the brain
works, the nervous system

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and how we start using
various activities and methods

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and stimuli to help turn on
and rewire the brain and body

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and so forth so that we can
use more of the capacity that

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:19.700 align:middle line:90%
is within us.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like you're
using your science ability now

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:25.540 align:middle line:84%
to shift into the
metaphysical end of it.

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm using the
science as a foundation

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.010 align:middle line:90%
to help people understand.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It grounds
you, doesn't it?

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:33.802 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It's grounded, yeah.

00:48:33.802 --> 00:48:35.960 align:middle line:90%
This isn't just woo-woo.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:39.350 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just spiritual
energy, new age stuff.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:40.963 align:middle line:90%
This is-- we're talking science.

00:48:40.963 --> 00:48:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We call
it mummy foo-foo.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.975 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Mummy foo-foo, OK.

00:48:43.975 --> 00:48:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a new word.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I haven't
heard that one yet.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've created that word.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.167 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Oh, that's yours?

00:48:48.167 --> 00:48:50.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, mummy foo-foo, yes.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:50.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's not that--

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to hear you say
that on your Mystery Teachings

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:90%
show.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: This is not
mummy foo-foo, everyone.

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so this is not that.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:84%
This is like, hey, there
is a reason to all of this.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why all
this works the way it does,

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.942 align:middle line:84%
and because there's a reason,
that means here is natural law,

00:49:06.942 --> 00:49:09.960 align:middle line:84%
there's physical law, and
therefore, there's alchemy,

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.870 align:middle line:90%
we can learn how to harness it.

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And if we learn what the right
vibrations and stimuli are

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to bring in a harmonious
way, we can rewire our system

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.760 align:middle line:84%
to retrain it to really
give us more access

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.680 align:middle line:84%
to our optimal
functioning because when

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.170 align:middle line:84%
we were growing up, we didn't
have that proper upbringing.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: We didn't have the
proper stimuli and training

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:29.730 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:31.313 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But are
some people, Theresa,

00:49:31.313 --> 00:49:32.930 align:middle line:90%
born with this ability?

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
some people are.

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where it's
just natural for them.

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:38.538 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I think that even
if they're born with it,

00:49:38.538 --> 00:49:39.580 align:middle line:90%
they still need training.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Because if
they're born with it,

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.840 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
so out of the norm

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.445 align:middle line:84%
that they're not going to
understand, why am I this way?

00:49:48.445 --> 00:49:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And if they don't
get the proper training--

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.340 align:middle line:84%
I think this applies to a lot
of the millennial generation

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.020 align:middle line:84%
or what in spiritual
traditions were

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.450 align:middle line:84%
going to call the Indigo
Generation, or the younger

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:00.350 align:middle line:90%
kids.

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:02.780 align:middle line:84%
They're coming in with
these different gifts,

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and yet a lot of them
came into a society that

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.310 align:middle line:84%
wasn't ready for them and
didn't know how to support them.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And so even though
they were born with it,

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.780 align:middle line:84%
their psychology got
really messed up.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And then some of them
went to drugs as a way

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.718 align:middle line:84%
to cope because they just
had to numb everything out.

00:50:19.718 --> 00:50:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then they got
deeper and deeper and deeper

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.250 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And then they lost
their ability to really harness

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.640 align:middle line:90%
what they're here for.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:29.488 align:middle line:84%
And so they need the training,
even if they're born that way.

00:50:29.488 --> 00:50:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that why the
suicide rate is so high,

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that?

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: I believe so, yeah.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.320 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to come into a world,
an environment where you've

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.235 align:middle line:84%
got this uniqueness about you
and these gifts you're supposed

00:50:42.235 --> 00:50:43.610 align:middle line:84%
to be manifesting,
and yet you're

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.560 align:middle line:84%
not being supported
by the people who

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.380 align:middle line:84%
are around you as you're
growing up as a child.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.990 align:middle line:84%
That's going to cause a
lot of deep psyche issues.

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:52.487 align:middle line:90%
But no matter whether we were--

00:50:52.487 --> 00:50:55.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody was born with
it, and I think at some level,

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.380 align:middle line:84%
we all shut it down because
of our indoctrination.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Life tends to do that, too.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, traumas,
and just as children,

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.840 align:middle line:84%
we have these
experiences, and we don't

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.132 align:middle line:90%
know how to make sense of them.

00:51:07.132 --> 00:51:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So we try to make sense
of it, and then it's

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:10.550 align:middle line:84%
from a limited
perspective, and then

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.110 align:middle line:84%
we end up shutting things
down because of that.

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:17.012 align:middle line:84%
But as adults, we
want to reconnect

00:51:17.012 --> 00:51:18.470 align:middle line:84%
because we know
that at some level,

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:20.000 align:middle line:90%
there's something missing.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a part of
us that's missing.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to
reconnect and reclaim that,

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and that is a
process where we need

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:30.040 align:middle line:84%
to now get the proper
retraining, reprogramming,

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:35.560 align:middle line:84%
so that we can rewire our mental
constructs, our nervous system,

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:39.910 align:middle line:84%
brain wiring, all of it so that
we can really start to tap back

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:41.470 align:middle line:90%
in to how we were meant to be.

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many physicists,
Theresa, get this?

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.265 align:middle line:90%
I would say not a lot.

00:51:47.265 --> 00:51:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Not a lot, a
couple, a small percentage.

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But those that do--

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.020 align:middle line:84%
doesn't it make their work
and the work of science

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.270 align:middle line:90%
even better?

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I'm sure
those who do get it--

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.150 align:middle line:90%
they believe that.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:03.640 align:middle line:84%
They feel that like me, going
through my science training,

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.810 align:middle line:84%
every time I saw one of
those just amazing things,

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:12.850 align:middle line:84%
the fine-tuning of the universe
or how the number phi and e

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and pi all relate together.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd see these things,
and it always, to me,

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.950 align:middle line:84%
would be evidence that
there's intelligence--

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: --behind
this universe and that

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:25.010 align:middle line:84%
there is a spiritual
quality to it.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of those
scientists who do get this,

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.080 align:middle line:84%
they sort of had that kind
of feeling all along the way.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I have met a couple, though,
who were atheists prior.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.020 align:middle line:84%
They were scientists, but
they were open-minded.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They became believers.

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And only through
their research did--

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
atheists or agnostics?

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: They would have
called themselves atheists.

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nonbelievers.

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Nonbelievers, yeah.

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:51.510 align:middle line:84%
They were very much in the
material kind of mindset.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.220 align:middle line:90%
And yet they were open-minded.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like a belief system.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are
meant to question,

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and don't allow our biases
to affect our research.

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet we tend to get
into our own biases,

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.720 align:middle line:84%
so science has its
own dogma today.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.320 align:middle line:90%
It sure does.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Just like
any religion does.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And yet there are
certain scientists

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:14.890 align:middle line:84%
who, maybe they're
a materialist,

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:19.150 align:middle line:84%
but they followed the
full line of logic

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to try and figure out what
consciousness really is,

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and then they question
their assumptions,

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and then they turned it on
its head, and they realized,

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:26.020 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:28.270 align:middle line:84%
The only conclusion is
consciousness is primary.

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:29.692 align:middle line:90%
It comes first.

00:53:29.692 --> 00:53:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the material
comes second.

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can we use
this to help the world?

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.230 align:middle line:84%
There's that inner self, and
then there's that outer self.

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right.

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we take
care of the bigger picture?

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So one of the principles
that I introduced in Season 1

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:47.950 align:middle line:84%
is the principle
of correspondence,

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:50.917 align:middle line:84%
and it also relates in quantum
physics to entanglement.

00:53:50.917 --> 00:53:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's as the
inner, so the outer.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.903 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're going
to shift in Season 2.

00:53:54.903 --> 00:53:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Season
2 is now, how do

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.520 align:middle line:90%
we take this into application?

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you make it work?

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.907 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: How do we
make it work, yeah.

00:54:00.907 --> 00:54:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So if we can make
changes on the inside,

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.190 align:middle line:84%
that will automatically start
sending out the ripple effect

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:07.730 align:middle line:90%
through the collective.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So number one, we can
focus on the inner

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and make those changes inside
to really harness ourselves,

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and the more people who do that,
the more we can start moving

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.580 align:middle line:84%
towards that
critical mass number,

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:22.510 align:middle line:84%
the more that will then create
a big shift in the world.

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:24.970 align:middle line:84%
But at a very
practical level, we

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.730 align:middle line:90%
can start within our own home.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to
awaken that divinity,

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:33.790 align:middle line:84%
let's say, within
ourselves, but then how am I

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:35.230 align:middle line:90%
expressing that into my life?

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:37.960 align:middle line:84%
How am I-- is my
home environment

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.570 align:middle line:84%
conducive to this
state of harmony

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and Shambhala, peace,
world of peace?

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Am I creating peace
within my own home

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and within my
relationships immediately?

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.497 align:middle line:84%
And then we can expand the
bubble a little bit more.

00:54:50.497 --> 00:54:51.580 align:middle line:90%
How about in my community?

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.170 align:middle line:84%
What am I doing in my community
to make that difference?

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:55.600 align:middle line:90%
And then how about in the world?

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.738 align:middle line:84%
Is there some big
project or some cause

00:54:57.738 --> 00:54:59.780 align:middle line:84%
in the world that I feel
really passionate about,

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.080 align:middle line:84%
that I would want to
see a shift in that way?

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe that's
part of your purpose,

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and so step into really
taking an active role

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to help make a
difference in a bigger,

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.390 align:middle line:90%
bigger way in the world.

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had this moment
to talk with Albert Einstein,

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:17.935 align:middle line:84%
what would you be
talking to him about?

00:55:17.935 --> 00:55:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I would be
probably talking to him

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:22.990 align:middle line:84%
about the cosmological
constant because he called it

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:24.860 align:middle line:84%
his biggest blunder
when he was alive.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And the
cosmological constant

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.820 align:middle line:84%
was this idea that
there is an accelerating

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.400 align:middle line:84%
force in the universe
somehow counteracting

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.810 align:middle line:90%
gravitational pull.

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
say it's not there?

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: No, it is there.

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is there.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It is there now.

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He said
it wasn't, though.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: He said it
was his biggest blunder.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, science is coming
full circle back around to it,

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:49.550 align:middle line:84%
saying, no, the universe is
expanding at an accelerated

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:50.350 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main
theories is that there

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.730 align:middle line:84%
must be this cosmological
constant, meaning that there's

00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:03.400 align:middle line:84%
some anti-gravity force, some
expansive force coming straight

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.450 align:middle line:90%
out of the vacuum.

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:07.462 align:middle line:84%
In every little cubic
centimeter of space,

00:56:07.462 --> 00:56:08.920 align:middle line:84%
straight out of
the vacuum, there's

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.410 align:middle line:84%
some kind of force
pushing itself out.

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back into
the ancient alchemical idea

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:19.330 align:middle line:84%
of an ether, that there
is this sort of dimension

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:22.910 align:middle line:84%
of etheric energy between the
physical and the spiritual,

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and that that plane
of the ether is--

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:28.950 align:middle line:84%
today, we would call the Quantum
Sea and the quantum potential.

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think that if he hadn't
called that his biggest

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.280 align:middle line:84%
blunder, I think he
might have actually-- we

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:37.380 align:middle line:84%
would have been further along
in our scientific understanding

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.180 align:middle line:90%
than we are today.

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Because
quantum physics

00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and Einstein's relativity
are the two major pillars

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:45.942 align:middle line:90%
of science today.

00:56:45.942 --> 00:56:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's what drives it.

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But they don't agree
with each other.

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:50.630 align:middle line:90%
They're at odds.

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, and so I
think that there's some things

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:56.240 align:middle line:84%
that Einstein missed
because he didn't

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.860 align:middle line:84%
like some of the implications
of quantum theory.

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.290 align:middle line:84%
He didn't like God doesn't
play dice with the universe.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:02.540 align:middle line:90%
He didn't like the randomness.

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would he have liked
your thoughts about things?

00:57:04.925 --> 00:57:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: I hope so.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure he would have had--

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:10.340 align:middle line:84%
we would have had some
pretty dynamic conversations

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:13.670 align:middle line:84%
because he was a pretty
staunch materialist, actually.

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:17.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, not materialist,
but he was

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:21.080 align:middle line:10%
into the reductionist model,
a very classical there's

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.790 align:middle line:10%
got to be a reason
behind everything,

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:25.653 align:middle line:10%
everything has a
certain order to it.

00:57:25.653 --> 00:57:26.570 align:middle line:90%
There's purpose to it.

00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with all of that,
but he was looking at it

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.000 align:middle line:84%
from that Newtonian
paradigm, whereas I

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.270 align:middle line:90%
agree that there is an order.

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:34.310 align:middle line:90%
There is a cause and effect.

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:35.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
behind everything,

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.978 align:middle line:84%
but we have to look
at so many more

00:57:36.978 --> 00:57:39.320 align:middle line:84%
planes of causation
and vibrational levels

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.412 align:middle line:90%
for how that works.

00:57:40.412 --> 00:57:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if
today, someone were

00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:45.830 align:middle line:84%
to give you a title, a new
title, what would that be?

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: A new title?

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you want to be called?

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: I don't even know.

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A metaphysicist?

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'm an alchemist, but I'm
more of a spiritual alchemist,

00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:57.650 align:middle line:10%
I would say.

00:57:57.650 --> 00:58:05.240 align:middle line:10%
So I am more about the alchemy
of the self and our own soul,

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:08.060 align:middle line:10%
and yet I do bring the science
in, so physicist and alchemist.

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
that's important.

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.400 align:middle line:90%
