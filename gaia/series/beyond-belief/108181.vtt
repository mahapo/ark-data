00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.110 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.912 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.402 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:10%
You know, the Bible
is broken down

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.910 align:middle line:10%
into two main sections--
the Old Testament

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:10%
and the New Testament.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And on "Beyond
Belief," we're going

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate on this
program on the Old Testament

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
with biblical scholar and
expert Michael Heiser.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Michael, always a pleasure.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL HEISER: Very good.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want
to compliment you

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.631 align:middle line:84%
on the work you've done
for us on our radio show,

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:49.475 align:middle line:90%
"Coast to Coast AM."

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:50.433 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Oh, it's fun.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
it's truly riveting,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:84%
the information that
you bring to us.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.595 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward to
this discussion too.

00:00:56.595 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Yeah.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.011 align:middle line:84%
I'm just glad that I
get a chance to be on.

00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Because, like I said, it's fun.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about the
Old Testament on this program.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Mm-hmm.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My biblical studies
from my catechism classes

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.226 align:middle line:84%
back in Catholic days told
me a lot about Genesis.

00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Explain to us the Old Testament.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: The Old Testament,
our Old Testament anyway,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.207 align:middle line:84%
is 39 books in the
Protestant canon.

00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:26.290 align:middle line:84%
There are different canons,
different collections.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
The word canon just
means collection.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:10%
So it's the sacred
scriptures to Judaism,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:10%
those who would be in ancient
Canaan, the Israelites,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:10%
whatnot.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:10%
Also, of course, to Christians
of all different varieties too.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the collection
that we call the Old Testament

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
sometimes varies
just a little bit

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.567 align:middle line:90%
between Christian denominations.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Old Testament
highlighted a lot

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:90%
on creation and on prophecy.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
In terms of prophecy, what
does it spell out for us?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well, a lot of what
prophets actually did and said

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
is, from our
perspective, history.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And even in their day,
a lot of it was history.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
You can really break it down
into two things that they did.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.767 align:middle line:90%
Prophets would preach.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
would tell people, hey,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
you're not living
according up to God's law.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So they were sort of Covenant
enforcers in that way.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But then they would also
do predictive prophecy.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
They would get
messages from God,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
either symbolically
or orally, by ear,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:90%
or they would see a vision.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And it might be a near
future kind of thing,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:84%
where it would be
fulfilled in a few years

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:90%
or maybe in a few days.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you would get these
remote prophecies that even

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.866 align:middle line:84%
people like us are still
looking for the culmination,

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
the fulfillment,
of those things.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How were these prophets
looked at by the population

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:90%
of that time?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well, I think it's
fair to say they were feared.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes things
would happen in their wake,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.202 align:middle line:84%
There's a passage
that described Samuel,

00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
who was a prophet, as saying,
when he came into town,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:90%
the people trembled.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like, what's
going to happen now?

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's always
bad news, right?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Yeah, he's
going to give bad news.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Something bad might happen.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you get a
guy like Ezekiel.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.864 align:middle line:84%
They thought he was sort
of crazy because God

00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:11.837 align:middle line:90%
had him do crazy things.

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Take off all your clothes.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.929 align:middle line:84%
Lay on your side for
x number of days.

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Talk about your wheel.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.303 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Shave your head.

00:03:17.303 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, do all this sort of stuff.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So some of them were
a spectacle like that,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
but others, again, were
more sort of like ministers,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.669 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
People that would walk around
very respected in the community

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and in many cases, feared.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the
governments of that era

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:90%
react to the prophets?

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.415 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: It depended on
if what they were saying

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
went along with what
you wanted to hear.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah, for instance,
was stationed

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:90%
in the court of the King.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.192 align:middle line:84%
So he was part of
the royal entourage.

00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he could get
away with most things.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.816 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:84%
He had to get
access to the King,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of what he said,
again, was in the King's favor.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you were a prophet
that was sent to a King

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.527 align:middle line:84%
that God didn't
like, then chances

00:04:01.527 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:84%
are what you're going to say is
going to get you into trouble.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of prophets
wound up in prison.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were killed.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.387 align:middle line:84%
So there was a very
hostile relationship too.

00:04:10.387 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who channeled
these prophets?

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who created them?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Was it truly something god-like?

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Or were these frauds
that picked up

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
on just what the pulse
of the community was?

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well, there
were false prophets.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:84%
You get discussion
about false prophets

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and how to tell false prophets
both in the Old and the New

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Testament.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:90%
So you do have frauds.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
If we're talking about
the biblical prophets,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
the idea is someone
who speaks for God.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.035 align:middle line:90%
It's a very old tradition.

00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It even goes back
to Adam and Noah.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
If you were the person
the community looked at

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.440 align:middle line:84%
as being the one who spoke
what God wanted heard

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
by whatever the
audience was, then you

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:90%
were a prophetic figure.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
When we think of
prophets, we think

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
of the sort of big names--
the Isaiah, the Ezekiel,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
big books of the Old
Testament, that sort of thing.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So you could have those
there were, again,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
in concert with the Torah
message, the law message.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you had others that
were claiming things just

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to get a popular audience,
just to have a hearing

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.802 align:middle line:90%
and be famous.

00:05:15.802 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm sure they
pulled that off sometimes.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: They did pull
that off sometimes.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:90%
But usually they were exposed.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
You actually have confrontations
in the Old Testament

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.566 align:middle line:84%
where one prophet would
expose a false prophet.

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would that be
a crime in those days?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Oh yeah.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.315 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was taken
very seriously.

00:05:30.315 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoops.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.209 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: It would've
been something

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:33.777 align:middle line:90%
viewed as blasphemous.

00:05:33.777 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sorry, I
thought the asteroid

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:90%
was coming this week, right?

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Yeah, I mean, usually
because it was so politically

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
entwined that people could
go in and have a message

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and get favor.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But then, you know,
that cuts two ways.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.870 align:middle line:84%
If you go into a situation
and you're a pretender,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're making it up as you
go, and you get a few hits,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.667 align:middle line:84%
you get a few winners, and
then that gets you favor,

00:05:57.667 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:84%
well, then you're looked at as
the person who has the answers.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.906 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: So if you ever
come into a situation

00:06:02.906 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:84%
where you don't have the
answer, then you're in trouble.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing's just uprooted.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, what
is astral prophecy?

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Astral
prophecy is the notion

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that God can
communicate, dispense

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.880 align:middle line:84%
some sort of message either
symbolically or something

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:84%
actually going on in the
heavens to deliver a message not

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
through spoken word but, again,
through signage, celestial

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:90%
signs.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds like astrology.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:90%
It was different than that.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Our concept of
modern astrology is

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:84%
that what goes on in the heavens
determines individual fates

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and individual destinies--
that sort of thing.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
What biblical
astral prophecy is,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.849 align:middle line:84%
is just the idea that there are
things going on the heavens.

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And since God is the one who
created the sun, the moon,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and the stars, and
he created them

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:84%
for times and seasons-- that
comes right out of Genesis--

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:84%
that God is very well capable
of messaging something

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.866 align:middle line:90%
through those celestial objects.

00:07:04.866 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael,
these prophets,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
did they talk about good
things and bad things?

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Yeah, you
get a mixture of both.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of doom and gloom
to what the prophets are doing.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Especially after
the kingdom divides.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
If you know a little bit
about Old Testament history,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
we have Saul, David,
and Solomon who

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:84%
are kings of a unified
country-- all 12 tribes.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And then after the reign of
Solomon, the kingdom splits.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And the kingdom to
the north goes off

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and does their own
religious thing.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:84%
They have their own religious
practices, their own idols

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And so when prophets in
those days, post-Solomon,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.140 align:middle line:84%
would get involved again
politically with kings,

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the message
was negative.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And typically, if you
were sent to the north,

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
God said go up to
the northern kingdom

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.764 align:middle line:84%
and prophesy to so-and-so, it
was going to be a bad message.

00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it was really
going to be about,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:84%
if you don't correct this, if
you don't go back and rejoin

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:84%
the two southern tribes--
and the one in the South

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
was the tribe of David,
the Lion of David, Judah--

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.067 align:middle line:84%
if you don't do that,
this is going to end.

00:08:09.067 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were these all Hebrews?

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: This is
going to end badly.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they all Hebrews?

00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:13.118 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Yeah, initially.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know in 722 BC that the
Northern kingdom, again, the 10

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:84%
tribes that defected
after Solomon died,

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
they were destroyed
by the Assyrians.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Assyrians were
just not nice people.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I refer to them as the
Klingons of the Old Testament.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:29.594 align:middle line:90%
Very nasty.

00:08:29.594 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Even in some of
their own artwork,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.134 align:middle line:84%
they're skinning people
alive and things like this.

00:08:33.134 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:90%
Just brutal.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And God said, look.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.830 align:middle line:84%
This is what I told
you would happen.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.618 align:middle line:84%
And so when the
prophet goes up there,

00:08:39.618 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking about things
like that, hey, you know,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
the Assyrians are the big
empire on the block now.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:84%
They're going to come
down here and clean house,

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:90%
that's not a popular message.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
But after you have
something like that happen,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and the two southern
tribes eventually

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:84%
get conquered by Nebuchadnezzar,
the message is naturally bad.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's also good,
because this situation

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:90%
isn't going to last forever.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.595 align:middle line:90%
God will forgive you.

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
He will bring you
back to the land.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we get these visions
of something grand and glorious,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
the kingdom of God kickstarted
back on Earth again.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Nebuchadnezzar
was from modern day Iraq

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.645 align:middle line:90%
now, right?

00:09:17.645 --> 00:09:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Yeah, he was the
Babylonian king at the time.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:84%
They had displaced or
replaced Assyria eventually

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:84%
in the spectrum
of world history.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And the Southern kingdom
eventually apostasizes, again,

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
becomes disloyal to
the line of David,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:90%
disloyal to the God of Israel.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And the prophets did
the same thing there.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:84%
You keep this up, God's
going to send Nebuchadnezzar.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get your butts
kicked spiritually speaking

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.735 align:middle line:90%
and physically.

00:09:44.735 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to get deported.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.818 align:middle line:84%
He's going to take
you back into Babylon.

00:09:47.818 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Back in Babylon is where you
get prophets like Ezekiel.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.705 align:middle line:84%
And they're not all
in Palestine or Canaan

00:09:54.705 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:90%
or Israel as we think of it.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And Ezekiel's message tends
to be actually fairly positive

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
in a number of places because
he's there with the captives.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And the first
chapter of Ezekiel,

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
the famous throne
chariot, the wheel vision,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
is really all about a message,
a positive theological message

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
for the people who
are captives there.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these prophets
like the modern social day

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.492 align:middle line:84%
networking, where I mean
they just spread the word?

00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: You know, that's
really an astute question.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Because people tend to think
because we have prophets

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and they're listed by
books in the Bible,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
we tend to think that, oh,
when this guy was alive none

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:90%
of these other ones were.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.220 align:middle line:90%
That is not the case.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:84%
You actually have
prophets, their ministries

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:84%
overlap to a
considerable extent.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So there could be five, six
going on at the same time.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
You also had something
called, in the Old Testament,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:90%
the school of the prophets.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is that prophets would
train people to essentially do

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:90%
what they did.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And since most of what they
did was really preaching about,

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
hey, you need to be
loyal to the law of God.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
You need to be loyal to the
King and this kind of thing.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
They would follow the
big prophet around

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and learn, again,
the content of what

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:84%
he was doing, how
he was doing it.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From the
apostles, basically.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.491 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Right, essentially
like a discipleship thing.

00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So you actually had a number
going on at the same time.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These prophecies would
be how far out in advance?

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well, you
could get-- again,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
if you're talking about
prophecies that we think

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:84%
of as the end, where the
Kingdom of God returns to Earth,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.562 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing--

00:11:34.562 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they preached end
times prophecy, didn't they?

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.728 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: We're still
talking about that.

00:11:38.728 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:84%
The thing that projects it
out is a lot of the prophecies

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:84%
that you can tell are projected
way into the future concern

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
things like regathering
the nations of the world

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
under the singular
God of Israel.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of the work I
do is related to something

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.287 align:middle line:90%
called the divine council.

00:11:58.287 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what is that?

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: The divine council
is the heavenly host, God

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:90%
and his heavenly host.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
In biblical
theology, it concerns

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
how that group
administratively runs

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
the affairs of not
only the unseen world

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle line:90%
but the seen world.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Tower of Babel
episode is really crucial

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:84%
in this whole world view,
because Deuteronomy 32:8 says,

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:84%
when the Most High divided
up the nations with Babel,

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
he divided them up according
to number of the sons of God.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's this notion that
God forsakes the nations,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
puts them under
lesser divine beings,

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:90%
under lesser authorities.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the Old
Testament explanation

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:84%
for where you get pantheons
in the ancient world.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Intentionally, right?

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Intentionally.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And then he calls Abraham
and creates a people

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.437 align:middle line:90%
for himself, which is Israel.

00:12:44.437 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So the whole rest
of the Old Testament

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.392 align:middle line:84%
is Israel against the
nations and Israel's God

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
against the other gods.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have these visions
of this whole situation

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.986 align:middle line:90%
being rectified.

00:12:53.986 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is
still all Old Testament.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: This is still
all Old Testament.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'll get Isaiah as
a big prophet for this theme.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
When you spill into the New
Testament, the whole idea

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:84%
of reclaiming the nations,
again establishing

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:84%
a single kingdom
of God on Earth,

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:90%
that begins when Jesus shows up.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And there are indications
in the life of Jesus,

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:84%
even in the birth narrative,
different stories-- where

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
he goes, what he says when
he's there-- that telegraph

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
this message but even he says,
this is still in process.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.324 align:middle line:84%
So it's projected way
out into the future.

00:13:27.324 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the Old
Testament, was there

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
one single prophet who stood
out among all the others?

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Boy, that's
a good question.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I think if you're
talking about prophets

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that are in the Holy Land,
it would probably be Isaiah.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
We have most of his
work, so chances

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
are he's the one who said
the most or at least earliest

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:90%
recorded the most.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he live long?

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.221 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: He lived in
the 8th century BC.

00:13:56.221 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:84%
The Old Testament
doesn't have this,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%
but Jewish tradition
has him being

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:84%
finally killed, sawn in
half, actually put into a log

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.295 align:middle line:90%
and sawed in half.

00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Again, that's--

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By hand?

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: --a
biblical tradition.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But eventually
Isaiah goes-- he's

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:84%
one of the prophets
that gets killed.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, Jesus
would refer to this

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times when he
was in confrontation

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:90%
with the Pharisees.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.148 align:middle line:84%
He would say things
like, look, you

00:14:21.148 --> 00:14:23.122 align:middle line:84%
guys are just-- I'm
just like the prophets.

00:14:23.122 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:90%
You're here to kill me.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
You've killed off how
many prophets now?

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Because they become unpopular.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.285 align:middle line:90%
They are not popular guys.

00:14:30.285 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would a
prophet even consider

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:90%
saying the wrong thing?

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well, when you get
to something like Isaiah,

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and I think this is
actually a pattern that

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:90%
goes all the way back.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned Adam
before, this whole idea

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:84%
of being a spokesperson for
God-- Adam, Noah, Moses,

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Joshua.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Not all those figures
are called prophets,

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
but they all have
one thing in common,

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.099 align:middle line:90%
and that is a divine encounter.

00:14:53.099 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A connection with God.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.348 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: A connection.

00:14:55.348 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:10%
So God comes to them in
some sort of memorable--

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:10%
and I think if
God came to me, it

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.200 align:middle line:10%
would be easy to remember
that day in my life.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's a memorable event,
and they get commissioned.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
God comes to them and says,
I picked you for this task.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bang.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Yeah, so
that's why they do it.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, hey, I don't
want to disobey this encounter

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:20.911 align:middle line:90%
message.

00:15:20.911 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:90%
You even get arguments though.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Moses actually argues
with God about why

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:90%
he shouldn't pick him.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, I can't speak well.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't
want to be picked.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.318 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
go back to Egypt,

00:15:31.318 --> 00:15:34.994 align:middle line:84%
but God more or less assures
him that at the end of the day,

00:15:34.994 --> 00:15:35.910 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be OK.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.951 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be with you.

00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And he gives him,
again, signs to show

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Pharaoh that are miraculous.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:90%
And so Moses quits

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:84%
fighting and goes
back, but it's really

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:90%
about the divine encounter.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain this
connection with God

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:90%
that these prophets had.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything
scientific about it?

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything that
might connect to UFOs?

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Who was this God
that communicated

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:90%
with these individuals?

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: I don't think
there was anything

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:84%
special about the person because
if you look at the personality

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
profiles you get in
the Old Testament,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of backgrounds.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah, again, is a court
personality, sophisticated,

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:84%
knows how to handle himself with
the upper echelons of society.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Some are priests.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.705 align:middle line:90%
Some are farmers.

00:16:25.705 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he's a
like a prosecuting

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.556 align:middle line:90%
attorney or something?

00:16:27.556 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
You have this real
dramatically diverse background

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:90%
for who the prophets were.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's
anything specific to them.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I think the indication
is God's looking

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:84%
for someone who
will do what they're

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.885 align:middle line:84%
asked to do and be
faithful with it

00:16:41.885 --> 00:16:44.886 align:middle line:84%
and trust him to do the
message, even though it's

00:16:44.886 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:90%
going to be very unpopular.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah is a classic
example of this.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.360 align:middle line:84%
God comes to him and says, I
knew you before you were born.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.440 align:middle line:90%
This is your destiny.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:90%
This is what you're going to do.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah doesn't
convince a single person

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.422 align:middle line:90%
in his whole life.

00:16:58.422 --> 00:16:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.713 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Nothing,
he gets no results.

00:17:00.713 --> 00:17:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And God tells him, nobody's
going to listen to you,

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:90%
but this is still your task.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:90%
This is still your job.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.804 align:middle line:84%
He has one guy who's with
him, Baruch, who's a scribe.

00:17:08.804 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he a bad prophet?

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.573 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: No, he was a good one.

00:17:10.573 --> 00:17:11.300 align:middle line:90%
He did his job.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
He winds up getting thrown
into cisterns, in pits,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of stuff happens
to him, but he never gives up.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Again, he's resilient.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:90%
He's honoring the call.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:84%
First chapter of Jeremiah, God
comes to him in human form,

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:26.945 align:middle line:90%
as a man.

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
It even says that we even
have a tactile reference.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The word of the Lord
reached out and touched him.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually
a precursor for what

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you see in the New
Testament with Jesus--

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.176 align:middle line:90%
the idea of the incarnation.

00:17:39.176 --> 00:17:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, you remember
probably this

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
from your catechism
training, but the idea of God

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:90%
becoming man.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
The incarnation
is something new,

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.151 align:middle line:84%
but God showing up looking as
a man is very Old Testament.

00:17:52.151 --> 00:17:54.525 align:middle line:84%
That happens a number of
places, and Jeremiah's situation

00:17:54.525 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:90%
was one of those.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
the message that God

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
tried to convey to the
prophets to pass on to man?

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: I think, ultimately,
if you pull yourself

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:84%
out of the context
of Israelite history,

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.757 align:middle line:84%
because, again, in Jeremiah's
case, it's like, well,

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:84%
in a few years, Nebuchadnezzar's
going to show up,

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:90%
and you're all going to die.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's going
to kill you all.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.369 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: So if you pull
yourself out of that,

00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and you start looking
into the bigger

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:84%
picture, about
eventually there's

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
going to come a time when
the whole Earth will be Eden,

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
this whole restoration
theme, all the nations

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:90%
will be brought back.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.615 align:middle line:90%
Again, this--

00:18:32.615 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good
thing or bad thing?

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.781 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Oh, it's
definitely a good thing.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Because in the stream
of biblical theology,

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
you have to remember in
Genesis, Eden was not the world.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Eden was just a little piece.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A small piece of it.

00:18:43.565 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: A little piece of it.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.990 align:middle line:90%
It has geography.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.724 align:middle line:90%
We know it's not the world.

00:18:47.724 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:90%
But at the end--

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.848 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
think it was where?

00:18:49.848 --> 00:18:50.692 align:middle line:90%
Near the Euphrates?

00:18:50.692 --> 00:18:51.275 align:middle line:90%
On the Tigris?

00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Yeah.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the four
river descriptions,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.431 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be right around
there because two of them

00:18:55.431 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:90%
are identifiable.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's no mistake that
the Book of Revelation

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
ends with the whole
world described as Eden.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's this globalization of
this perfect place, a paradise

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:90%
motif.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.557 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at that,
you pull yourself out

00:19:11.557 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:84%
of just the Israelite context,
it's definitely a good message.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were the
prophets, Michael,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
trying to better mankind or
scare the living daylights out

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.390 align:middle line:90%
of them?

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: There is an element,
a strong social justice element,

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:90%
to the prophets.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things
they railed against if they're

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.595 align:middle line:84%
saying, look, you need to live
according to the laws of God,

00:19:28.595 --> 00:19:30.053 align:middle line:84%
well, a lot of the
laws of God were

00:19:30.053 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:90%
about don't abuse the poor.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Don't abuse people who
are less fortunate.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.984 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't steal.

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
They were like the
commandments, somewhat.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Right, you have
a whole social element.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Really, the law of God
applied to wider society.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the prophets would
pick up on abuses like that.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Amos is probably
the most famous.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:84%
He spends most of
his time talking

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:84%
about how people can't get
justice in legal courts

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
or before the King, really
anywhere, unless they

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:90%
have money.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: And
they're very direct.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle line:90%
People are paying people off.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
You think because
your status, you're

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.440 align:middle line:90%
getting away with this or that.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the way
to run a society

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:90%
and have God approve of it.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:90%
So that was part of his message.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.927 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did people
fear the prophets?

00:20:15.927 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Again, they did.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes things
happened in their wake.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, I used the
example earlier of Samuel.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, here he comes.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Specifically,
it's kind of funny to us.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But you actually read
it, Samuel comes to town,

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.574 align:middle line:90%
the people start trembling.

00:20:31.574 --> 00:20:34.339 align:middle line:84%
Something's going to happen,
otherwise he wouldn't show up.

00:20:34.339 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.463 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And something happened.

00:20:36.463 --> 00:20:38.874 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Yeah, I mean
with enough regularity

00:20:38.874 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:90%
that they got spooked by it.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how did
he know these things?

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: The prophet's message,
really, I think is twofold.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.550 align:middle line:84%
The way I would answer
this is, it's very obvious

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.310 align:middle line:84%
if you're told at one
point in your life

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, you need
to go to the people

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and tell them, again, to
live up to the laws of God.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Live up to the
Covenant relationship

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.366 align:middle line:90%
that God has with you.

00:20:58.366 --> 00:21:01.094 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did they all know
what the laws of God were?

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: That was
the priesthood.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The responsibility
of the priests

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.060 align:middle line:90%
was to disseminate that.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.225 align:middle line:84%
Because I think what
you're angling for here

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
is that they didn't
all have bibles.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.700 align:middle line:84%
How'd they know
what the rules were?

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.991 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: They don't have
any of this written material.

00:21:12.991 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of this is
again orally handed out.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Oxymoron there, but either
it's dispensed by the priests

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and then to the heads
of the families.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.131 align:middle line:84%
The fathers are supposed
to teach their children.

00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And again, in oral culture,
this is very common.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:90%
So the prophets know that stuff.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand, they
don't have to be told that.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But when you get into
predictive prophecy,

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:84%
again, they either have
divine encounters or visions.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:84%
God gives them
information on the spot,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:90%
or gives it to them in a dream.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And they wake up
thinking God said, well,

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.080 align:middle line:84%
now go tell this to so-and-so
what you just saw here.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:90%
So it's a mix of both.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The prophets
of the past, what

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:90%
happened to them eventually?

00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is pre-Jesus,
but did they stop?

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Or did the prophecies continue?

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: This is
actually a hot button

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:84%
issue between what goes
on between the testaments

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:90%
especially.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned early on that
there are some books that

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
are considered sacred
in some traditions that

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:90%
get put in the Old Testament.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Some would be in the
Protestant Old Testament,

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.047 align:middle line:84%
and the Catholic Old Testament
would have a little bit

00:22:28.047 --> 00:22:29.130 align:middle line:90%
of a different collection.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would be
different-- close but different.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Close but different.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.230 align:middle line:90%
There are additions there.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And those additions
come from this period.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a sense
for a lot of people living

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.710 align:middle line:84%
in between what we think of
as the Testaments, roughly 500

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.191 align:middle line:90%
BC on to about 1st century AD.

00:22:48.191 --> 00:22:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't seem
that long ago, does it?

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: It doesn't, but it is.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But there is this sense that
this kind of activity, God

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.380 align:middle line:84%
still needs people to speak
for him that this is going on.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the material
that people were writing,

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and again, they're
preaching, then

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:84%
that's getting written
down, was considered sacred

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
by different portions
of the Jewish community.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
Dead Sea Scrolls

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:84%
you will actually have books
other than the Old Testament

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:84%
that are quoted as
though they are sacred.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:84%
There are formulaic
ways of quoting things,

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:84%
like if I'm an Old
Testament, or a Qumran scribe

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:84%
living in the Qumran community,
if I wanted to quote scripture,

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I would say "thus says the
Lord," or "as it is written"--

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:90%
these little expressions.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.707 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it shall be?

00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right, so it shall be.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One of my favorites.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Again, little
formulaic things.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.686 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes other
books that aren't in,

00:23:43.686 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:84%
again, the Protestant Old
Testament are quoted that way.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that gives you
a little indication.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And scholars, there are
people who focus specifically

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.609 align:middle line:90%
on this topic.

00:23:52.609 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It gives you an
indication that there

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:84%
were books out there
that were considered very

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.664 align:middle line:90%
high in sacred status as well.

00:23:58.664 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
talk about Ezekiel,

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:84%
seeing that he lived
during this time period.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.430 align:middle line:84%
What is your interpretation,
Michael, of Ezekiel's wheel?

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.664 align:middle line:90%
It's a bizarre story.

00:24:07.664 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: It is.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a classic
example of astral prophecy.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.212 align:middle line:84%
What you have in Ezekiel
Chapter 1-- and lots of people

00:24:18.212 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:90%
are familiar with this.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
You have God seated
on the throne,

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.836 align:middle line:90%
and the throne has a platform.

00:24:23.836 --> 00:24:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath
the platform,

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:84%
you have these four
creaturely figures

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:84%
that are called cherubim,
actually, in Chapter 10.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be
engines, you know?

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: They have four
faces, and the four faces, not

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
coincidentally I
think, correspond

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:84%
to the cardinal
points of the zodiac,

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Babylonians' zodiac.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's a classic
astral prophecy picture.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:84%
We actually know
what they saw because

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.056 align:middle line:84%
of the statuary, the iconography
that comes from Babylon

00:24:53.056 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:90%
in Ezekiel's own day.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They did
witness something, right?

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.746 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:24:55.746 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:90%
So they carve it.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:84%
We know what the
cherubim look like.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.260 align:middle line:84%
We know what the
faces look like.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:84%
But the real issue
is what does it mean?

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Because why would an
Old Testament prophet

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:12.200 align:middle line:84%
use constellations, zodiac
symbolism, in a prophecy

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.200 align:middle line:90%
about the God of Israel?

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.699 align:middle line:84%
Because this isn't
the sort of thing

00:25:14.699 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that you associate with the
Bible, this astral thinking.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And the messaging is
actually pretty simple.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.409 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel and any
faithful Israelite

00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
is going to believe because
of Genesis that God created

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:84%
the sun, moon, stars in their
courses for times and seasons,

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.369 align:middle line:84%
passages of epochs and
all that sort of thing.

00:25:34.369 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And so the assumption was that,
well, if he created all that,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:90%
God controls that.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And since those
things do mark time,

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that's an indication that
God is the force behind what

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:90%
happens as time passes on.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And so to put the God of
Israel on the throne instead

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
of the Babylonian
god who should have

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
been on the throne
of his own symbolism,

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.610 align:middle line:84%
to put the God of Israel on
that throne with the four

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.410 align:middle line:84%
cardinal points of
the Babylonian zodiac,

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.420 align:middle line:90%
the message is pretty clear.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The gods of Babylon are not
the ones running this show.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we know that
we're in Babylon.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:90%
We were taken captive.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.890 align:middle line:90%
We're prisoners.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It's really bad,
but it's not going

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:84%
to stay this way because their
gods aren't the ones in control

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:90%
of the circumstances.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Really, it's the God of Israel.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it's
theological messaging.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And so much of prophecy,
especially astral prophecy--

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you don't
think the wheel was a UFO?

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: No, I don't
think the wheels are UFOs.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Because they're on the ground.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.374 align:middle line:90%
They're vertical.

00:26:31.374 --> 00:26:32.665 align:middle line:90%
They're attached to the throne.

00:26:32.665 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:90%
It turns around.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.930 align:middle line:84%
We actually get the same
image in Daniel, Chapter 7.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize that Daniel
7 uses the same throne image.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it something though?

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Yeah, it's actually
called a throne, a seat.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And the crazy thing about
Daniel is that you have plural.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It says the thrones,
plural, were set.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to become fodder.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:84%
That chapter in Ezekiel
1 becomes fodder

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.990 align:middle line:84%
for something known as
Merkava mysticism in Judaism.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've heard of that.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: The word Merkava
means "flying throne chariot."

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So it comes right out
of these two chapters.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.215 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a lot of
texts-- and a lot of them

00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:18.760 align:middle line:84%
are in the Dead Sea Scrolls--
about these divine throne

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:84%
room visions, where you not only
have God seated on the throne,

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.467 align:middle line:84%
but you have other beings
seated on their own thrones.

00:27:25.467 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you could see
how people would interpret it

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:90%
as something extraterrestrial.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Oh sure.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Sure, that's easy for us
because, again, we have

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:90%
a modern technological context.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:84%
We have the context of,
again, lots of these stories.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.596 align:middle line:84%
So when we read Ezekiel
it's very easy, again, to--

00:27:39.596 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To put that into--

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Right, to superimpose
the two things, yeah.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like fallen
angels and ETs, same kind.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did God really
make everything in six days

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.029 align:middle line:90%
and then rest up?

00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: The way I
would answer this is, I

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.610 align:middle line:90%
don't think it really matters.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's going
to draw a lot of ire

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.360 align:middle line:84%
from people in the
audience, but my view

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:84%
is that Genesis is really
about theological messaging.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:90%
It affirms a creator.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:84%
This is a
pre-scientific culture.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it accurate?

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Oh, I think it's
accurate to the extent of what

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.159 align:middle line:90%
it claims scientifically.

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
For instance, Genesis,
what it really

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:84%
claims is that the world we
know, Heaven and Earth we know,

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.300 align:middle line:90%
had a beginning.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:90%
It didn't cause itself.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:84%
It had to have an
external cause.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just there.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:31.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not spontaneous
generation of matter.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:10%
Those kinds of big ideas
do conform very nicely

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.574 align:middle line:10%
to modern science.

00:28:35.574 --> 00:28:37.240 align:middle line:10%
But the people who
wrote this are living

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.574 align:middle line:10%
in the second Millennium BC.

00:28:38.574 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How would
they know this?

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.320 align:middle line:10%
>>HEISER: Right, they're not
going to know the details,

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:10%
the niceties of
modern cosmology,

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:10%
modern science, for instance.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The Old Testament expresses
the locus of emotion

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.830 align:middle line:90%
and thought not in the brain.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:84%
There is no biblical Hebrew word
for brain, believe it or not.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's a
pre-scientific culture.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes or no--
were the prophets

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.555 align:middle line:90%
accurate during this era?

00:29:05.555 --> 00:29:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Yeah, I think
the prophets were accurate.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:90%
History bears them out.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't really
have a clear instance

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:90%
of a prophet being wrong.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:84%
That was actually the test
of a prophet-- were you

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.804 align:middle line:90%
accurate or not?

00:29:17.804 --> 00:29:19.220 align:middle line:84%
The assumption
was, if you're not,

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:90%
you can't be speaking for God.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Because God should know
what's going to happen.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:90%
He tells you the way it is.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Michael, thanks for being

>>HEISER: You're welcome.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is fascinating.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:84%
That was, of course,
the Old Testament.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:10%
In our next program, The
New Testament and what

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:10%
does that hold?

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."
