00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.008 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.672 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.524 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:10%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:10%
And in this edition, my
guest is Dr. Raymond Moody,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:10%
noted author, of course,
"Life After Life,"

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:10%
as we talk about what
is on the other side.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like a
dream state, isn't it?

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:10%
>>RAYMOND MOODY: You know,
it's interesting, George.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:10%
That's the naturally
occurring metaphor,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:10%
is like it's a dream state.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:10%
However, what
people will tell you

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:10%
who have had these
near death experiences

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:10%
is that it's exactly
the opposite.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:84%
What they say is when
your heart stops beating

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and you get out
of your body, it's

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.295 align:middle line:84%
kind of like you feel like
you're waking up from a dream,

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that this is the dream,
that the reality you enter

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:84%
into at that point
is hyper real,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.994 align:middle line:90%
people say, more real than real.

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people have been

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
through these tragic
occurrences where

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
they have this near-death
experience-- they

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:90%
don't want to come back.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:84%
People say, I just
didn't want to come back.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Usually people are told
they have to go back.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
There's something
you got left to do.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Or they're given the choice.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, you
can either stay here

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
or you can go back to the
life you've been leading.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And not too surprisingly,
all the ones I know

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:90%
chose to come back.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But the reason they
do is invariably

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of someone else.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:90%
They say that--

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They know
they have to come back.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, for
me, I wanted to stay,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
but I had to go back because
I had young children left

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.687 align:middle line:84%
to raise, is the most
common thing they'll say.

00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
The movie "Poltergeist" --
that little lady would say,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:90%
don't go into the light.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Don't go into the light.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I guess she was trying to tell
them, you go into the light,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:90%
you're not coming back, right?

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: You're not coming back.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.451 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people see this light

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.134 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the tunnel
in these experiences?

00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, you know what
we have with these near death

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:90%
experiences is like a spectrum.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
There's about, say,
15 common elements,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
including the things
we know, like hearing

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:84%
that wah-wah-wah sound,
leaving the body,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
going through a passageway,
entering out into a world

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that, no matter how articulate
they may be, George,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:84%
or how many degrees or however
many languages they speak,

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
they say they just have
no words to describe this.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But they say they come
into this amazing light.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.969 align:middle line:84%
They see relatives or friends
of theirs who have passed away.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's comforting.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.843 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Comforting.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
As panoramic memory, see
everything you've ever done.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And what tends to
happen is, not everybody

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:84%
gets the whole,
full-blown picture.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people may see one or
two or three of these things.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Others five or six or seven.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, you have people
who see the whole 15 elements.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And it correlates very
nicely as a general rule

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
with how close
they got to death.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Like if your cardiac
arrest is only momentary,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
you're more likely to report
two or three of these things.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if it's one of these
things that's impossibly long,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
like 40-minute cardiac arrest
or two-hour cardiac arrest,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
then they will tell you more
likely this whole thing.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's variable.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder what someone
like Ariel Sharon, who has just

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
passed away, former Prime
Minister of Israel who

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:84%
was in a coma for so
many years, when you're

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of coma state,
I wonder if he's dreaming,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
if his mind is active,
or if it's just nothing.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I had something happen
to me in medical school--

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
or, happened to a lady
that was the patient.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it was
really a revelation.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.730 align:middle line:84%
We were going to see this
woman who was comatose.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
And every day when we
went in there, there

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
were the people from her church
were sitting around the bed.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And they were reading
her the Bible.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we thought
that was so touching.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:90%
We really did.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we
would leave the room,

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
we would just say, well,
those people are so sweet.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But our idea was that
there was no point to it,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:90%
because she was comatose.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day after
a couple of months

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
of this with her in the
coma, we went in there

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.565 align:middle line:84%
and she was sitting
up in bed talking.

00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:10%
And you know, the
first thing she

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:10%
said to us was, well,
if it hadn't been

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:10%
for those people coming by to
read the Bible to me every day,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:10%
I would have gone crazy.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:90%
So you just never can tell.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never know.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.899 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I've had
people tell me that when

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
they were in the
comatose state, they

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:84%
were going in and
out of their body.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some after death
experiences on an operating

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
table, people have seen
their doctor talking

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
to the attendant,
laughing, giggling maybe.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And they've come
back, and they've

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
told the attending
physician, why

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
were you laughing when you were
ready to perform that surgery?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.824 align:middle line:90%
And they're in shock.

00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just hear this
from people all the time,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
not just there in the
scene of the resuscitation,

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
but people will
tell you that they

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:84%
left their body and the whole
room of the operating room

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and went out into other
parts of the hospital.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And they can sometimes
relate to you

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
what their relatives
out in the waiting room

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:90%
were talking about and so on.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do not talk
a lot about "the devil."

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, you
know, George, I've

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
got to say this-- I
think that, number one,

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
people want to hear
about negative near death

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And I would be happy
to talk about it

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:84%
if I could put much
information together on it.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, there are so few.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
According to the Gallup
survey that was done in '79,

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:84%
it was either 0.3% or 3% of the
cases of near death experiences

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:90%
are negative.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And so it's much easier
to study a big number

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.550 align:middle line:90%
than it is a small number.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:10%
And also, the negative
ones tend to be spread out.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.210 align:middle line:10%
They are a lot less homogeneous
than the positive ones were.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.834 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you mean by
negative, what does that mean?

00:06:54.834 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, that
people experience it

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
as a dysphoric event,
as a terrible thing

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:90%
or frightening or horrible.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
uncomfortable, all right.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And there's about
three different types

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:90%
of negative ones.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And the smallest
percentage of those

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
are the ones where people
actually see hellish things.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's all kinds of
complications with that.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.240 align:middle line:84%
There may be an under
reporting factor.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.550 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
can easily imagine

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that if I had a hellish
near-death experience,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.524 align:middle line:84%
I might be less likely to
say, oh doc, when I died,

00:07:24.524 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:90%
I went to hell, right?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I just don't
have the informational basis

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.359 align:middle line:84%
to make a judgment about
devils and things like that.

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they real, though?

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Because we hear about demons.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:90%
We hear about exorcisms.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I would have to
address that hypothetically.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And what I would say
is that I've never

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
been so much concerned about
what we call in philosophy

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
"the problem of evil,"
which is the idea

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:84%
that if God is benevolent and
all loving and all powerful,

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:90%
then how can there be a devil?

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember reading
as an undergraduate something

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:84%
in "Faust" -- or I think it was
"Faust," but it was Goethe--

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
that really sort of made me
see that in a different way.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And what the picture there is
that yeah, there's a devil.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And that God sometimes does let
the devil get hold of somebody

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:84%
but that God has all of
the pathways covered,

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
so that the only possible
outcome of someone getting

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
in the clutches of the devil
was that it would drive them

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:90%
right back to God.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.975 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a
devil, then it's

00:08:35.975 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
a little-- it's an added
feature in the drama, I guess.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:90%
But it's still a drama.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
In 1967 in Charlottesville,
I was in graduate school.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:10%
And we went to all
the entertainment

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:10%
there at UVA, because
our best friend

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.810 align:middle line:10%
was the guy who arranged
for all the entertainment.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.440 align:middle line:10%
And we got the best seats.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:10%
We were on the front row.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:10%
And there was this
Broadway musical comedy

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:10%
that came through.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And I really noticed
something that's

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
really been a major
impact on me ever since.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was that
this musical comedy

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
had a great comic villain,
complete with the black hat

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:90%
and the black cape and so on.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So then when the show was
over and all the actors

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and actresses came out
for their curtain call,

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.097 align:middle line:84%
the hero and heroine
came out and it was, yay!

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everyone's going crazy.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then all the
supporting actors and actresses

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:90%
and, yay, everybody's cheering.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the villain came
out, and there was silence.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:35.694 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they boo?

00:09:35.694 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what to do.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: They didn't boo,
they just were silent.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
But then, it was so
interesting to me

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:84%
since I was in the first--
the front of the room.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I could hear that process
where everybody kind of woke

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:90%
up and said, oh, it's a show.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And then-- [CLAPPING]

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.708 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then they applauded.

00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
He did a good job
at what he did.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I have come around
to think, George,

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.555 align:middle line:90%
that Elie Wiesel remember him?

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he said, "God
made man because He--"

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:90%
capital H-e-- "loves stories."

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And after I made this
sort of realization

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:84%
about a year and a half
ago that oh, my god,

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:84%
there is a life
after death, then I

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
began to think, well, then
what's this all about?

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And what
I've come to think

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
is that Elie Wiesel
was right, that this

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of narrative
framework that we're in.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
what is a human being's

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
life except for that
person's story, right?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think that these are lives
that we're living through,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and at the risk of sounding
psychotic to your viewers

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
here, which is
all right with me,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
but I'm beginning
to think that this

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
is God's educational and
entertainment medium that we're

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:84%
in, and we're here for a
time, we go through this life.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:10%
And then as I began to
tell, at least on the word

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:10%
of my children,
who've assured me,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:10%
that then you just sort of
pop into some other life

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:10%
after you get finished
with this one.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So reincarnation
is a strong possibility.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: You know, I've always
been interested in it from

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:84%
the point of view -- I think
there's so many mythologies

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
about reincarnation in the
West, which I was attuned

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:90%
to as a philosophy student.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Because what people tell you
about the reincarnation idea

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
was, oh, it was imported into
the West in the 19th century

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:84%
by Madame Blavatsky
and people like that.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:90%
But no way, George.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's been around
for a long, long time.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Pythagoras
claimed to remember

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:10%
eight of his past lives.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Plato was a
reincarnationist, Empedocles,

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:90%
the Greek philosopher.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So it was very firmly
in the Western tradition

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ancient India--
strong believers.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.133 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:52.132 align:middle line:84%
And even in the West,
it's always been around.

00:11:52.132 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I've always
thought that reincarnation

00:11:54.330 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
was the act of becoming
perfect, that we would come back

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to be better than we were
in our previous life.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And I always used
to tell people,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:84%
the mere fact that we're sitting
around talking about this means

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:90%
we've reached a certain stage.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:90%
We're at another level already.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:84%
But I would think that
someone who is a murderer

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:84%
or has performed evil
like that, they're

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom of this
echelon of growth,

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:84%
but that eventually they get
better, and they get better,

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:90%
and they get better.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: You know, what
people tell me who almost die

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and return, especially in
these extreme near-death

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.574 align:middle line:90%
experiences--

00:12:36.574 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there are many.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes, are there ever.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And that they have a review
in which every single action

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
they've ever done is displayed
around them instantaneously

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
in a full-color,
three-dimensional, holographic

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.770 align:middle line:90%
panorama.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And they say that in this
panorama, when you see yourself

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
doing each action of your
life, that you don't re-witness

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that action through the eyes
you had when you were doing it.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Rather that you are
empathically embedded

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:84%
in the consciousness of those
with whom you've interacted.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you see yourself doing
something mean to someone, then

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.159 align:middle line:84%
when that action has
its consequence--

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, and it does.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: --you are that person.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.235 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it does.

00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:25.504 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: What better solution?

00:13:25.504 --> 00:13:27.170 align:middle line:10%
If you try to think
of this abstractly--

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I couldn't design it.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: No, me, neither.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:10%
It's just perfect.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:10%
It's the way I like
to say it-- let's

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:10%
forget the idea of an
afterlife for a moment.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And as a logician, I love
to make minimal inferences,

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
like what's the
minimal thing you

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:84%
can infer about this that you're
absolutely safe in inferring?

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And let's think
about these reviews

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:90%
of your life for a minute.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, quite apart from the
afterlife, what these life

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
reviews plainly
mean is that life--

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.120 align:middle line:84%
and think about
this for a moment--

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:84%
that life is a
two-phase process.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:10%
Apparently, first
we live it forward

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:10%
as the actor or protagonist.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But then at the end,
we switch around

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and we re-witness
the same action

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
from the point of view
of the other characters.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Now what better system is that?

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have got to
be a believer in intuition

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and psychic capabilities.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that as
strongly as you believe

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:84%
in life after death,
there's something

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:84%
else out there that
we're tapping into.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you yourself,
Raymond, had intuitive thoughts

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:38.960 align:middle line:90%
and things happen?

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I have,
and how interesting.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a professor
of epistemology.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Before I went to medical school,
I was a Ph.D in philosophy,

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and I was a
philosophy professor.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Epistemology, or the
theory of knowledge,

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:90%
was one of my specialties.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, and you know,
it's so fascinating to me

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that I am such a rationalist
all my life, George.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.561 align:middle line:84%
I had two doctoral degrees
before I was 31 years old.

00:15:02.561 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Plus three
of those years

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I'd been a philosophy professor.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Now at our age, and I know
you're younger than me,

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:84%
but we're in that
same slot, now we

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
can understand there's something
terribly wrong with that,

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And there was.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:10%
I spent my whole life
with my nose in a book.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:25.650 align:middle line:10%
And despite teaching
epistemology,

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:10%
I never really thought
much about intuition.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
But just in the last
couple of weeks,

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.214 align:middle line:84%
I've been thinking about
this intuition thing.

00:15:34.214 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah,
because you see, I've

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:84%
realized that there's no
rational way that you can lead

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
yourself, that you can go
in a clear, rigorous process

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.500 align:middle line:84%
under current logical
standards that you

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
can go to to reach the
conclusion that there's

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:90%
life after death.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.107 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, I've
realized there is.

00:15:53.107 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: OK?

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.005 align:middle line:84%
And so what that
means is there's

00:15:56.005 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:84%
something needs to be
tightened up about the logic.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
to make it sloppy.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean to make it
even more rigorous.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:10%
And I think you're right,
that intuition is--

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:10%
and very important, I've had
things happen to me in my life

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:10%
that I absolutely knew
that I had absolutely

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.390 align:middle line:10%
no way of knowing and yet
turned out to be correct.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I always use
my automobile story.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And you don't like
automobiles, but I

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.920 align:middle line:84%
was driving through an
intersection, right?

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And I've got the green light.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.830 align:middle line:90%
So I go.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Something is telling me before
I get to that intersection,

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
don't go through.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it, George.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't go through.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:84%
It was the weirdest
feeling I've had.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, I've
got cars behind me.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
I can't just stop.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:90%
So I'll pull over.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:90%
So I pulled over.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I did not go through
the green light.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:84%
At that point, at
that very point

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
that I would have been in the
middle of the intersection,

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:84%
some guy has gone
through his red light.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And he just zoomed
right through.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:90%
I would have been right there.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.085 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
broad sided on my side.

00:17:04.085 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yikes.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it
that clicked in me,

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that saw this in the
future by a couple seconds

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and was so compelling that
it told me, don't do this?

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Is it a mechanism that we
have as living beings that

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:90%
has like radar out there?

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Or is it more supernatural?

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, you know, I
had that similar experience

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.510 align:middle line:90%
in about 1970.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was the spring of
'70, the end of the quarter.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'd given a final exam.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And the students were
coming out of the class.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And as this one
young woman-- I'm

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
sorry to say than in
a class of 60 kids,

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily
know everybody.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But this one young lady was
coming out of the class--

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and, George, I
don't know, I mean,

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
it was really kind of
embarrassing to me.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I had to say it.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But as this child, as she was
then, walked by, I said, look,

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.737 align:middle line:84%
you've got to be very
careful around motorcycles.

00:18:05.737 --> 00:18:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just out of
the blue you said that.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Just out of the blue.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:90%
And I was embarrassed.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what was that all about?

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Well then, I just really
sort of forgot about it.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.410 align:middle line:90%
I went, what was that?

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:84%
The following fall, that
young woman came back to me

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and she said, "Dr. Moody,"
she said, "a couple of months

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
after that, I met
this guy at the beach

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:90%
who was a motorcycle guy."

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "I was
riding on his motorcycle,

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and we were going
down the street,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly what you
said came back to me.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said, stop, stop, stop.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And he stopped.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.896 align:middle line:84%
And right around the next
curve was this horrific crash."

00:18:44.896 --> 00:18:45.396 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:18:45.396 --> 00:18:46.479 align:middle line:90%
They would have been dead.

00:18:46.479 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: But you
know, at the time,

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:84%
it was really
embarrassing to me.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I still-- it's kind
of embarrassing.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.887 align:middle line:90%
Because I do--

00:18:52.887 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's out of
character for you to do that.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, it is.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I am-- logic is--
some people say, oh, Raymond,

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.461 align:middle line:90%
you worship reason.

00:19:01.461 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: There's a
lot of things in life

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.700 align:middle line:90%
that don't correspond to reason.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But I figure that number
one, logic is fun.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:84%
The reason I like logic is
that if you go by the rules,

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.402 align:middle line:84%
then you get a pretty much
good approximation of what is.

00:19:17.402 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You must have loved
it when Spock would say,

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:20.575 align:middle line:10%
it's illogical.

00:19:20.575 --> 00:19:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just fun,
logic-- reasoning correctly.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you just try to think
of what you want to believe

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and then you throw some
crummy argument after it,

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that's self-deception,
and it's never satisfying.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you commit yourself
to going through the process

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:84%
rigorously, then
you can be satisfied

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
with the answer that
comes out at the end.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, it's too bad
that most of our politicians

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:90%
don't think logically.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't think
these things through.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, they don't

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't look at
the ramifications of what

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.144 align:middle line:90%
this event will do to us at all.

00:19:56.144 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: It's pretty
disturbing, George,

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you're in the
same situation as I am.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:90%
You don't worry for you.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.265 align:middle line:84%
I don't worry for me, but
we worry for our kids.

00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For everybody else
and the people we care about.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Where does life after death
go from here, Raymond?

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where are
the further studies?

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Who's out there?

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there aren't a
lot of Raymond Moodys

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:90%
out there doing what you do.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, George, I can
be forthcoming and tell you

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:90%
what the truth is.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.822 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm satisfied that--

00:20:28.822 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've always
done that with me.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Exactly,
and at the same time,

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
this is just going to sound
impossibly abstruse right now.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.490 align:middle line:90%
But this is the outlines of it.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
The greatest skeptic there
ever was probably in the West

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.650 align:middle line:84%
after the Greeks was
David Hume, remember

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:84%
the causation guy, 1711
to 1776, the arch skeptic.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "By the
mere light of reason,

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
it seems difficult to prove
the immortality of the soul.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Some new species of logic is
requisite for that purpose

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and some new
faculties of the mind

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:84%
that they may enable us
to comprehend that logic."

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And David Hume
was exactly right.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.026 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was right.

00:21:15.026 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: So we need a
new system of logic.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm confident
in telling you,

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
George, is that we now
have that new logic that

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:84%
enables us to think
in a genuinely

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:84%
rigorously rational way about
the afterlife in entirely

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
new ways, and that
plugging that in, we

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:84%
are going to be able
now to pre-equip people

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:84%
with a new logic such
that when, just by chance,

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:84%
subsequently they have
a near-death experience,

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:84%
they will have entirely new
rational and linguistic tools

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
for describing that
experience to us.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
research is going now.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.470 align:middle line:84%
The trouble with it is
that what draws people

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.430 align:middle line:84%
to this, as you and I know,
are the wonderful stories.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But the concepts are a harder
thing for people to enjoy.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.770 align:middle line:90%
But that's where it's heading.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:84%
We're now actually going to
be able to pre-equip people

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:84%
to articulate and to describe
profound spiritual experiences

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:21.525 align:middle line:84%
in a new way and to overcome
that indescribability barrier

00:22:21.525 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:90%
that people talk about.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will
younger people grasp

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.540 align:middle line:84%
this in this era of
social networking?

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.449 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, yeah.

00:22:29.449 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, will
they pick up on this?

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.073 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Absolutely.

00:22:32.073 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or are they into
the zombie apocalypse?

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.053 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Absolutely.

00:22:35.053 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And if I could just sort of
sketch it out, what it is.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The way logic
developed was Plato

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
formulated the notion of
the true-false distinction

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and predicated it on the
literal domain of meaning.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the next generation,
his student Aristotle,

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.485 align:middle line:84%
who codified the logic that you
and I are using right now when

00:22:55.485 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking about things,
made that the basis of logic.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But Plato was also
realizing that there

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:84%
was a third
possibility, and that

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:84%
is the area of the
unintelligible.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:90%
For example, listen to this.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:84%
"Twas brillig, and
the slithy toves

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:84%
did gyre and gimble
in the wabe."

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Or listen to this, "Holiness
pursues the vestigial lipstick

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.440 align:middle line:90%
of spontaneity."

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Or listen to this, "When
you're doing this experiment,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.795 align:middle line:84%
if you smell an odorless
gas, it is carbon monoxide."

00:23:28.795 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.378 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, there's
three different patterns

00:23:31.378 --> 00:23:33.570 align:middle line:90%
of unintelligibility right now.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: What I can tell
you-- and I'll send you

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:10%
my book on this, and
you will see that we now

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:10%
have a logic of
unintelligibility.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And the classic objection
to the afterlife question

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.940 align:middle line:84%
is that it's
unintelligible, right?

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Because to say there
is life after death,

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.885 align:middle line:84%
if you look up the words, is
a self contradiction, right?

00:23:55.885 --> 00:23:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right there.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.343 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: It just
means-- that's right.

00:23:58.343 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So that now we have a
way of overcoming that.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that that's where
the research is going to go,

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:90%
I think, very soon.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:84%
It will kind of maybe lose the
public a little at that point.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Because naturally what
people want to hear

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:84%
are the stories, which
are very inspiring.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But to actually
solve the problem,

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get away from
the narrative side a little bit

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:90%
and think through some concepts.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But then once you do
that, there are entirely

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
new ways that open
up to investigate

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:90%
the afterlife question.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.854 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are
universities looking

00:24:30.854 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:84%
at this, the study
of life after death?

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.619 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Some of them.

00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a lot.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.246 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Not a lot, no.

00:24:39.246 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't think so.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.225 align:middle line:10%
We don't have the Duke
University Rhine programs

00:24:44.225 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:10%
anymore.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.990 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Yeah, and
you know, George,

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:10%
just to be frank, as you
and I always have been,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:10%
I kind of get that.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as you know, I'm
not a parapsychologist.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
a pseudo science.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.314 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People mistake
the belief with life

00:24:59.314 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:84%
after death as a
parapsychology, and it's not.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: No, yeah, I'm just
not a parapsychologist.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that in
2014, or the 21st century,

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that science is not
yet equipped to address

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:90%
the afterlife question.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
But in the future, I
think it may well be.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.630 align:middle line:90%
What about instruments, tools?

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:24.440 align:middle line:84%
People talk about how their dead
grandmother indeed called them

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.280 align:middle line:90%
after she had died.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh my God, I know.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:90%
That's just so amazing to me.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does this happen?

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.669 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And I know
that it happens.

00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I've had very serious people
tell me things like this.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.897 align:middle line:84%
And I just have resolved
not to think about it.

00:25:35.897 --> 00:25:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Caller ID,
0000 or something.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And I figure-- I always
counsel people, though.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
If you get a call
from the afterlife,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.990 align:middle line:84%
don't take a collect
call from the afterlife.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, you
don't want it collect.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: It's like
a billion dollars.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But sometimes
they'll get a call,

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.750 align:middle line:90%
and it will be a crackle.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes, yes.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I
don't think about that

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:84%
is that I don't
have the equipment.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like if somebody
tells me that they

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:84%
hear their dead relative through
the telephone, I just figure--

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:84%
or that they make a photograph,
and there's orbs or whatever,

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I can't make a judgment
on that, because I

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:90%
don't know about cameras.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Or my son, who's 15, has to
turn on the DVD player for me.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:21.922 align:middle line:90%
So for me--

00:26:21.922 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
not Mr. Mechanical.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It could be, but I
just-- I have no way

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.544 align:middle line:84%
of making an
inference about that.

00:26:27.544 --> 00:26:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something's
going on out there.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, too many people
have seen these things.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.326 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Some odd things-- one
I do hear all the time from

00:26:33.326 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:84%
people, and I just-- and this
is not in the public domain,

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.320 align:middle line:84%
so then I know that this is
something that occurs to people

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:84%
who are grieving, that all
the time I get people who come

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:49.400 align:middle line:84%
to me for grief counseling who
say that after my aunt died

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.574 align:middle line:84%
or my mother or whatever, that
the TV would come on and off--

00:26:53.574 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, exactly.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --or the
light switch, in a way

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that they had never
experienced before.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So I take that seriously,
too, but also I'm

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:84%
fully aware that I don't have
the intellectual equipment

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:90%
for figuring out what it is.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
believe in ghosts,

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.620 align:middle line:84%
if you believe in
life after death?

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: George, I've been
on a couple of haunting

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:84%
investigations, and I was
just really taken along to be

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
the person there not
to participate, but--

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just to witness, right?

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:26.493 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:27:26.493 --> 00:27:29.595 align:middle line:84%
And I just went into
it thinking that, oh,

00:27:29.595 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
brother, what have
I gotten into?

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hooey, right?

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: But yeah, I got to
admit I experienced stuff.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I experienced
something also one time

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:84%
with a dear friend
of mine who was

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.860 align:middle line:84%
one of the most brilliant
people I ever knew.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:84%
He was simultaneously
research director

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:84%
at a major US engineering
school and also simultaneously

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.587 align:middle line:84%
professor of business
at another university.

00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this was his
hobby, this other stuff?

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, he was
just incredibly brilliant.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:84%
He designed the release
mechanism of the Saturn V.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: He worked on the--

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.393 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Off the gantries?

00:28:05.393 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, the stealth
bomber, a lot of that stuff.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And he had a
difficulty one time.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story
short, he came to me

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and I saw something
leave his body.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know, what
can I do, George?

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know it sounds
crazy, but my only other option

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:90%
is lying, right?

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:28.966 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:28:28.966 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: To say that no, I-- but
I have seen things like this.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:84%
But I also realize I don't
have the mental equipment

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:90%
to process that.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Too many
people have witnessed

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.320 align:middle line:84%
too many strange things, whether
it's these life after death

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.570 align:middle line:84%
episodes that you've
been writing about,

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:84%
or my grandmother visited
me after she died.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Or even my cat-- I saw
its paw prints on my bed.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, Raymond,
out there, it's fascinating.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Plato had
a great metaphor.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:84%
He said that our
situation of the world

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.360 align:middle line:84%
is that we are
horses with blinders.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
pretty much what it it.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:08.471 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:29:08.471 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:84%
People want to get a hold
of you or look at your work,

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:90%
where do they go?

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, great.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:18.180 align:middle line:10%
How about RaymondMoodyNDE.com

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: N-D-E. Perfect.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.402 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Or LifeAfterLife.com.

00:29:22.402 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: See, you're
into new technology.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.026 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, I don't
know how to use it yet,

00:29:26.026 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:10%
but I've memorized
those formulas.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And my wife translates.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.242 align:middle line:84%
She gives me the messages,
and then I write them down,

00:29:32.242 --> 00:29:33.200 align:middle line:90%
and she sends them out.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:33.991 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Always continue the well
wishes to you, Mr. Moody.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Likewise, George.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.582 align:middle line:84%
It's always just so
great to be with you.

00:29:39.582 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.684 align:middle line:90%
We could talk for hours.

00:29:41.684 --> 00:29:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: We could, we could.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About just life.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.509 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Thank you, George.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So many things are
happening in this universe that

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:10%
are somewhat baffling to people.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:10%
But one thing you can
take to the bank: there

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:10%
is life after death.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
thanks for participating

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.380 align:middle line:10%
in "Beyond Belief."
