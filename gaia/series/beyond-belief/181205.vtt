00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:10%
There is a topic that
I just immerse myself

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:10%
in whenever it comes up.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's called remote viewing.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And we have a
special guest for you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
today on "Beyond
Belief," Lyn Buchanan.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Lyn was what we would
call a psychic spy.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
He spent 8 and 1/2 years
with the military's unit

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:84%
investigating the phenomena
and using remote viewing

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:90%
in his everyday military career.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Lyn, welcome to the program.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LYN BUCHANAN: Well,
thank you for inviting me.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is an amazing
subject, remote viewing.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:10%
>>BUCHANAN: You know, I
am not surprised by much

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:10%
that I see in remote
viewing anymore.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:10%
But I will never
quit being amazed.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
When they read me
on in the unit,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'm on
"Candid Camera."

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:90%
The military doesn't do this.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And I was
amazed that they did.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.787 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still amazed
by the whole thing.

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.060 align:middle line:84%
What branch of
service were you in?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Army.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:90%
So you're in the Army?

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not a
remote viewer at the time?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.276 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: No, uh-uh.

00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they find you?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: There was an
incident that is still

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.355 align:middle line:84%
classified that
happened over in--

00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, tell us.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Well, it's sort
of pictured in "The Men Who

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:90%
Stare at Goats," that movie.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.354 align:middle line:84%
But I have always had a sort of
a PK ability when I get angry.

00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I was one of those
poltergeist kids, you know?

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Wishing people
into the cornfield?

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.273 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Sort of, yeah.

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And I got phenomenally
angry one day.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And about $50 million worth
of computers burned out.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The field
station went down

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
for a still classified
amount of time.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And General Stubblebine, head
of the Army Security Command,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:90%
got wind of it and came.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted me to
be a part of a unit

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to start, where
we would kill enemy computers,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
with the end goal of
learning how to control

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
the computers instead
of killing them,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
so that we could make their
missiles drop into the sea

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
or turn around and go
back at him or whatever.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And Congress said, no, that
smites of mind control.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And we've been caught
doing that before.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:90%
And they wouldn't fund it.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: So he took me
out to this little unit

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:84%
out at Fort Meade, Maryland that
was doing the remote viewing.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
They read me on, which
is where they tell you

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:84%
what they actually do rather
than what they tell the public.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't believe it.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.402 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't even
know what remote viewing was

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
at the time, did you?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I had no idea.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.284 align:middle line:84%
He just plopped me into
the unit and said here,

00:03:24.284 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:90%
he's your problem now.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here you go.

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.801 align:middle line:84%
I wound up being the trainer
of the unit, in fact.

00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
people in that unit

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.749 align:middle line:90%
are people that we all know.

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.290 align:middle line:84%
They've been on the
"Coast to Coast."

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.525 align:middle line:10%
The Ed Dames, the David
Moreheads, Ingo Swann,

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:10%
and those people like that.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.581 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, David Morehouse.

00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wonderful people
who were into this way

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:90%
before you were.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But you picked it
up pretty fast.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It was
like duck to water.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen anything so
amazing and so just engrossing

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:90%
It struck me as phenomenal.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
What really struck
me as phenomenal

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:84%
was that, first of all,
they didn't want psychics.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
They wanted people who
were database-oriented so

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that from day one,
they could say,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.510 align:middle line:90%
you know, we gave you a target.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
You described the colors
with 50% accuracy.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
You described the shape
with 43% accuracy and so on.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:90%
So here's your weaknesses.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
train you in these.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.102 align:middle line:84%
Here's your strengths,
where you got 80% accuracy,

00:04:40.102 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:90%
we're going to depend on you.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is uncanny.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And the database, I
mean, it was facts.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
You prove yourself or
you're out, you know.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they kick
some people out, Lyn.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: There were
people who left, yeah.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:90%
But we still do that.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, now that we're
in the civilian arena,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
we keep track of your
strengths and weaknesses.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And like if you're
good at colors,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're terrible at shapes,
then anytime we need a color,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:90%
we'll come to you.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.434 align:middle line:90%
If we need shapes--

00:05:19.434 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, you
worked as a team.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:90%
We work as a team.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And that way, we can get your
90% correctness of colors,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
my 90% correctness of shapes,
and somebody else's, you know,

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Location maybe
or something like that.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And it also helps because
we know your weaknesses,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:84%
we know how to
customize your training

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:84%
so that we can build your
weaknesses into new strengths.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's one
of those things

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:90%
where there's no woo-woo to it.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:90%
You do your work.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:90%
You prove yourself.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't do the
work, we'll train you.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Or we'll get your job
at Walmart or something.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it a classified
program at the time?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yes, it was.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.843 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
couldn't talk about it

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:90%
to your friends or anybody?

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Not even
my wife, no, uh-uh.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did she know that
you had these abilities.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Actually,
she did, because when

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
General Stubblebine sent a team
out to Germany where I was,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
they took my wife
and me out to dinner.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, we can't tell you
what we're recruiting you for.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And so your wife
can't hear this.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And she was sitting on the
wall side of the table.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And she said, OK, I
won't pay attention.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:90%
And so he told it.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And he turned to me,
and he said, do you

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:84%
think your wife would
be OK with this.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I think she might.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:84%
She said, yeah, I'd
be fine with it.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And so she actually
knew what it was about.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.667 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: She didn't get any
training or anything like that.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She didn't
know the depth of it.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: No.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of our friends who
was in that unit, Dr. Doom, Ed

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Ames.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:10%
>>ED AMES: At the time of
the unit's formative days,

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.640 align:middle line:10%
I was at very high levels
of US Intel, office

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:10%
of Secretary of Defense.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So my job as a targeting
officer, a science

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and technology
targeting officer,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
was to choose our
targets, particularly

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:90%
biological warfare--

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.206 align:middle line:84%
very classified top secret
Russian and Chinese targets.

00:07:42.206 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, we couldn't
penetrate them.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I had all these tools
at my disposal, agents

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, very
exotic technologies.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't get
into these programs.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So I was read on, briefed,
about the existence

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
of this experimental unit,
a remote viewing unit.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And I started to use
their information

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
to cross cue my other
systems to tip off satellites

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and other agents to
look in certain places.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to finally
gain a foothold into these very,

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:90%
very secret Soviet programs--

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:84%
nuclear weapons programs,
biological warfare programs,

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And I became so
enthralled with this unit,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I stepped down from these
celestial levels of Intel

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to take over as operations
and training officer.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.552 align:middle line:90%
And that was 33 or so years ago.

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still doing it.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.009 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ed Ames, of course,
was appearing on our Gaia show,

00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:90%
"Buzzsaw" with Sean Stone.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:84%
And he was an influential part
of all of this, wasn't he?

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.789 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Well, actually,
he was not a viewer.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:84%
But he was the training officer,
which meant that he was, again,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:90%
the targeting officer.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So he would plan the sessions,
who would pick the viewers,

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and would take the targets that
were coming in from customers

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and decide who should
view and all that.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:90%
I was the trainer.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:90%
He was the training officer.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:90%
So he guided the training.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:90%
I did the training.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
some of the projects,

00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Lyn, that they
had you undertake?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The ones that
have been declassified,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:90%
we did things for the Cold War.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
We did things for Kuwait,
Afghanistan, Granada--

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
invasion of Granada.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, right.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: We also did a
lot of basically intelligence

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
gathering on the developments--
the scientific and political

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:84%
developments of
foreign countries,

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:84%
the plans and intentions
of foreign leaders

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and military leaders
and things like that.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they
want you to investigate

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.317 align:middle line:84%
the physical aspects
of what was going on?

00:10:04.317 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh yeah.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the strengths
that we wound up gathering,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:84%
you could give us an
encrypted coordinate--

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
this is project 97-0404
and describe it.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
the session, we

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
would have laid out the
floor plan of the building

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:90%
where a hostage was being held.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And with really
great accuracy, in fact.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the average accuracy--
we did a two-month long study

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:84%
on this with
feedbackable targets--

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.256 align:middle line:90%
the average accuracy was 82.7%.

00:10:53.256 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge, huge.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It is actually.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:84%
The police say if you can cut
down their search area by 10%,

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.590 align:middle line:90%
they're happy.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: We had around
82.7% accuracy overall,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
which meant 60% in some
things, like shapes

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:90%
or, 90% in other things.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly
is remote viewing, Lyn?

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: OK.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing,
everybody has some theory

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
about where you get the
information and all that.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has any proof.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:90%
So we really don't know.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that you
have your conscious mind

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:90%
and the subconscious mind.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.390 align:middle line:84%
We say subconscious, you
know, instead of unconscious,

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
because the subconscious
is not unconscious at all.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's quite functional.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It's
very functional.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, it has a connection
to a collective consciousness--

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
not collective
unconscious-- the collective

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:90%
is very conscious too.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, that seems
to also have a connection

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:84%
to a universal
consciousness of some kind.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
We have no understanding
of what it is.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:84%
But just like the ancients
used to use batteries

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:90%
to electroplate things.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Iraqi battery.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea
what electricity was.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.310 align:middle line:90%
But they knew how to use it.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have learned
how to use that.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
The trick is that your
conscious and subconscious mind

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:90%
don't talk to each other.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.955 align:middle line:84%
A man named Ingo
Swann developed it.

00:12:40.955 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God rest his soul.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh
yeah, fantastic man.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:84%
He developed a way
where you can actually

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
use your body as
a martial art that

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:84%
will let your subconscious,
which can control your body,

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
talk to your conscious mind,
and it's a complex method

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
for doing that.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And once you get your conscious
and subconscious talking

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:84%
to each other, all of a
sudden, it opens the door.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very powerful.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh,
man, it's amazing.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I first heard
of remote viewing years ago--

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
years ago, Lyn--
it boggled my mind.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost as
if you send your eyes out

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
into wherever and it
physically sees things.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:90%
how does that work?

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:90%
How can you see without looking?

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:10%
>>BUCHANAN: The only
real honest answer

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:10%
for that is it
works pretty well.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:90%
How and why we don't know.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: How and why--

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:84%
like I say, everybody
has a theory,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and they hang on to that
theory like they're lost at sea

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's the only
thing that floats.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
that you were accurate?

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:07.609 align:middle line:90%
How did they test that?

00:14:07.609 --> 00:14:09.066 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: One of
the reasons they

00:14:09.066 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:84%
didn't want psychics is
because psychics tend

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.321 align:middle line:90%
to believe everything they get.

00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right or wrong.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Right or wrong.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right or wrong.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And from
day one, we databased

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:90%
everything we found out.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And from day one, you had to
accept, oh, 15% of the time,

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.460 align:middle line:90%
I get the color wrong.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: And so on.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:38.801 align:middle line:84%
And you know, with the military,
it was do the job, or--

00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out you go.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: --out you go.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:90%
And you have to prove yourself.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
We still do that when we use
the controlled remote viewing

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:90%
in the civilian arena.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
inaccuracies pop up?

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Missing something, for
example, why would that happen?

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: 'Cause you're
one of those stupid humans.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I guess
that's the reason.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:90%
It's just human failure.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Am I correct, Lyn,
that with remote viewing,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.790 align:middle line:84%
the more you think
about something,

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.630 align:middle line:90%
the least you'll be able to do?

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The more you try
to interpret what you get.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.092 align:middle line:84%
We tell everybody, whatever
comes through, you know--

00:15:19.092 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just let it come in.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.425 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Let it come in.

00:15:21.425 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:84%
If it says red, don't
tell me it's an apple.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Tell me it's red.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And don't try to
interpret anything.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Let your subconscious
mind be your eyes.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: In fact, in the
training that I'm doing now

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:51.034 align:middle line:84%
on the internet, we start out
by having you look at a target.

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at the target.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Look at the target
picture and describe it.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And
then, we teach you--

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By physically
looking at it.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.286 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: By
physically looking at it.

00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:01.203 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
how to describe things.

00:16:01.203 --> 00:16:02.244 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, that's true.

00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And we teach
you how to describe things.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we say, OK, now we're
going to let your subconscious

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:90%
mind be your eyes for you.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
We hide the target,
let you do the session,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and then immediately give you
the feedback and say, OK, what

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:90%
you right about?

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:90%
What were you wrong about?

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Score this, accept your
accuracy, accept your failures,

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:90%
accept your successes.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is remote
viewing a hunch?

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.465 align:middle line:84%
Or is it that visualization
in your brain?

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: In the beginning,
when you're first learning,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
you're going by
hunches, and you know,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:90%
you get some kind of an idea.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And you tend to think, oh,
that can't be right, you know.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And you just learn through
practice, practice, practice

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%
to accept things.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.079 align:middle line:84%
Now, the controlled remote
viewing methodology,

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:84%
you go ahead and write
everything that comes out.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:84%
By the end of your
session, you've

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
gotten some really good
mental contact with the site.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can go
through your session.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can say, oh, that's
garbage, that's garbage.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.675 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is good stuff.

00:17:19.675 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is good.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And
you filter it out.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, sort of
like using a sieve, you know,

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
you go through
everything you got.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:90%
You filter out the good stuff.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:90%
You throw away the garbage.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.965 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of the process.

00:17:34.965 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, you
get better results.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.637 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Controlled
remote viewing.

00:17:42.637 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Controlled
remote viewing.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Generally there are four
types of remote viewing.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:10%
The first is controlled
remote viewing, or CRV.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
commonly used form

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
of remote viewing that was
almost exclusively used

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:90%
by the US military and the CIA.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:84%
In CRV, there are
typically six stages.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:84%
First the viewer
records a gestalt.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:84%
This is something that makes
up the majority of the target.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, if the
target is in the desert,

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
the viewer may get
the impression of sand

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:90%
or the color of sand.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:84%
They may get the impression
of heat or dryness.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:10%
Many remote viewers
use an ideogram,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:10%
which is nothing more than a
squiggly shape or line that

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.474 align:middle line:10%
helps the viewer to stay focused
or dialed in to the target.

00:18:30.474 --> 00:18:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Next, the viewer
begins to collect

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:84%
data coming in the form of
tastes, smells, textures,

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:90%
colors, sounds, shapes.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, the data
could still mean anything.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:84%
However, the more the
viewer works on the target,

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
the more information
comes in about the target.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
The viewer then records any
dimensional characteristics

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:90%
about the target--

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.800 align:middle line:84%
the height, the
length, the weight,

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.004 align:middle line:90%
whether it is large or small.

00:18:56.004 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that
the viewer never

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:84%
tried to identify anything
within their view.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:84%
The viewer then records
the qualitative data,

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.800 align:middle line:84%
describing something to be
soft or hard, strong or weak,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:90%
good or bad, bright or dark.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, as the viewer
collects more data,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
he or she must question
their precepts.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:10%
Or in other words,
they must make sure

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:10%
that they stick to the
set rules of the session.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:10%
They must make sure
that the data is not

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:10%
contaminated with
bits and pieces

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:10%
of their own imagination.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:10%
The viewer then tries to figure
out why certain pieces of data

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:10%
was recorded, the meaning
of a word or number that

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:10%
was written.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:84%
In the final stage of this
type of remote viewing,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:84%
the viewer can now begin to
put together the details--

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
an assessment, where they
can draw out floor plans

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
or create 3D models using
clay or some other medium.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:84%
This is where the viewer is
giving great specific details

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:90%
of the target--

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
the position, the
location, the dimensions,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:84%
descriptions of any people or
animals at the target site.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.747 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the picture
really comes together.

00:20:01.747 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clean
fingernails there, Lyn.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:84%
That's a very good
descriptor, by the way,

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:84%
of the controlled
remote viewing process.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:84%
The process is you first
get the overall aspects,

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:90%
the gestalts of the site--

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:84%
like, I have no idea
what the target is,

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.360 align:middle line:84%
but I know there's some
water and some land.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they say, OK, don't
worry about the target.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the water.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.726 align:middle line:90%
And you say, OK--

00:20:29.726 --> 00:20:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and here's where the
physical part comes in--

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: --it tastes salty.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:90%
It's cold.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
It's moving up and
down and so on.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like
an ocean, you know.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Ah.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.065 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:20:45.065 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:90%
No, don't assume.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: You
just interpreted.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I did.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:48.711 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: That's right.

00:20:48.711 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.400 align:middle line:84%
You keep, you know, how does
it smell, how does it taste,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And in these descriptors, you
wind up defining the target.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that, they say,
OK, tell me about the land.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And so you never have to do the
whole target, the whole site.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.050 align:middle line:84%
You go through and you find
descriptors and everything.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Once you've gone
through these and you've

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:84%
paid attention, close
attention, to everything,

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.145 align:middle line:84%
you really get a good
contact with the target,

00:21:27.145 --> 00:21:30.370 align:middle line:90%
a mental contact.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And like it showed there,
at the end, OK, the land.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it has something on it.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, describe the something.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:90%
You describe the something.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:84%
At the end, here's
a piece of clay,

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.286 align:middle line:84%
build me a model
of the something.

00:21:49.286 --> 00:21:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As they
were doing here.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.451 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: As they
were doing there, yeah.

00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:90%
And you build a model.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we have what's
called a sand table, which you

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:90%
use in psychology for things.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have strips of cloth and
little blocks and everything

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And in the end of a session,
we can ask a viewer, OK, here's

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.880 align:middle line:90%
this sand table.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, you
said there's water.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Here's some blue cloth.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Find the water.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Put it on the sand table.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And what we wind up with
is a very accurate map

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:90%
of the target site.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that's called
controlled remote viewing?

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It's called
controlled remote viewing, not

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:84%
because the remote viewer
is controlled by the method,

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
but because the method allows
the viewer to have control

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:90%
over the process.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's the remote
viewing then--

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's important.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh,
that's very important.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewing is
controlled by the viewer.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was in Las Vegas
a couple months ago, Lyn,

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and I like to do mental
experiments while I'm there.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And explain this for me.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm playing a little blackjack.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
that blackjack dealer

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:84%
is going to flip a blackjack,
an ace and a face card.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.420 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.780 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.055 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough--

00:23:23.055 --> 00:23:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It happened.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --they do that.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, how in the heck
is that working?

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:84%
What am I doing when
I get that sense?

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Am I remote viewing?

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: You just
said the answer.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:90%
When you get that sense--

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.761 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: --you get a feeling.

00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
overwhelming feeling too.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It's an
overwhelming feeling.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:10%
And my first book out was
called "The Seventh Sense."

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good read.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, thank you.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And it talks about the fact
that the sixth sense is actually

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:84%
the ambiance, you're
feeling of the room.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Psychic is the seventh sense.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And that ambiance feel
that you suddenly get of,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's going
to be a blackjack.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.709 align:middle line:90%
And it was really overwhelming.

00:24:10.709 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: That's right.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.917 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if it
was not a blackjack,

00:24:13.917 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
surprised, you know.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: That's right.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's the physical feel.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:84%
The psychic sense
teaches you how

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:84%
to take the psychic sense, which
doesn't have that feel, move it

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:84%
over into the body and use the
body's ability to feel things

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:90%
at a far distant place.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:42.257 align:middle line:84%
If you were here, and in Las
Vegas, he pulls a blackjack,

00:24:42.257 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't feel it here.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wouldn't feel it.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't even know it.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.333 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: You
wouldn't even know it.

00:24:46.333 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the ambiance
sense is your ability

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to feel what's in
the room around you.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is critical in
some intuitive sense, isn't it?

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Hey.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A good CEO who
has that ability could

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:90%
do some remarkable things.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.397 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: That's right
and poker players get money.

00:25:05.397 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.579 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:25:07.579 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: They read the room.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:09.786 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the face.

00:25:09.786 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: And the face.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's your
sense of ambiance.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.530 align:middle line:90%
That's your sixth sense.

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Your seventh sense
is the psychic.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And what we teach
you to do is use

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that sixth ambiance sense to
feel the same ambience that

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:84%
is in some other place
halfway around the world,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.527 align:middle line:90%
halfway across the universe.

00:25:33.527 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of your
colleagues, Paul Smith,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:84%
appeared with me on "Beyond
Belief" to talk about--

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Paul is a nice guy.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:90%
He really is.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.547 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --remote viewing.

00:25:39.547 --> 00:25:41.630 align:middle line:10%
If you're at home watching
this program right now,

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.213 align:middle line:10%
Paul, and somebody
is probably saying,

00:25:43.213 --> 00:25:46.100 align:middle line:10%
hey, so maybe I should
dabble in remote viewing.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.426 align:middle line:84%
What's the benefit to
somebody to do this?

00:25:49.426 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL SMITH: Well,
we talked about one

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.854 align:middle line:84%
that it enhances intuition
in just normal everyday life.

00:25:54.854 --> 00:25:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're not
remote viewing,

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:84%
your intuition has been
improved in normal cases.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It of course is a
self-validating thing which

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.340 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people appreciate.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here's something
that tells me, yes, I

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.030 align:middle line:90%
am more than my physical body.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just this meat machine
that science says I am.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
But you can use it a
number of other ways.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.402 align:middle line:84%
Investment is probably one of
the biggest popular things now.

00:26:16.402 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would that work?

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.651 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, what they
do is use a thing called

00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:21.040 align:middle line:90%
associative remote viewing.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of applying remote
viewing to actually predict

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:84%
the outcome of a
future event that

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.653 align:middle line:84%
has a number of different
possible outcomes.

00:26:27.653 --> 00:26:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So the prime example is
sports betting, right?

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:90%
And it often is used in that.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's an amazing guy.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.681 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: He really is, yeah.

00:26:34.681 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:10%
He's good too.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.740 align:middle line:10%
We had many different types
of remote viewing in the unit.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:84%
We were testing out
everything we could.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:90%
We used the ones that worked.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:84%
We threw away the
ones that didn't.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Associative remote viewing
was one of them that did work.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Controlled remote
viewing is very

00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:84%
good at getting
information that's real.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.271 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Things
like numbers--

00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like lottery numbers.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Lottery
numbers, those are concepts.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:84%
We found that associative remote
viewing is really good at that.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Associative remote viewing
is good at the things

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that controlled remote
viewing are not good at.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Controlled remote viewing
is good at the things

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:middle line:84%
that associative remote
viewing is not good at.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that and basically
one other method that we had,

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
we use those in order
to get the information

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:90%
that it was good at.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.950 align:middle line:84%
You not only use the viewers
who are good at something,

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:84%
but you use the method
that's good at something.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I've dabbled a lot in
remote viewing, Lyn.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I've used techniques that
people like you and Paul Smith

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:84%
have told people
about over the years.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good at numbers.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I can't pick lottery numbers.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Nobody is.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I can pick
these concepts and stuff.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.160 align:middle line:84%
But I have learned,
as you've been saying,

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:90%
to just let it flow.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.710 align:middle line:84%
If I tried to think
it, it doesn't happen.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: The conscious
mind sucks at being psychic.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really does.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It really does.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
You've got to let your
subconscious do it.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't turn it over
to the subconscious mind--

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:84%
we always say the viewer's
in charge of the session.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, the viewer is not here.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:84%
It's your subconscious
mind that is the viewer.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to let the
viewer, your subconscious,

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.405 align:middle line:84%
be in charge of
the entire session.

00:28:33.405 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many times I've had
a guest on "Coast to Coast,"

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:84%
the radio show, and we've been
talking about remote viewing.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've done a little
experiment with them.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said let me
remote view you.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:90%
You're sitting in a couch area.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.190 align:middle line:84%
But your feet are
propped up on a table.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're wearing
a white T-shirt.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:57.267 align:middle line:84%
And 9 out of 10 times, they
say, you're absolutely right.

00:28:57.267 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh yeah.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.722 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I'm doing
something right.

00:28:59.722 --> 00:29:00.680 align:middle line:90%
What am I tapping into?

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I know one of the
shows that we did one time,

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
you had someone
hand you an envelope

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.590 align:middle line:90%
that had a word written in it.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And you said,
OK, tell me the word.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I have no
idea because I'm not psychic.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But you let me sit down and
do a remote viewing session.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And I will not only
print out the word.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I will print it out
in his handwriting.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: And that's true.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But with the controlled
remote viewing,

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.440 align:middle line:90%
you have to do the session.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But the psychic part,
some people can do that.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a psychic.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I can give
you 90% accuracy

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.400 align:middle line:84%
on what's written on a
piece of paper that's

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.150 align:middle line:84%
locked in a safe
in some government

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:90%
office in some foreign country.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.302 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I'm the first to
tell you, I'm not a psychic.

00:30:11.302 --> 00:30:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An interesting take.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:84%
How could people
use remote viewing

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:90%
in their day-to-day life, Lyn?

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: If you're in touch
with your subconscious mind,

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.710 align:middle line:84%
it not only knows what's
going on around the world,

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
but it also knows why you do
those things you don't want

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.530 align:middle line:84%
to do, but you
wind up doing them,

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.480 align:middle line:84%
why you don't do the
things you want to do,

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:90%
but they never get done.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It knows where
your car keys are.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody is
always taking our car keys.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:90%
That's a different show--

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:84%
the little demons
that hide our stuff.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah, it
knows what happens

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:90%
to the other sock in the dryer.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.550 align:middle line:90%
It's in the dryer still.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can use it for,
you know, personal reasons.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:31:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But to spend all of the time and
effort, practice and practice

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and practice that it takes to do
the controlled remote viewing,

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.760 align:middle line:90%
it may not be worth it for that.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is precognition
the same as remote viewing?

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:90%
And let me give you an example.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I was approaching an
intersection one day.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:90%
And I've got the green light--

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:90%
you go.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Something was telling me,
don't go through this.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Right.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't go through this.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:90%
It was a very weird feeling.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Don't go through this.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So with cars
behind me, Lyn, I stopped.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.826 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I didn't go
through the intersection.

00:31:35.826 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:84%
At that very point,
where I should've

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
gone through my
green light, a car

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.780 align:middle line:84%
goes through its
red light right.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:90%
It would have broadsided me.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:84%
God knows what would
have happened to me.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Is that precognition?

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Or is that remote viewing?

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it may be
one and the same.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Well it's
one and the same.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing, these days, is
the new age word for psychic

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.100 align:middle line:90%
or clairvoyance or so on.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The controlled remote
viewing is the method

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:90%
used by the military.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.760 align:middle line:90%
It's totally different.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But remote viewing
is the word that's

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.950 align:middle line:90%
used for natural ability.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very good word.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:21.040 align:middle line:90%
And everybody has that ability.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And generally, when
your life is in danger

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:90%
or something like that--

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.666 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something kicks in.

00:32:27.666 --> 00:32:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN:
--something kicks in,

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.080 align:middle line:90%
proving that everybody has it.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I was driving along one day,
just a country road, and all

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.179 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, I
knew that a dog was

00:32:38.179 --> 00:32:40.720 align:middle line:84%
going to run out in front of
me, and I slammed on the brakes.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And this dog ran
across the road.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Just amazing how that works.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.191 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It's amazing, yeah.

00:32:45.191 --> 00:32:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have visualized
driving along a two-lane road.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I had this horrible feeling
that someone was going

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.137 align:middle line:90%
to pass over the middle line--

00:32:54.137 --> 00:32:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh yeah.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --right
where I was coming.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I would pull
farther over to the right

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:90%
as cars were coming.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.320 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough,
there was another car

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.290 align:middle line:10%
that didn't go quite
into the other lane.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But it would have clipped me
had I been hugging the line.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.117 align:middle line:84%
And this happens time
and time again with me.

00:33:15.117 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It does.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do it, the more
practice you get at doing it,

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and the better you get.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.590 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
things that surprised me

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:84%
about the controlled remote
viewing that I learned.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.390 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.376 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
becoming psychic.

00:33:30.376 --> 00:33:31.176 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with that.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Nothing
wrong with it, no.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:43.492 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I first started,
Skip Atwater, who was--

00:33:43.492 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another giant.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:84%
He took me over to
the building where

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:51.710 align:middle line:84%
we did the remote viewing and
the practice and all that.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And he sat me down, and he said,
look at the room around you.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.920 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at the room.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, something
I want you to know.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:84%
In this room-- maybe not
in the rest of the world--

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:09.040 align:middle line:84%
but in this room, it's
really OK to be psychic.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden it was OK.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love it when I go
through these precognitive

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:17.954 align:middle line:90%
remote viewing sessions.

00:34:17.954 --> 00:34:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh yes.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.384 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's kind of
exhilarating, isn't it?

00:34:20.384 --> 00:34:21.389 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It is, yeah.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
when you're right,

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:90%
it makes it even more exciting.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: [LAUGHS]

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The secret
I have learned

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.420 align:middle line:84%
is to react to these
feelings when you get them.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
biggest stumbling block

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.630 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Well, you know, a
lot of people get good advice

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:40.739 align:middle line:90%
and don't--

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:41.219 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't take it.

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:42.449 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Don't take it.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And when your subconscious gives
you some good advice, take it.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
think this works?

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:58.194 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I think it's
just a part of human ability.

00:34:58.194 --> 00:34:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's out
there somewhere.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.151 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: It's
out there somewhere.

00:35:01.151 --> 00:35:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's one of our senses.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake
talks about the--

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I forget what he
calls it, but he's

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.500 align:middle line:90%
done all kinds of experiments.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And they've proven correct
that what's generally called

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.950 align:middle line:90%
the hundredth monkey theory--

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.000 align:middle line:90%
it actually works.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lynne McTaggart
calls it the field.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: That's right.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's there.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: And it's there.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.050 align:middle line:90%
We can't explain it.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, everybody
has a theory.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has any proof.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are some people
like you better than others?

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I think
because they pay attention.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I know one time when
somebody said, well,

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.840 align:middle line:84%
why do you think all these
strange things in your life

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.030 align:middle line:90%
have happened to you?

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I think they
happen to everybody.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.110 align:middle line:90%
I just pay attention.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're training
people now via the internet.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I'm
building an internet.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting old.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, you'll
go on forever.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.207 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I used to say I'm
younger than I used to be,

00:36:05.207 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not saying that anymore.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:13.050 align:middle line:84%
But we have been teaching
three-day classes.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And now, when I
went into the unit,

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.720 align:middle line:84%
it was supposed to
be about two years

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.160 align:middle line:90%
of training eight hours a day--

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's--

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: --five days--

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --intense.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: --a week.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Intense.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is an extremely
complex subject.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And in three days of training
for the basic course,

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:37.300 align:middle line:84%
we can teach you the
basics and it works.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But you're learning 10 to
15% of what we know already.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm doing
with this course

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
is I'm making videos, each
video on a single aspect

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.280 align:middle line:90%
of controlled remote viewing.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.396 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Excellent.

00:36:55.396 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: For
the basic course,

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:02.290 align:middle line:90%
I have at present 120 videos.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I have 10 courses
that are going to take

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:84%
the different levels of remote
viewing and applications.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to wind up
with 1,000 to 1,500 videos

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:17.857 align:middle line:90%
for these courses.

00:37:17.857 --> 00:37:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And I
want it to be perfect.

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I want it to be
totally in depth.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I want
to leave as my legacy

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.760 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Excellent.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And so I want
it to be right and in depth.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I want it to be everything
that I know that then people

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.960 align:middle line:90%
can build on after that.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I'm doing right now.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:51.935 align:middle line:84%
I have quit teaching the
in-house classes, because

00:37:51.935 --> 00:37:54.340 align:middle line:84%
of my health and
my wife's health.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.790 align:middle line:84%
But for the past
five years now, I've

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:84%
been developing this entire,
absolutely, totally in-depth

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.980 align:middle line:84%
course where it
teaches you everything.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend, Ed Dames,
continues to train people.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Learning the RV protocols
takes hours of instruction,

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.600 align:middle line:10%
so we can't present the
entire process here.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:84%
But this student has been
here since early this morning

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and is starting to get a
handle on the RV process.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.430 align:middle line:84%
The student is asked
to leave the room

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:27.265 align:middle line:84%
while Ed Dames selects a
random target from a newspaper.

00:38:27.265 --> 00:38:30.544 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:30.544 --> 00:38:40.820 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:84%
See those numbers
written on the article--

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:90%
84116872?

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Those are called target
reference numbers or TRNs.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:51.980 align:middle line:84%
This was a blind training
system developed in the military

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.420 align:middle line:84%
to keep the targets
hidden from the viewer.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Because a human mind
has a tendency to use

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:00.920 align:middle line:84%
imagination which would
ruin an RV session.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.250 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to utilize the
unconscious mind to retrieve

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:90%
all of the data remotely.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
This system works
because a remote viewer

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.360 align:middle line:84%
receives only the
TRN numbers and must

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.090 align:middle line:84%
rely on following the
remote viewing protocol,

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.070 align:middle line:84%
so that their
unconscious mind actually

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:84%
collects the target data
the numbers are pointing to.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as a universal
mind data filing system.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:28.100 align:middle line:84%
For the session, the student
receives only the TRN numbers.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely nothing
else is provided.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.080 align:middle line:84%
He has no idea whether
the target is even

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.465 align:middle line:84%
a person, place, thing, or
event in the past, present,

00:39:36.465 --> 00:39:37.790 align:middle line:90%
or future.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:40.220 align:middle line:84%
The possibilities are
literally endless,

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.440 align:middle line:84%
so the student
must shed any idea

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.560 align:middle line:84%
of trying to guess what the
target is and must strictly

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.560 align:middle line:84%
follow the non-thinking
RV protocol.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:84%
During the entire
30-minute process,

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.110 align:middle line:84%
there has been absolutely
no assistance or information

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.210 align:middle line:90%
provided to the student.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:84%
As the session unfolds with
colors, descriptors, motion,

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:84%
a pattern is beginning to
emerge of an object described

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:09.380 align:middle line:84%
as irony, metallic, bitter,
acidic, chemical, and enclosed.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.200 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewer writes
that the site is surreal,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.330 align:middle line:90%
and he feels concerned.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:19.070 align:middle line:84%
The student is finally on the
last stage of the RV process

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and is creating what is
called a site template.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.250 align:middle line:90%


00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.710 align:middle line:84%
The student is drawing
a large, round structure

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.300 align:middle line:90%
filled with hot water.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Targets there have emotion
of oblivious to surroundings.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell me if
anybody there is oblivious

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.550 align:middle line:10%
to their surroundings or
whether or not they should be?

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:45.110 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:10%
Happy and oblivious to
surroundings, I'd say.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.410 align:middle line:84%
That's a nuclear reactor
in the background.

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>> In the finished sketch,
we clearly see the student

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:57.260 align:middle line:84%
identify the target as a
large, round structure with hot

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.160 align:middle line:90%
liquid.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.430 align:middle line:84%
The living targets nearby
are labeled as oblivious

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.316 align:middle line:90%
to their surroundings.

00:41:03.316 --> 00:41:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm surprised.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.410 align:middle line:90%
I think I really got it.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:10.329 align:middle line:10%
But after seeing this, I
know that it does work.

00:41:10.329 --> 00:41:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty uncanny.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It is.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And you notice a part of
that was immediate feedback.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Right there when the
session is fresh,

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:90%
you get the immediate feedback.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.650 align:middle line:84%
You go back through
your session.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.680 align:middle line:84%
You find out what you did
right, what you did wrong.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And you accept not only what
you did wrong, but you accept.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:84%
You learn to accept
what you did right.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:90%
And this is the training.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And-- yeah.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And what you saw there
was part of the process.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:84%
His is TRB, which is an offshoot
of CRV, similar to it, but not

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:90%
the same as the military.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can't people get
better and better, Lyn,

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.110 align:middle line:90%
as they do this?

00:41:59.110 --> 00:41:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, yeah.

>>BUCHANAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because I have
accepted my weaknesses.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people
select targets for me

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that will practice my weaknesses
and get better, and better,

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.670 align:middle line:90%
and better.

ability to do it.

thing they did stop

I always say that I
hope that they are still

doing it, because
they'd be stupid not to.

>>NOORY: I would agree.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.688 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: That brings
up the question--

00:43:41.688 --> 00:43:43.760 align:middle line:84%
does our government
do anything stupid?

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many times.

Why aren't they utilizing

00:43:48.422 --> 00:43:50.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a question I've
asked Paul Smith and Ed Dames

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:51.780 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is, is the
program continuing?

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.150 align:middle line:90%
They think it is not.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Because they think the
government would have used

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.810 align:middle line:90%
you folks again and again.

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:06.275 align:middle line:84%
But I think they have
a new crop of people.

00:44:06.275 --> 00:44:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: That's very likely.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they
learned a lot from us.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:84%
We developed a
humongous database

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.510 align:middle line:84%
over the almost quarter of
a century that we worked

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.430 align:middle line:90%
and it was analyzed.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:29.150 align:middle line:84%
We had scientific oversight
committees and all that.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, I hope
they're still using it.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
defend against it?

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Can you create, for
example, a shield

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:40.340 align:middle line:84%
to block a remote
viewer from penetrating?

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: A remote viewer?

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:42.500 align:middle line:90%
A psychic?

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, piece of cake.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.360 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can block them?

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: A controlled
remote viewer?

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:49.050 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:49.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:53.750 align:middle line:90%


00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.261 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:44:55.261 --> 00:44:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What an amazing tool.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:00.815 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Because we developed
methods to get past blocks.

00:45:00.815 --> 00:45:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.050 align:middle line:84%
In the almost
quarter century, we

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.080 align:middle line:84%
did all kinds of
stuff that was not

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:15.650 align:middle line:84%
developed at Stanford Research
to use an actual intelligence

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:90%
gathering.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.380 align:middle line:90%
And we kept data.

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.120 align:middle line:84%
We found out what works
and what didn't work.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And part of it was, how do
you get past being blocked?

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And we found out how to do it.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever seen or witnessed

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:34.262 align:middle line:90%
an amazing child remote viewer?

00:45:34.262 --> 00:45:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I've seen videos.

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
better than most adults?

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I think they
haven't learned to be bad yet.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.050 align:middle line:90%


00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
receive things, probably.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I think we
learn in our growing

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.840 align:middle line:90%
up to block our psychic ability.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.954 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anymore books
coming out for you?

00:45:58.954 --> 00:45:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I hope so.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I had a computer attack that
wiped out not only my computer,

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:08.810 align:middle line:90%
but 12 years worth of backup.

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:11.214 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody
do that to you?

00:46:11.214 --> 00:46:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: It was surgical.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.639 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And I lost three
books that I had about halfway

00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:16.438 align:middle line:90%
finished.

00:46:16.438 --> 00:46:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
was in there?

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Everything.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone?

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Gone.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:20.430 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No backup?

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: --I'm rebuilding.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:26.870 align:middle line:84%
With the videos I've been
doing for these courses--

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I've been making multiple
backups not connected

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:31.880 align:middle line:90%
to my computer.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.860 align:middle line:90%
And so I still have those.

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.560 align:middle line:84%
But 12 years worth
of everything.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.070 align:middle line:90%
My family pictures--

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: --gone.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.604 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lyn, when
you think back

00:46:41.604 --> 00:46:45.260 align:middle line:84%
to the days of your childhood,
and your teenage years,

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.396 align:middle line:84%
and your young adult
years, did you ever

00:46:48.396 --> 00:46:50.270 align:middle line:84%
think you'd be doing
what you're doing today?

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: No, of course not.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:53.040 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what did you want
to be when you were younger?

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:56.538 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: I wanted
to be an astronomer.

00:46:56.538 --> 00:46:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aha, you
love telescopes, huh?

00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: I love telescopes.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.070 align:middle line:90%
I love astronomy.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And that love of
astronomy has helped.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.070 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you this thing.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:16.610 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I've
been doing since the military--

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.250 align:middle line:84%
not in the military,
but since the military

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:24.870 align:middle line:84%
is developing diplomatic area
books for other star systems,

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:25.670 align:middle line:90%
simply because--

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's interesting.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: --if
we have astronauts

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:35.990 align:middle line:84%
that go to another star system
and meet a new intelligence

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:40.890 align:middle line:84%
there, first contact is what
starts the biggest wars.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.879 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: You make
some stupid mistake.

00:47:43.879 --> 00:47:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they don't get it.

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And you know
what an area book is, right?

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Diplomatic
area book telling you

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.670 align:middle line:84%
the customs and everything
in another country.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Civilization.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.405 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And so
we've been doing those.

00:47:56.405 --> 00:48:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
the reason I've been

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.250 align:middle line:84%
asked to do that
is because I have

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:11.500 align:middle line:84%
a proven database, old
track record of my accuracy.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.770 align:middle line:84%
They would never ask
a person who doesn't

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:17.390 align:middle line:90%
have that proven track record--

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: --to do that,
because it could start a war.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you remote
viewed other planets?

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ingo remote viewed
the far side of the moon.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
He believes there are structures
there and things like that.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: There are.

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:30.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
done that, too?

00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Past civilizations?

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.287 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would do that?

00:48:37.287 --> 00:48:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: On Mars.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.480 align:middle line:90%
They were there.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.850 align:middle line:90%


00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.430 align:middle line:90%
Not really advanced, but yeah.

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:47.230 align:middle line:90%
They were there.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.854 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has,
in everything you've

00:48:48.854 --> 00:48:53.826 align:middle line:84%
done with remote viewing, Lyn,
been the most astounding thing

00:48:53.826 --> 00:48:54.950 align:middle line:90%
you think you've ever done?

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.417 align:middle line:90%


00:48:57.417 --> 00:48:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: The most astounding?

00:48:58.750 --> 00:48:59.583 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Astounding.

00:48:59.583 --> 00:49:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Just blew your mind.

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Three
things come to mind.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:10.800 align:middle line:84%
One, I had been
doing the bad guys

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and doing plans and
intentions of the bad guys.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was wearing them.

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.760 align:middle line:90%
It was wearing me down.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And I went into the director.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, give
me Bozo the clown.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Give me Mother Teresa
or something, but--

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.211 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give me something fun.

00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: --quit giving
me these God-awful people.

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:30.930 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Depressing.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: --so the
director, of course, said hey,

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:35.940 align:middle line:90%
you're a soldier.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Do your job.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Get out of my office.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And about a week
later, I got a target.

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
personality assessment,

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:51.510 align:middle line:84%
not plans and intentionments,
where you get into their mind.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Just a personality assessment.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:50:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly I said
this is not a bad guy.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.750 align:middle line:90%
This is a good guy.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:09.210 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the session,
almost my entire summary was,

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.467 align:middle line:84%
whatever evil you think this
guy did, he didn't do it.

00:50:11.467 --> 00:50:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He didn't--

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And I felt
like I was just glowing.

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And the monitor took the tasking
out of the sealed envelope

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.760 align:middle line:90%
and it said Jesus.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And in a very real way at that
level, I met the actual Jesus.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.400 align:middle line:90%
It changed my life.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You met--

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: That one--

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --Jesus?

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Well, in that way.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:41.353 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a sense.

00:50:41.353 --> 00:50:43.482 align:middle line:90%


00:50:43.482 --> 00:50:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: That
session changed my life.

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:47.480 align:middle line:90%
It really did.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.640 align:middle line:90%
OK, that was one.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Another-- the Russians were
developing a death ray,

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.700 align:middle line:90%
a particle beam weapon.

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Tesla?

00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of our customers
wanted to know what

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:07.200 align:middle line:90%
was going on inside the beam.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, you put an
instrument in there.

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:12.960 align:middle line:84%
In a millionth of a
second, it's vaporized.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:17.989 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And so they wanted
to see if a remote viewer could

00:51:17.989 --> 00:51:20.280 align:middle line:84%
step inside the beam and tell
what's going on in there.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without getting hurt.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, cool.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:26.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.800 align:middle line:90%
And so I volunteered to do it.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.300 align:middle line:84%
The most beautiful thing
I've ever seen in my life.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The beam?

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: The beam.

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Inside the beam.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And inside the beam, time
itself was totally screwed up.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And the experience
I had in there--

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I finally gathered
the presence of mind

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.200 align:middle line:84%
to tell what was going
on inside the beam

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.610 align:middle line:90%
with the particles and all that.

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But it was the most
amazing experience

00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I've ever had in my life,
totally indescribable.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.200 align:middle line:84%
The third one was one time
I was doing a session.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.140 align:middle line:90%
And there's a phase 7.

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:90%
That said phase 6.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.740 align:middle line:90%
There is a phase 7.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:19.080 align:middle line:90%
And a phase 7 where--

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.100 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to explain.

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I was working along.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I was in the room by myself.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like somebody
bent over my ear,

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:30.117 align:middle line:84%
bent over my shoulder
and whispered in my ear,

00:52:30.117 --> 00:52:31.950 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
believe what comes next.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:34.650 align:middle line:90%


00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I had learned by that
time-- write it down.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote it
down and went--

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:42.690 align:middle line:84%
continued on with my
session, found out

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:47.940 align:middle line:84%
that Saddam Hussein
had a US missile

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.860 align:middle line:90%
that he had stolen, basically--

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: --and had
it aimed for the Hajj

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.060 align:middle line:84%
there for the Feast
of Ramadan, where

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.491 align:middle line:90%
all the leaders circle around.

00:53:01.491 --> 00:53:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was going
to blow them all up?

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.115 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: He was going
to blow them all up,

00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:12.470 align:middle line:84%
leaving him to be the leader of
the Muslim world and with proof

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that it was an American
missile and therefore--

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did it.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:16.600 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah, but it
was him that was doing it.

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.880 align:middle line:90%
But he had that plan.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.170 align:middle line:90%
And I never heard any--

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I never got any proof, any
facts, or any data on it.

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But I heard from the DIA
later that it was accurate.

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:37.640 align:middle line:84%
They found the missile,
and it was his plan.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lyn, for
people who want

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:40.850 align:middle line:84%
to go through your remote
viewing training program,

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:41.650 align:middle line:90%
what do they do?

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:42.800 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.550 align:middle line:10%
>>BUCHANAN: I have
finally found a platform

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:49.640 align:middle line:10%
to offer the course on.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:54.050 align:middle line:10%
I did lose 30 of those
videos for the basic course

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:55.320 align:middle line:10%
in this computer attack.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Crashed.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.014 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And so I'm in the
process, rebuilding those.

00:53:59.014 --> 00:54:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to have the course
out by the end of the month.

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they
find you, though?

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:06.755 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: My website
is crviewer.com.

00:54:06.755 --> 00:54:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's easy.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BUCHANAN: And I will be
announcing it on that website.

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:15.659 align:middle line:84%
I'll also be announcing it
on my Facebook web page.

00:54:15.659 --> 00:54:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can they
be coast to coast--

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:17.610 align:middle line:90%
our show?

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Yeah, hope so.

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:18.950 align:middle line:90%
We'll do that.

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:20.366 align:middle line:84%
Lyn, thanks for
being on the show.

00:54:20.366 --> 00:54:21.689 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Give me a call.

00:54:21.689 --> 00:54:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're one of
the best, my friend.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.563 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Oh, thank you.

00:54:24.563 --> 00:54:27.671 align:middle line:90%


00:54:27.671 --> 00:54:33.010 align:middle line:84%
In doing this in-depth
course, I want

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:36.610 align:middle line:84%
it to be something that's going
to get serious people doing

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.300 align:middle line:90%
good for the world.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.449 align:middle line:84%
That's the legacy I
really want to leave.

00:54:40.449 --> 00:54:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's the
legacy you are leaving.

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much--

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Real good.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --for being--

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BUCHANAN: Thank you.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.923 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --on the program.

00:54:44.923 --> 00:54:47.080 align:middle line:10%
Remote viewing-- it's a
subject that has always

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.490 align:middle line:10%
been dear to my heart.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I've practiced it.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.280 align:middle line:90%
I've dabbled with it.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can too, because
it is an incredible tool

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.420 align:middle line:90%
for your own life.

00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
