[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.940 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.612 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:13.620 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.460 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.645 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, we're back.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:10%
This is part two of our
edition with Chase Kloetzke

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:10%
as we talk about ufology.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:90%
She's also an author.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:84%
You've had fun writing,
Chase, haven't you--

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.574 align:middle line:84%
little kid books on UFOs
and things like that?

00:00:39.574 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHASE KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
"Admissible" was difficult.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:10%
I'm actually not a writer
and I didn't enjoy it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:10%
as much as I thought I would.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.577 align:middle line:10%
So thank goodness for my
publisher and co-author,

00:00:52.577 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:10%
Richard Dolan.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.966 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it almost
like UFOs for dummies?

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: No.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:10%
It's more about
investigation and how

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:10%
to get out there and really
do a professional job

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:10%
and what's required as an
investigator, what constitutes

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:10%
physical evidence, what is
admissibility, right down to,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:10%
how should we dress?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Should we all be in the black
t-shirts posing like this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:90%
with UFOs on our shirts?

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:90%
But if we want--

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pointing.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.708 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:84%
If we want to be
professional investigators

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and be taken seriously
by mainstream

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
media and scientific
community and the public eye,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:90%
we have to present that image.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost like
ghost hunting, isn't it?

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.134 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It's--

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or is it
more scientific?

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: George, it's--

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hey, ghosts are real.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.593 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I agree.

00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And I do do paranormal
investigations at times,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:90%
if I'm called and needed.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But again, I think ufology
has been here longer.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:84%
We have over 60 years in the
field as the modern boots

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, especially
after Project Blue Book

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:90%
closed in '69.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.225 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: It seemed like
that was a big push when

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:84%
people like me that just
joined the ranks to say,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.983 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look for myself.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we have
a lot more embedded

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and information on how
we get things done.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
We have government documents,
more physical evidence

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:84%
than, say, a paranormal
team would have.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:84%
There's no government documents
on that ghost activity

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
versus a military event such
as Rendlesham or Captain Salas'

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.870 align:middle line:90%
case.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the alien agenda is?

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We go
back and forth.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Because there's information
on all sides and we

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:90%
have to weigh everybody.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.770 align:middle line:84%
If they're a credible witness
and they're coming to you with,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:84%
they're all good or they're all
bad and this is reproductive

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and they're stealing our
babies and creating hybrids,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I think it's premature to
jump in a box too quickly.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you put it all
together, what again-- why

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
couldn't it be a bunch
of different agendas?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I kind of look at it
as if, say, you and I

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
discover intelligent
life on another planet

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and we come back.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And who would want to be on
that spaceship for the next time

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:90%
we go out?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Who would want to be with us?

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.662 align:middle line:84%
Virologists, biologists,
sociologists, scientists

00:03:19.662 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All kinds of people.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.828 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:03:21.828 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them
with their own agenda,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.879 align:middle line:90%
which is the most important--

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to them.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, and the
study of this new species

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:84%
we've found, much like we
do in the Chongos today

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:90%
when we find a new bug.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if
there just happens

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
to be that same
scenario, that if they're

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:84%
an advanced culture that has
all this intelligent technology,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
there would be many
agendas and many reasons

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:90%
to come at us the way they do.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
However, there's no
evidence one way or another.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:90%
So we're still working.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physical planets,
extraterrestrial dimensions,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.960 align:middle line:90%
where are they coming from?

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I have a
hard time believing

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:84%
all of this is with, as I call
a full tank of gas and a Red

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Bull, or we'd have thousands
of amateur astronomers watching

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
them come into our
atmosphere constantly.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%
So they must be using--

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless they
dematerialize and materialize.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Sure.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely--

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.898 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's possible.

00:04:18.898 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: --which
is most likely.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:84%
However, we also
have accounts where

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:90%
they're coming through walls.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.237 align:middle line:84%
Beings are appearing,
objects on the ground.

00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ooooo-oooo.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And all that tells, us
when you're constantly

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
hearing decades and
decades of, again,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.700 align:middle line:84%
the most credible witnesses
giving you accounts of things

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that are just unbelievable--
in the '40s and '50s

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
when we talked about
dimensions and time travel,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:84%
of course we saw where
that led, into kind

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.067 align:middle line:84%
of the cartoony
sci-fi effected take.

00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: And
yet, it's possible.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
We're so close
now that I believe

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
the answers to the
extraterrestrial hypothesis

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
will be the quantum
physics or the people that

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:90%
had the contact themselves.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
We learn so much from
the people that claim

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:90%
to have abductions or contact.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:90%
What were you told?

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.657 align:middle line:84%
So these are all important
clues to put together a puzzle.

00:05:14.657 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there's no
question something's going on.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Even if 99% of the cases were
natural or created by man,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
that's 1% that is
unusual, extraterrestrial.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:84%
I've got this long
running argument

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
with Linda Moulton Howe, our
investigative reporter who's

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:90%
an expert on crop formations.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well, 20% to 25%
of them are real, unexplained.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And I said, that's pretty high.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:90%
But she gets all upset.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
But I said, Linda,
all you need is one.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.024 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just one.

00:05:47.024 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.119 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's the same
in the field of ufology--

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:90%
just one.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.503 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Well, and
if you think in-- just

00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:56.712 align:middle line:84%
MUFON alone gets about, on an
average, 900 reports a month.

00:05:56.712 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mutual
UFO Network, right?

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.277 align:middle line:84%
1% to 5%, which I think it's
more around 5% of these are--

00:06:04.277 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Davenport
gets more, I think.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Probably.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.778 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:06:07.778 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Peter has done a great job
with that database out there.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:90%
MUFON investigates.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is a big push right
now, is to get people actually

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:90%
But the data is important.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:84%
We need to start
taking this information

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.222 align:middle line:84%
and putting it together and
do some scientific studies.

00:06:26.222 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No doubt about that.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.134 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:06:28.134 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:90%
There's so much.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
your trip to Peru.

00:06:30.508 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:90%
What were you looking for?

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: The trip to
Peru, sometimes things

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:84%
fall in your lap and you wonder
why, and this was one of them.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.625 align:middle line:84%
And LA Marzulli and
Richard Shaw of Watchers--

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good people.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I love the work that he's
doing on the Torah codes.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
But when we went down, it
was a different expedition.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:84%
We were going down
to Peru and Bolivia

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
to study the elongated skulls
that we've been hearing

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:90%
so much about-- the giants.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the giants
being a hybrid race

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:90%
of fallen angels and humans.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's a theory that think
that these elongated skulls

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:84%
have something to do with that,
whether they're born that way,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
it's genetic, or probably
physical evidence

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:84%
of this hybrid race or
the emulation of-- LA

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:24.090 align:middle line:84%
says often, what makes a very
intelligent sophisticated race

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
wake up on a Monday
and say, you know what?

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's elongate our heads?

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:90%
Wanna?

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.903 align:middle line:90%
How can we do that?

00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:29.694 align:middle line:90%
They're emulating--

00:07:29.694 --> 00:07:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.072 align:middle line:90%
Let's stretch the baby.

00:07:32.072 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think so.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Peru is fascinating.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:90%
It is such a different culture.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, it's
still third world.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And we had such a great time
because we stayed off the grid.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So although we started in the
specific pyramids in Lima,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.671 align:middle line:84%
which there are over 1,000
pyramids just in Lima, Peru

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.170 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.506 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible
place of antiquity

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that still, a lot of
it's undiscovered.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
But we also found
ourselves off the track.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And there was one part where we
were going down to the Chongos.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's a necropolis the
whole desert area is just

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:90%
covered in human remains.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:90%
It's the crazy--

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean
bones everywhere?

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Antique--

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sacrifices?

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: No.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.419 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
a burial place.

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
threw 'em in there, huh?

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.626 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: A
burial place where I

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.994 align:middle line:84%
think huaqueros they call
them, or grave robbers, go in.

00:08:23.994 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking
for anything--

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Digging it
up and everything?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.746 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:08:26.746 --> 00:08:28.455 align:middle line:84%
And the bones just
get scattered.

00:08:28.455 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they buried
them with jewelry and things

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:90%
like that, didn't they?

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Actually, a very
beautiful type of burial.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Most of them in the Inca
and the Paracas culture

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.970 align:middle line:84%
are buried in a seated
position with their knees up.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So you find a lot of
mummies still like this.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Their knees are
under their chin.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:90%
They're in just a little shirt.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a very revered process.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And at this time,
we were going down

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
because the whole goal was to
really scientifically study

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.880 align:middle line:84%
the elongated skulls of
Paracas for the first time.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we had done.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But on the way-- there's
a really great story.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:90%
We're going to Chongos.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.107 align:middle line:90%
And we met--

00:09:05.107 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chongos sounds
like a Mexican restaurant.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.856 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's down by Pisco
and it's south of Paracas.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And we met with the mayor and
he gave us a police escort.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.615 align:middle line:90%
So we have armed guards--

00:09:18.615 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.989 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:19.989 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: --taking
us to this place.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And we get out and you have
all this lush farmland.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And then literally,
bam, just like--

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it is.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah-- we
would see a highway here,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:84%
they'd have this
humongous desert area.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're walking out there
and here's this step pyramid,

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:90%
100% not on the grid.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't been documented yet.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And we walk on top
of the step pyramid.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And the mayor proceeds to tell
LA and I about a UFO encounter

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:90%
that he knew of.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.242 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That he had.

00:09:51.242 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Well, that he
knew of in the village.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.325 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: And that
the people that lived by

00:09:55.325 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:84%
watched this craft
come several times

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and literally take the
water from the lake that

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:90%
used to be there.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's just so
interesting when you

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
have a culture that's
not afraid to tell you

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:90%
anything about UFOs.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.024 align:middle line:84%
There was no ridicule or
whispers or even fear of it.

00:10:13.024 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very
comfortable with it.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:90%
They know they're there.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
back into antiquity.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I know LA Marzulli's done a lot
of work on the Book of Genesis

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and what it meant
in his DVD series

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.934 align:middle line:84%
"The Watchers," which I believe
he's got "Watchers 8" out now.

00:10:29.934 --> 00:10:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he keeps going.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
What does that tell you about
what might have happened

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.536 align:middle line:90%
during those days of antiquity?

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Honestly, the
elongated skulls really

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle line:84%
tell a lot of the story, which
is, again, you have cultures

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.910 align:middle line:90%
behaving very differently.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.319 align:middle line:90%
And they're talking about Gods.

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:10%
They're talking
about those that came

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:10%
from the heavens, their wings--
they were winged as angels.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:10%
And even when we were in
Bolivia and went to Puma Punku

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:10%
and Tiwanaku, we had
pictures, and you're

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:10%
seeing first time
the Gate of the Sun

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:10%
and the gallery of
the different heads

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:10%
and the megalithic
structures, it's just amazing.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And you're just awestruck.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:84%
But it becomes very clear
that certain things were

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:90%
meant to tell you something.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Certain things were
very prominent.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And you see Viracocha
at one point,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:84%
who has very Caucasian
features, and even

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.790 align:middle line:84%
a beard and a
moustache at one point.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And then he's featured
again on this gateway

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of little
winged beings around him.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Is that his court?

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:90%
His children?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Are they just part-- but
they were very precise.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you go into
Tiwanaku and you

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:90%
go into this little gallery.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And it shows what
appears to be heads,

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.522 align:middle line:84%
all different shapes and
sizes, all different features.

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the first
things I recognized

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:84%
is they're obviously
capable of exact replication

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because all the little winged
beings over here are exact.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But here, it's very
purposefully very different.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So you're learning a lot about
the culture and the message

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to say.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's-- maybe we
shouldn't be interpreting it

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and take it for
exactly what it is.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:90%
So there was a lot of--

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's perplexing.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:33.999 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It is.

00:12:33.999 --> 00:12:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And to see that
they were talking

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:84%
about gods walking among
them, beings transversing

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
in and out, the watchers--
some of the shamans that we've

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
seen since and interview and
other things that have come out

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
actually use the word--
it's the Spanish word,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:90%
but it interprets as "Watchers."

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:90%
They're not saying Gods.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So really, a lot of this has
to do with what's going on.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're in the ancient,
it's so reminiscent of angels

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and not so much flesh and
blood extraterrestrials.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.030 align:middle line:84%
You take these
wings and you have

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:84%
the theories that
say that they didn't

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:90%
know how to describe a UFO.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.070 align:middle line:90%
How did they describe that?

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:20.176 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:20.176 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:90%
How did they describe it?

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
As something angelic
or something like that.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they left
exactly what they saw

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:90%
and maybe this is true.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if it was
a fallen angel,

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:90%
they want to be worshiped.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:90%
They want to be godlike.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So it would be very easy to
convince a culture, well, yeah,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.960 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to think I'm
a god, go ahead and worship me

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'll take those
accolades while I continue

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:90%
my cosmic or bad agenda.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.272 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something was
going on a long time ago.

00:13:51.272 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding these pyramids
through the latest technology

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
of military infrared
satellite imaging coming down.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're finding
huge complexes

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:07.920 align:middle line:84%
underwater and in Alaska and
all these new structures.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're finding that
they're very similar.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.930 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of the
comparisons before of Egypt

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:90%
and the Mayan culture.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And now we're finding
them all over the world.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:90%
So what does that say?

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.962 align:middle line:84%
It says we had a completely
sophisticated, intelligent--

00:14:25.962 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Network.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.063 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah,
already, that--

00:14:28.063 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was out there.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: --had a
technology which we believe

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
has more to do with energy
grids and technology.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And here we are still
running our wires

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
all over the Earth for energy
that's probably right there.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And we know it is because of
the Ley lines and the graphing

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:90%
that we've done.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chase,
more and more people

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:51.172 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to believe in
this alien abduction phenomena.

00:14:51.172 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something strange
is happening to these people.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:90%
We don't know exactly what.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:84%
All we know is
something's happening.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:90%
What do you think is going on?

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I think
that there is a plan.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.134 align:middle line:90%
Again, it seems to be more--

00:15:08.134 --> 00:15:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An evil plan?

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.758 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I think
there's more evidence

00:15:10.758 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:84%
to the angelic
manipulation of DNA.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84%
If the flood really
happened because God wanted

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.272 align:middle line:90%
to absolutely get rid of--

00:15:19.272 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And eradicate.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes-- and
bring back his creation

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
of what he believed was pure
human bloodline-- which is

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:90%
awesome, because we have flaws.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:90%
We're different.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:90%
We have dark hair.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
We're tall, short,
and all of this.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:90%
And yet--

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All colors, all
just about everything.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you had a
bad agenda or you

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:84%
were cast out of the
heavens and came down here--

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
we have to remember
angels are eternal.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:90%
They're powerful.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:84%
They're obviously intelligent
and different enough

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
that they can
transverse dimensions

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
or they can travel back and
forth, heavens and earth.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
If we look at
angels the same way,

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:84%
with the same interests
as aliens or beings

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
from another planet,
I think we're

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
going to find a whole
lot more of the story.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to hybridisation,

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm really nervous
about that because--

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
making a little army?

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: That's the theory.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the theory, is that we--

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That they're going to
come back one day with millions

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.244 align:middle line:90%
and millions of these hybrids?

00:16:23.244 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And just say,
you humans are gone.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You're incapable of taking
care of this planet.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:90%
You're warmongers.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:90%
You're gone.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: That's
the hypothesis.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're bringing
in this peaceful group

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:84%
to start a new existence
on this planet.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:37.786 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:16:37.786 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It is possible.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.434 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on who's
behind the genetic--

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Manipulation?

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.016 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, or
the genetic design.

00:16:45.016 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And even now, even in our growth
in technology and understanding

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
of DNA coding and
genomes, we're perfecting.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:90%
We're perfecting.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if
that's a good idea either.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I know we're flawed.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:84%
And who wouldn't want to
take out birth defects?

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like what
the Nazis tried to do, right?

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.206 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Exactly, George.

00:17:08.206 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you think about
the contact stories

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
we hear of the '40s and '50s
and earlier or the Nordics,

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
where they're all beautiful,
blonde, blue eyed.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:90%
We have heard that before.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I like
us kind of all

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.366 align:middle line:90%
over the place and different.

00:17:23.366 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're a
different kind--

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.448 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:17:25.448 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --different species.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But the agenda-- let's get back
to David Jacobs for a moment.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
He believes this entire program
is for evil, very nefarious

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:90%
purposes.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:90%
I tend to believe that.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I do, too, because
I have no evidence of anything

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Where is the good thing?

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes down
to when we take the UFO

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
phenomena realistically, is
it really our government?

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Do we have proof that our
government's covering it up?

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
We know somebody's
covering it up.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:84%
But is anybody
asking the question

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:84%
if it's our decision
to begin with?

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe extraterrestrials
hold that card

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and we're not allowed to say.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think that they
have the technology that they

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
could come down-- they could
park an object in Central Park

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:90%
any moment, and they don't.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And everything they
do is in the darkness.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything they do is at
night and behind the scenes.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem
to be cloaking this.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.901 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:25.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How come?

00:18:25.445 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Why don't want us to
know about it directly?

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: This is probably
our biggest question and what

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to discover now.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.228 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
that's going to come

00:18:33.228 --> 00:18:36.871 align:middle line:84%
through taking a realistic
look at the phenomena.

00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always been
told that secret things mean

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:90%
you're up to no good.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
any kind of agenda.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But even our technology is
just going through the roof.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to keep up.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard to keep up.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just wonder
where we're going

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:84%
or if we're being led
in that direction.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Disclosure-- I
don't think it's coming.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I absolutely
agree with you.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:84%
There is no reason for
the United States--

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
even if other
countries come out,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:84%
there's just no benefit
for the United States

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:90%
to make this known.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.494 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:10.494 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:90%
We gain nothing.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely nothing.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.744 align:middle line:90%
Even if they come out and say--

00:19:14.744 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then they
have to explain

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:90%
why they've been hiding it.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Or imagine, really,
what would society do?

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Would it really collapse?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.959 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it would.

00:19:23.959 --> 00:19:25.541 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, but I
think what we would

00:19:25.541 --> 00:19:26.667 align:middle line:90%
do is we'd question things.

00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:27.332 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'd say,
where's our free energy?

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Where's our long term health?

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you do this for us?

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't we doing this?

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And government doesn't want
to have to explain that.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Or the institutions.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.088 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want to explain

00:19:39.088 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, we could've given
you free energy 40 years ago.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
We can't because there are too
many energy companies making

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.162 align:middle line:90%
money off of you.

00:19:46.162 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then what happens?

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.408 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:19:49.408 --> 00:19:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the UFO phenomena
is probably the most important,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:84%
because to understand
exactly what's going

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:90%
on changes everything.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Not to slight ghost
hunting or Bigfoot,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
but to find an undiscovered
species on this planet,

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.505 align:middle line:90%
it'd be pretty cool.

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd love it.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: But it
doesn't change everything.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.486 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: To
find out the agenda

00:20:10.486 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:84%
of what is going on-- because
we do know something is.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:90%
That's no longer a debate.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:90%
It's what is going on?

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to do with humans.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:90%
What is our role in this?

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Which it's obvious we
have one, but maybe humans

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.220 align:middle line:90%
would like a say in that.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would say
the so-called lights

00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, most of
them probably are just

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.922 align:middle line:90%
lights in the sky.

00:20:30.922 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Our technology, secret--

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Planes, whatever.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I agree.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I think the
phenomena mostly will

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
things that we've

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:84%
been hearing from our witnesses
in the modernity of collecting

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:90%
UFO data.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is they're often
plagued with paranormal type

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:90%
experiences after.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.307 align:middle line:84%
They experience
high strangeness.

00:20:51.307 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.889 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: There's a lot
of reasons that this--

00:20:53.889 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some illnesses.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.035 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:56.035 --> 00:20:57.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What keeps
driving you, Chase?

00:20:57.659 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Why do you keep pursuing this?

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It's the truth.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK where the
truth takes us in the end

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.004 align:middle line:90%
as long as it's the truth.

00:21:06.004 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
we know the truth?

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I think it's
going to become very apparent

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and there's got
to be a time when

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:90%
it's just undeniable anymore.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of my colleagues
like Richard Dolan and--

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love Richard.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Dear friend.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.088 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:21:21.088 --> 00:21:21.936 align:middle line:90%
He's awesome.

00:21:21.936 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us
will get together

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and we talk constantly
about what would it take?

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:90%
What would prove it?

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:90%
What do people need?

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Is it really a vehicle on the
White House lawn or capturing

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.514 align:middle line:90%
an alien or whatever it is?

00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's going
to be better than that.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I hope that we discover a
science in quantum physics

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:49.200 align:middle line:84%
that proves other realities
that then we can go and explore.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
most of the evidence

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:84%
now points to exactly what
you and I already believe.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:84%
We keep our biases
out or our opinions

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:84%
outside when we're walking
into every new investigation,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.970 align:middle line:84%
but there's every
reason to believe

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.717 align:middle line:84%
this doesn't necessarily
turn out great for humans.

00:22:08.717 --> 00:22:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever get the
answers we're looking for?

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.187 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, because
we're not going to quit.

00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We need
more people like you.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: We do.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
We need more boots on
the ground and people

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.650 align:middle line:84%
that are going to go not just
what I call entertainment

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:90%
investigating.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Just don't--

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
a lot of that.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole lot of that.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:90%
We need real researchers.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.229 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have a degree
in physics and I'm not a--

00:22:29.229 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you need one?

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: No.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of a housewife.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.091 align:middle line:84%
I'm a biomechanics
engineer that's--

00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The housewife
who looks for UFOs.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Exactly.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.300 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But you get out there
and you just partner

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:84%
with people with the
integrity and the scrutiny.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And you want the
science behind it.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:84%
You want rational,
critical thinkers

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:84%
out here that work the
problems, just like an engineer.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:90%
We get a case.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.890 align:middle line:84%
That evidence didn't
prove to be anything.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Then let it be.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.994 align:middle line:90%
We found the truth.

00:23:03.994 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're doing.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:10%
So even if we-- they
call it debunking here.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:10%
I call it doing your job.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:10%
And if we find out that it is
something that's very natural,

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.040 align:middle line:10%
that's the truth
of that event, it's

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:10%
a successful investigation.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm not looking here for UFOs.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for the truth.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:90%
