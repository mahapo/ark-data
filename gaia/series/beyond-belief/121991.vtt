>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:10%
In this edition of
"Beyond Belief,"

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.650 align:middle line:10%
we're going to be talking about
something that will affect

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.430 align:middle line:10%
all of us, life after death.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And how many of us have
been skeptics, nonbelievers,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:84%
thinking when you
die that is it?

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest on "Beyond
Belief", too, was a skeptic,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:90%
but things changed for him.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Things changed dramatically
with his after death experience.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.839 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FEMALE VOICEOVER: He
says he has glimpsed

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:84%
the divine, an orb of light
brighter than a million suns,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:84%
all powerful, all loving,
a being beyond words.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Eben Alexander recounts
his remarkable near-death

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:10%
experience in the New York Times
bestseller "Proof of Heaven:

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.239 align:middle line:10%
A Neurosurgeon's Journey
Into the Afterlife."

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, Alexander suffered
a meningitis induced coma

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:90%
and nearly died.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
The out-of-body experience
he had in that state

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
is proof that consciousness
is independent of the body.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Alexander continues
to probe consciousness

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and looks to transcend the
limitations of the brain

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:84%
in his latest book,
"The Map of Heaven:

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
How Science, Religion,
and Ordinary People

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:90%
are Proving the Afterlife."

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that's pretty
fascinating so welcome

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
to "Beyond Belief"
Dr. Eben Alexander.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:10%
What a should I say
life you've had?

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:10%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: It's been
quite a life, especially when

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:10%
you realize as I often say
no one gets out of here dead.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.855 align:middle line:84%
That's really the
truth of the matter.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eben, tell me a
little bit about the skepticism

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that you had prior
to these episodes.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: Well I had
grown up in a family

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:10%
with my father having
a tremendous influence

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:10%
on my life.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:10%
He was the head of a
neurosurgical training program,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:10%
very scientific.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:10%
He also had a very
strong faith in God.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:10%
For him there was
never any doubt.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.340 align:middle line:10%
When he operated on a patient
and the patient did well,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:10%
it was really God's work.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the '60s and
'70s, and like many others

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
in that generation I
always knew that science

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.205 align:middle line:90%
is the pathway to truth.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.005 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And I
had wanted to believe

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:84%
what I heard in church
growing up in a Methodist

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Church in North Carolina, but
20 years spent in neurosurgery

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I just wasn't sure how a
conscious awareness could

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:84%
survive the death of
the brain and body.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's why my
experience, which happened back

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.300 align:middle line:84%
in November 2008,
shifted everything.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Because in fact,
such a severe case

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
of gram negative
bacterial meningitis

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:84%
should have disabled all but
the most rudimentary aspects

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and
yet my consciousness

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
was greatly enhanced
during the experience when

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
the human part of my
brain, the neocortex,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:90%
was being devastated.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And that completely
violated everything

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I had learned in neuroscience
about consciousness

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:84%
in the brain and it
really has come to show me

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:90%
that the material is wrong.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's parallel to
a lot of what's happening today

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:84%
in the notion of philosophy
of mind and understanding

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.422 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
makes much more sense.

00:03:17.422 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what "Proof of
Heaven" and "Map of Heaven"

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:90%
are all about.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in St.
Louis, the county executive

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
at the time, Buzz Westfall,
came down with meningitis

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and they put him
in an induced coma

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
while they were trying
to get him well again

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and he just never
came out of it.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It was a horrible situation
and I've always wondered,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Eben, that when you're in
that state of unconsciousness,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.320 align:middle line:90%
is the mind really still moving?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Are you dreaming?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:84%
What's going on at that
point and what is he

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.337 align:middle line:90%
seeing when that's going on?

00:03:50.337 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I think
that the interesting thing is

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:10%
when you finally
begin to understand,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.660 align:middle line:10%
as much of our current science
is coming to understand,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:10%
that the physical brain is
not creating consciousness out

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:10%
of physical matter but there is
something much more perplexing

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:10%
going on.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:10%
Whereas, in fact, the
brain should better

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:10%
be viewed as a reducing
valve or filter.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, but
we're conscious in spite

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:90%
of our brain.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Te neocortex, I
believe, is the part

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that actually handles a lot
of that filtering mechanism.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:84%
But consciousness is
something that's allowed in.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness from my point
of view is primordial.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness preexists
the entire universe,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and in fact all of
the material universe

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
is built on the substrate of
consciousness is fundamental.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
current revolution

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:84%
in kind of brain science
and the mind-body discussion

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
is so interesting and of
so much power to all of us

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's showing us what
quantum mechanics has tried

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
to show us for 100 years,
which is consciousness

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.449 align:middle line:84%
is fundamental in everything
that evolves in this universe.

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've had arguments
on "Coast to Coast,"

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
my radio show, with scientists
about that very question, that

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.010 align:middle line:84%
without the brain does
consciousness still exist?

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And some hard
scientists will say, no,

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have the
physical brain in order

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:90%
to make this happen.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:90%
But I agree with you.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that it exists
outside of the physical realm,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.846 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Right, exactly.

00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that we can come to see,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:84%
especially those who are
with patients who die.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:90%
That's where the real action is.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
If you want to find
out what's going on,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:84%
talk to hospice
nurses, nurses in ICUs,

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:84%
things like that because they
got this a long time ago.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
They see enough evidence
when a patient passes over

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that it's not simply
the end of everything

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
when a physical body
dies, but it's actually

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:90%
a release of the soul.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, what I would say
is that conscious awareness

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:84%
is greatly enhanced
when it's freed up

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:84%
from the shackles of the
physical brain, completely

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle line:90%
outside of space and time.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a much richer,
more profound existence.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And yet the interesting
thing is that when

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:84%
we come into these bodies,
because I believe that it all

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
has to do with reincarnation, we
don't just have one incarnation

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and then it's heaven
or hell forever

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.430 align:middle line:90%
and that's the end of it.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, we come
back again and again

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:90%
in our process of ascendance.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.029 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is how we forget.

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:90%
There is that forgetting.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Now children, I think, are very
much walking in two worlds.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Very young children, they're
living in that spiritual realm

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:90%
and in this earthly realm.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem to remember
a little better than we do.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.625 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: They remember.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:34.079 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing to see.

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you're open
to that, you start

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
to realize that in infants
and young children,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that they are seeing these
other aspects, other beings.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
our culture unfortunately

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:90%
kind of drills out of us.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.444 align:middle line:84%
And that's to the detriment
of Western culture

00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
because other
cultures, of course,

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
have maintained that
knowledge of a continuity

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:90%
and the eternity of soul.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But our Western
culture, especially

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:84%
under the yoke of
scientific materialism,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
has lost that sense of
the nature of reality.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eben, tell us a little
bit about this experience that

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
happened to you, the
moment you got sick

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and then what happened when
you finally came out of it?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, it's
important to point out

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:84%
that my near-death
experience, although it

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.140 align:middle line:84%
has many of the
hallmarks of other kind

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of deep transcendental
in the East,

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:84%
it has one fairly
atypical feature and that

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:84%
is that I was amnesic for
the life of Eben Alexander

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:90%
in the midst of it all.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And that all served
a major purpose.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
It took me months and even
years to really appreciate.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, it
all started in what

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I call the earthworm-eye view,
a very primitive, coarse,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
unresponsive realm, like being
in dirty Jell-O with roots

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:90%
or blood vessels all around me.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And that seemed to go
on for a very long time.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.995 align:middle line:10%
Now, when I first came back to
this world and wrote it all up,

00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:10%
I thought that that
earthworm-eye view,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:10%
as I called it, was simply
the best consciousness

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:10%
my physical brain
could muster when

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:10%
the neocortex was
being destroyed

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:10%
by bacterial meningitis.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that
didn't last forever.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I was rescued by a slowly
spinning, very clear

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
white light with fine
gold and silver tendrils

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
coming off of it and it had
a perfect musical melody.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And as it came towards
me, slowly spinning,

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.420 align:middle line:84%
it opened up like
a rip in the fabric

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:84%
of that ugly earthworm-eye
view, the coarse realm,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and led up into this
brilliant ultra real valley,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:90%
what I call the Gateway Valley.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, its Gateway because it
was only kind of the entry

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.539 align:middle line:84%
point to multiple levels going
all the way out to the core.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But that I believe,
that Gateway Valley,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:84%
is the same realm that I
believe all spiritually

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:84%
journeyers as into the spiritual
realm over thousands of years

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
have encountered
that same thing.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's often put
together and then

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:84%
we come back with some
of our prior beliefs

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and our personal mindset
kind of shaping it.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And our words and
language reflect that.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, when you read
many of these accounts,

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:84%
thousands of these
accounts, what stands out

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:90%
are the similarities.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my particular
case, that Gateway Valley,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:84%
I was a speck of awareness
on a butterfly wing.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
There were millions
of other butterflies

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and they were flying in
these looping spirals

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.919 align:middle line:84%
and they were of colors
beyond the rainbow.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
being in a kaleidoscope.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: It was very
much like a kaleidoscope.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And then flying down
into that lush greenery.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
This valley was absolutely
fertile, rich, lush

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:90%
with life and creation.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:90%
No sign of any death or decay.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And going into that, I remember
sensing the flowers, buds,

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:90%
blossoms on trees.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything was always opening
dynamic, creative, blooming,

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:90%
every bit of it.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And down below in this
belly were thousands

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
of what I call in my
early writings villagers,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.310 align:middle line:90%
they were souls between lives.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Lots of joy and dancing,
merriment, children playing,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:90%
dogs jumping.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean incredible
festivities and it was all

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:84%
being driven because
up above were

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
these golden orbs
of light swooping,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.120 align:middle line:84%
leaving sparkling trails against
that blue-black velvety sky.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And all the scene lit by these
billowing clouds of color.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the best part
about it was I wasn't alone.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:84%
In everything I
witnessed in that realm

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:84%
there was a partner
on that butterfly wing

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
who I came to call my guardian
angel, a beautiful woman.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget
how she looked at me,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:84%
how she was sitting,
how she was dressed--

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of
peasant garb as--

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they have wings?

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: No, she
didn't have wings

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:84%
but she was sitting
there with me.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
We were sitting on
what I interpreted

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
as butterfly wings or a
magic carpet or whatever,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:90%
but something like that.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But she was just sitting
there looking as angelic

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.010 align:middle line:90%
as could be, but no wings.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And her message to me, I
believe is such a central part

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:84%
of the message from
the book, "Proof

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
of Heaven" to this world
of my story, which is you

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:84%
are deeply loved and
cherished forever.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:90%
You will be taken care of.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.500 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing to fear.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And those are the most
fundamentally important lessons

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:90%
of the journey.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the soft
breeze that blew through

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that in my early writings
I called the breath of God

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:90%
or divine wind.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:90%
And that was my first knowing.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I was
completely amnesic

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
for anything of Eben Alexander's
life-- no words, no language,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
no religious concepts,
none of that.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So that soft breeze was my
first awareness of the divine

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and of the infinite loving power
of the divine through every bit

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
of this, the lower
four-dimensional space-time

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
realms, this
Gateway Valley which

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
actually had a completely
different temporal flow

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:90%
and causality.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And all of that going on.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:84%
What happened next
was once again,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
the angelic choirs, the
music, sound, vibration

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
provided yet another portal up
into higher and higher levels.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going
through several levels

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.340 align:middle line:84%
of spatial and
temporal dimensions

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
until I got out to
what I call the core.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
The core, infinite, inky
blackness, but filled

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
to overflowing with
that infinite healing

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
power of unconditional love of
the creator for the creation.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This just
illuminated you.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: It absolutely did.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Illumination is a
beautiful word to use

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
because in fact, the
paradox of that core realm,

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:84%
of that oneness, it's
kind of like the event

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:84%
horizon of a black hole where
you're right arm the very edge

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and going into that
oneness there is nothing

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
but the infinite oneness, all
of eternity, all of infinity,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:90%
the core driver of all that is.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But at that event
horizon, you can

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:84%
start to sense how it
all gets parceled out

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
into the incredible theater
of drama of sentient beings

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
throughout this universe
that are living these lives,

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:84%
discovering these lessons,
teaching these lessons.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And you end up seeing how this
is all really soul school.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But the most fundamental
lessons, of course,

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
have to do with that
unconditional love

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and coming to realize that
unconditional love has

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.160 align:middle line:84%
infinite power to
heal at all levels,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:84%
whether you're talking about
the individual soul, the soul

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:84%
group, nations, all of
humanity, all on life on Earth,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:84%
all the sentient civilizations
throughout the universe.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
That love has infinite
power to heal.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're with
Dr. Eben Alexander,

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
author of "Proof of Heaven"
and "Map of Heaven."

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And he experienced something
just truly remarkable.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, we went out on the streets
to talk to people about life

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:90%
after death, Eben.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a look with
me at some of their comments.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:27.906 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:13:27.906 --> 00:13:31.286 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.286 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: I don't
really think so.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: I believe
in heaven, so yes.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: It's not really
clear what it may be,

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:84%
but I believe in some
sort of life after death.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.055 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: I am not certain
about the afterlife.

00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: I think we split into
a million little souls, kind

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:84%
of like sand on
the beach, and then

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
it kind of collect
in the rocks, which

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
is like the incarnation
of our being.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: I believe what you do
during your life affects what

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.140 align:middle line:90%
you become in your afterlife.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's your physical
body that dies

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.121 align:middle line:90%
and your soul lives on forever.

00:14:06.121 --> 00:14:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Dr.
Alexander, what we just

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:84%
saw seemed to be a mixed
review of whether there

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:90%
is life after death.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think so many
people aren't in that position

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:84%
that you're in and I've
been in in terms of a belief

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:90%
that there is life after death?

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:84%
You had a lot of people there
that just weren't quite sure.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I think
it's in large measure

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:90%
due to our culture.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And we look at the scientists
as the arbiters of truth.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have largely
told us that the material

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
world is what is real, that's
what we're here to study.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:10%
The most fundamental field
in science in many ways

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:10%
is physics.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course physics has
built in that assumption

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that the only stuff
that is in this universe

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:90%
is the physical world.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:10%
And that's part of the
problem, because in fact,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:10%
what I would say is my journey
showed me very clearly--

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:10%
and this is where I see the
whole scientific world going--

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.700 align:middle line:10%
that we live in a
spiritual universe.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.346 align:middle line:84%
From the very top
down, bottom up,

00:15:09.346 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
however you want
to look at this,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
we are in a spiritual
universe that

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely alive with the
spiritual nature of who we are

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and what we're here to do
and what this is all about.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
The material world is actually
just the stage setting,

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.910 align:middle line:90%
it's the backdrop.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like the facade
and in a Western.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.740 align:middle line:84%
When Hollywood goes
out to shoot a Western

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.285 align:middle line:84%
you've got all the fronts
of the buildings there

00:15:30.285 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:84%
that makes it look
like that old town.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
physical reality is.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what's
really going on

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:84%
is a drama that has
everything to do

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:84%
with sentient beings being
here to learn and teach

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.090 align:middle line:84%
these lessons and the ascendance
and evolution of consciousness.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what's really happening.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So focus on physics
in the material world

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:84%
is really just focus
on the stage setting.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But each and every one of us are
truly eternal spiritual beings

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's the
most important lesson.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And our whole culture
will shift dramatically

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:90%
as we come to incorporate this.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's really being forced on
us by the truth, by the facts.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if you try to subscribe
to pure scientific materialism

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:84%
or physicalism, that the
physical is all that exists,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:84%
you end up running
into major problems.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
problems, of course,

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.740 align:middle line:84%
is the measurement problem
in quantum mechanics, which

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:84%
the physics community
has struggled

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:90%
with for more than 100 years.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And the way out of that
issue is through realizing

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that we are spiritual
beings, that consciousness

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is fundamental at driving
this entire universe.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet our physicists,
some of them,

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:84%
have a little difficulty
letting go of the simplicity

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.894 align:middle line:90%
of pure physicalism.

00:16:39.894 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm
impressed that you've

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:84%
taken a scientific look
at what happened to you

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're coming up
with those answers

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.220 align:middle line:84%
that those people
who have been very

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.100 align:middle line:84%
spiritual since the beginning
of time have always told us,

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and that is there is life
after death and it's out there.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, during this
experience that you had,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and it seemed to be
illuminating as we talked about

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and enlightening and
wholesome and heavenly,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:84%
but did you have any
glimpse of what could

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:90%
have been conceived as hell?

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
I would say if I

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
had gone into my
experience and just

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.900 align:middle line:84%
been through that
earthworm-eye view

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.089 align:middle line:84%
and come back to
this world, I would

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
have had a hellish NDE, very
simple and straightforward.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And you know the thing
is I cycled many a time.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I would go up, sound
vibrational frequency always

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:84%
offering the
portal, the gateway,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's an important
point because, of course,

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:84%
we used sound in
chants, in the resonance

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
of ancient structures,
et cetera to drive

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:90%
spiritual journeys forever.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And so sound was a
crucial part of it.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But I came to
realize that this was

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
very much a spiritual
journey that had no one

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:90%
no other explanation.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:07.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I assume
in your human life

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:84%
you were a pretty decent
guy, you were a good person.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.705 align:middle line:84%
If you weren't, would
that hellish experience

00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:90%
have been more magnified?

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.505 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
I think that's

00:18:23.505 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
the other important
point is life review.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Your life flashes
before your eyes.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not a new age
concept, it just

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:84%
has come up in the
last few decades

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.690 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experiences
because in fact,

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences
go back thousands

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.630 align:middle line:90%
of years across all cultures.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And the life review is a
crucial thing to understand.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean the near-death
experience of Er,

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:84%
the Armenian soldier
reported by Plato, here's

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
a soldier way back
2,300 years ago

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.360 align:middle line:84%
who came back to life after
a near-death experience

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and his message was,
when you go there,

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:84%
what happens is you review your
whole life and the only thing

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
that is important, as he
put it, is the love that you

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:90%
have manifested.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So what I came to
see in my journey

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.760 align:middle line:84%
is very clearly that
that unconditional love

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
is the straightest path of
ascendance towards oneness

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:90%
with the divine.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And we each have that free
will to make the choices

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:84%
in our lives of love,
compassion, forgiveness,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:90%
acceptance, mercy, or otherwise.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said
in "Proof of Heaven,"

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:90%
you can do no wrong.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But when I say do no
wrong, what that really

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:84%
means is be willing to
face the consequences,

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:90%
to reap what you sow.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
That life review
would look like hell

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to anyone who has spent
much of their life

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
dishing out pain and
suffering to others,

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:84%
has been greedy and selfish,
egocentric, fully self-focused.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
That's a guaranteed recipe for
a pretty hellish life review

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:84%
that then tends rectify
and kind of get you

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:90%
going in the right direction.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
in that life review

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:84%
the judgement is from our
higher soul and soul mates.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not from some higher
being, although when

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
you've been to the
core, to the one realm,

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:84%
what you realize is all
of consciousness is one.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:84%
We are all part of
that one consciousness

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and that one universal
consciousness

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:84%
is what is driving all of this
evolution of consciousness.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But there is no need
for an eternal hell.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
came back, we'll

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:84%
put it like that,
did it change you?

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Everything changed.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, first of all, important
to point out my doctors

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:90%
were right.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:84%
My meningitis was so severe
and had destroyed my neocortex

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
so effectively that when
I first started to wake up

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
in the ICU room, I had no
memory of Eben Alexander's life

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:84%
All I remembered was where
I had been in this journey

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and it had happened
over seven Earth days

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
long my coma was.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you had asked me then,
how long did all of this last?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Months, years, I don't know.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a very extensive
odyssey that I was on.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a very
crucial thing to understand.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:84%
My brain was wrecked, but I
didn't even recognize my loved

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:90%
ones at the bedside.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you contract this?

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: We never found out.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:84%
In "Proof of Heaven"
I talk a little bit

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
about some very
interesting facets

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:84%
because I had recently been to
Israel a few months earlier.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you were fine?

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: And I was fine.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:90%
I was fine.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So we never figured out
how I contracted it.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:90%
It was a deep mystery.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
It was a one in 10
million diagnosis,

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:84%
having E. coli
meningitis in an adult.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
That almost always
happens in newborns.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.144 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something you ate?

00:21:33.144 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, no.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:90%
We just never figured it out.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is I'm very
blessed to have this recovery.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a tremendous
gift, in fact,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:84%
because that kind of
destruction of the neocortex

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.270 align:middle line:84%
blew away all the simplistic
little pseudo explanations

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that modern science or
medicine would try and slap

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:90%
on to my experience.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there is
no way to explain

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
that kind of rich,
ultra real experience

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that I had in the Gateway
Valley and the core,

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.260 align:middle line:84%
given our general ideas that the
brain produces consciousness.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.768 align:middle line:84%
You have to turn it
around and look at it

00:22:06.768 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
the other way around,
which of course applies

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:84%
so well to so many other
near-death experiences, too.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I envy your
experience, but I

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:84%
don't envy what you had to
go through to get there.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
the good news is I try

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:90%
and go back there all the time.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I often
tell people is you

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:84%
don't have to die or almost
die to come to see everything

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.760 align:middle line:90%
that I know about this.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.460 align:middle line:90%
I meditate an hour or two a day.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
This is why I do that work
with sacred acoustics,

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:84%
to try and help
people get the tools.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Because all you need to
do is be a sentient being.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're conscious, you
can go within consciousness.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize the brain
does not create consciousness,

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:84%
but that consciousness
creates all of this world,

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
then you start to realize that
slipping beyond the veil that

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
is created by the
physical brain and getting

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:84%
into that universal and
infinite consciousness

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:90%
might offer up some real wisdom.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So that is why I encourage
people to meditate.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Take 20 minutes, an hour,
two hours a day if you can.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what I try to go.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Go inside.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Realize that that voice in
the head is not consciousness.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness
is aware, it's

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.950 align:middle line:84%
the observer of
that voice, but we

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.990 align:middle line:84%
are all far grander than
simply that one little voice

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:90%
in the head.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:90%
We are the observer of that.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of that
is interconnected

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's why that work
with sacred acoustics I think

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:84%
is so important to help get
these tools out to the world.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you get
close to the point

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:84%
where you thought
you may have met God?

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I would say I
not only met but became one

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:90%
with God.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.160 align:middle line:84%
That is what happens in that
core realm, in that oneness.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:10%
Now, the problem is
when you say that kind

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:10%
of thing in this world, people
want to lock you up or put

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.460 align:middle line:10%
your medication, give you
some Prozac or something

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:10%
and try and calm you down.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter
is the way I see it now,

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness is an
absolute and direct link

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
to that creative deity,
to that infinite oneness.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can all
come to know that.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:17.337 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, you leave
ego far, far behind

00:24:17.337 --> 00:24:18.170 align:middle line:90%
in this whole thing.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The boundaries of self
are false and that

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.060 align:middle line:84%
is what this is all about
is coming to a deeper

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
wisdom of what
consciousness truly is

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and coming to see that
we are all connected,

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:84%
not just with other human beings
but with all sentient life

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universe and
with everything in our world,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:90%
all other animals.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.370 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
that consciousness

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and we're all manifestations
of that consciousness.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Humans are not the
pinnacle of anything,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.967 align:middle line:84%
as much as we try to put
ourselves up on that pedestal.

00:24:51.967 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I've found that the only thing
that humans do that makes

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:90%
them special is they cook.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's not about the
language, it's really not.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Our language actually
is an impediment.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Kind of the rational
mind, the voice

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:84%
in the head so
tightly tied to ego

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:84%
gets in the way of this kind
of journey and understanding.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:10%
But through deep
meditation, releasing

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:10%
those false boundaries
of self and the ego

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:10%
and all of its little
fears and concerns

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:10%
we can actually come
to much greater wisdom.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's find out what
some of you have

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.115 align:middle line:90%
to say about consciousness.

00:25:21.115 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Consciousness it is
a daily question, right?

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.287 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:25:29.287 --> 00:25:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: I kind of think
collective consciousness,

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.840 align:middle line:84%
like raising awareness and
everybody kind of becoming

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:90%
more attuned to one another.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: Being able to talk
with and experience life

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:84%
with other people
knowing that you're awake

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and having thoughts and
feelings that are different

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:90%
from other people.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.178 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Joseph
Campbell describes it

00:25:46.178 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
as being like a leaf
turning towards the sun,

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.119 align:middle line:90%
and I think that's an apt way.

00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:51.660 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
consciousness is.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: We all have heavy
dreams that seem real,

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:84%
so who's to say that's
different than this life

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:90%
that we're living every day?

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:06.167 align:middle line:84%
It's something I
question all the time.

00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was fascinating
watching people like that.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.037 align:middle line:84%
But we get people that
right, they write in to you

00:26:11.037 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:90%
at info@ebenalexander.com.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:10%
I want to read a couple
of them to you, Eben,

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:10%
and have you answer them for us.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.390 align:middle line:10%
Jane from Nashville, Tennessee.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.590 align:middle line:84%
She said, Eben,
I read your book,

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:90%
which is way above my thinking.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:84%
In your book about
heaven, if you were there

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:84%
you didn't mention Jesus
or saints or disciples.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Would you be so
kind as to tell me

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:84%
what church you
attend and do you

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:90%
believe in having communion?

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I grew
up in a Methodist church

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and what I would
say is my journey

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:50.112 align:middle line:84%
showed me very clearly that
God that I met on my journey

00:26:50.112 --> 00:26:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and have come to know so
much more through meditation

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and centering prayer,
that God loves all.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:84%
That God loves Christians, Jews,
Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:90%
atheists, skeptics, bloggers.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:90%
That God loves all of creation.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.925 align:middle line:84%
And one of the worst
problems we've had,

00:27:08.925 --> 00:27:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I came to see that all the
deep mystical traditions of all

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:84%
the great faiths-- whether
it's Buddhism, Judaism,

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Christian mysticism, Sufism,
Islam mysticism, what

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:23.510 align:middle line:84%
have you-- they all converge
on one knowing and one reality.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
It's only when we get the
dogma that emerges out

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
of the teachings for
the masses that come out

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.360 align:middle line:84%
of the various religious systems
that we start to run into all

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:90%
of this incredible conflict.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And this sense of
oh, I'm right, you're

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:90%
wrong is completely wrong.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.190 align:middle line:84%
The deeper traditions
that bypass

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:84%
the Tower of Babel
approach of our dialogue

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and of our teachings is
what gets in the way.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
This is why I encourage
people to go within.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Go within because the
deepest truth lies within

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and there is great truth to
all of those great faiths.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about
the oneness and how

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%
we are all part of one
consciousness that's

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:90%
important to get.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And any kind of
preaching of separatism

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.890 align:middle line:84%
is really getting away
from the original messages

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:90%
of the prophets.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, I would say that I
encourage all of these faiths

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
as long as they are
about the oneness

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and of compassion
and of forgiveness

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and of the reality of that
spiritual essence that

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:90%
is part of all of us.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Peter from St. Louis
writes, Dr. Alexander, I

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:90%
immensely enjoyed your books.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Very much raised my spirits.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering, though,
regarding Christian beliefs,

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:84%
your NDE seems to
not indicate any

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of what might typically
find with the afterlife

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.710 align:middle line:90%
as described in the Bible.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Has that changed your views
or beliefs in Christianity?

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:90%
So another--

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:46.816 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: I think it has.

00:28:46.816 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, what
I would say about

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that-- my amnesia,
as I mentioned,

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:90%
was a very important feature.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first
came back to this world,

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I had none of the
another language, none

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.770 align:middle line:84%
of the preconceptions, none
of the religious concepts

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:90%
to put it together.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And all of that came back
over about eight weeks,

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
but during that time
I was struggling

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.560 align:middle line:90%
to record my experience.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And so to me that
was a real gold mine,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:90%
the fact that I was amnesic.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.270 align:middle line:10%
I had an empty slate so
I could go to that realm,

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:10%
have this experience, come back
without any of the baggage that

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.430 align:middle line:10%
may souls do have.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or bias.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Or bias.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And I think that was important.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It also is important to
point out that everything

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
that I have come
to know and learn

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.110 align:middle line:84%
about this in all of my reading
and all of my meditation

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:84%
is that, as I said, all of the
great faiths at their origin

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.120 align:middle line:90%
are the same.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, what I came to see
is the original Christianity

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that was taught by Christ, which
is not necessarily what's there

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.770 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible because people need
to remember that the Bible was

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.680 align:middle line:84%
actually constructed
by committees

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:84%
several centuries later
and they intentionally

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:90%
omitted several writings.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And for me, learning more
about the gnostic gospels,

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:84%
about the Dead Sea
Scrolls has been

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.220 align:middle line:84%
very important to
formulate what I

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.130 align:middle line:84%
view as a much more
complete version

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:08.470 align:middle line:90%
of the original Christianity.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So I don't necessarily
take the version

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that came out of the
patriarchal committees and kind

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Romans realizing that
Christianity was here to stay.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that their
viewpoint is quite as

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.600 align:middle line:84%
valid as a more global
viewpoint of early Christianity

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and the actual
teachings of Christ

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.986 align:middle line:84%
that I think come through some
of the other writings that

00:30:29.986 --> 00:30:31.610 align:middle line:84%
were not included in
the New Testament.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, I would say
teachings of Buddha, Mohammad.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I see great overlap in
the love and compassion.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.950 align:middle line:84%
That's what really is
the deep message here,

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:42.230 align:middle line:84%
but that message was
hijacked by others

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.000 align:middle line:84%
who tried to twist it
into some of the systems

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.834 align:middle line:90%
of the modern world.

00:30:45.834 --> 00:30:46.633 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:30:46.633 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to our final
e-mail here, Eben, for you.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.240 align:middle line:90%
It's Bob from New York.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Alexander, within a day
I finished reading your book.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.460 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty good, by the way.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It has really
brought some clarity

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.070 align:middle line:84%
to many of the
questions and helped

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.090 align:middle line:84%
me regain some goodness
and wholeness in my life.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:84%
What do you believe
becomes of the evil people

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.860 align:middle line:84%
that we see more of
ever today in our world?

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.660 align:middle line:90%
What about them?

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I would say
they have a hellacious life

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.220 align:middle line:90%
review to go through.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And one should not
minimize that at all.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.855 align:middle line:84%
And as I often say, you
don't need an eternal hell,

00:31:19.855 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
but a life review where
you have to make amends

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:84%
for all the wrongs that you've
done not just in your actions,

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:30.740 align:middle line:84%
but even in your thoughts is
the kind of corrective measure

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that replaces that notion of
eternal hell and damnation.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.480 align:middle line:84%
To me that made zero sense when
I came back from my journey.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, I already could
see that reincarnation was

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:90%
such a crucial part of this.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But I can also see that this
is a very just universe.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:51.505 align:middle line:84%
We reap what we sow and
that's a very crucial lesson.

00:31:51.505 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%
In the Eastern
spiritual traditions,

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:90%
they talk about karma.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And I came away from my journey
seeing very clearly that you're

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:84%
going to end up learning
these lessons of love one

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:04.040 align:middle line:90%
way or the other.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We might as well do it by
manifesting as much love

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
as we can in this
life, loving ourselves

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.750 align:middle line:84%
because first and
foremost that's

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say the origin of so
many of the world's problems

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
is we don't even love
ourselves enough.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do that
before we can really

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
love others and serve as
a conduit of that love

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.716 align:middle line:84%
of the creator for the creation,
bring that love through us.

00:32:26.716 --> 00:32:28.590 align:middle line:10%
But that's what we're
here to do and the more

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.370 align:middle line:10%
we can follow that in
this life, the better we

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.690 align:middle line:10%
will do in that life review.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my life partner
in this, Karen Newell,

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.030 align:middle line:84%
often talks about
doing a daily review

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.540 align:middle line:84%
just to keep the baggage
of her life review

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:84%
as kind of uncumbersome
as possible.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.470 align:middle line:90%
So live this every day.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:84%
That's why these lessons
are so important.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.730 align:middle line:84%
They're not just about
what happens when you die.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.960 align:middle line:84%
This is about how
to live this life

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and it only comes from a
much richer understanding

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
beings that we are

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and that this is a
spiritual universe.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this is all about.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you want to write
in email to Dr. Alexander,

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:84%
it's info@ebenalexander.com
What do

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:84%
you say to people who don't
believe in life after death?

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: I say this
is really tough luck.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.365 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is all a
question of free will.

00:33:24.365 --> 00:33:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And what God gives us
is a beautiful gift,

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.700 align:middle line:90%
is free will to make the choice.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're supposed
to be doing this

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and we're supposed
to be doubting.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:84%
To me, the greatest
asset in this journey

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:90%
is a true open-minded skeptic.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that what my
coma journey did to me early on

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:49.650 align:middle line:84%
was made me a very
open-minded skeptic.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:90%
I had to doubt everything.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Just as Descartes said, if
you want to be a true seeker,

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:84%
you have to at some
point in your life

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:01.040 align:middle line:84%
doubt everything you've
ever thought was real

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and start over
with an open mind.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And I often would say
early on, I'll believe it

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:84%
all for now, just
for the time being,

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:90%
because I want to try it on.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:90%
You have to try these things on.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:15.929 align:middle line:84%
Our culture is so good
at kind of hammering home

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.530 align:middle line:84%
these kind of ideas
of materialism

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that we can lose
sight of it all.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But, indeed, the answers
do lie within us all.

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
So I urge people to go within,
do that practice of meditation.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And as sentient beings, we all
have a very legitimate claim

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:90%
to that realm.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.659 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that
souls can get stuck.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:84%
If they have too
much doubt about it

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:41.320 align:middle line:84%
they can get stuck at that kind
of life review phase, stuck

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.590 align:middle line:84%
down in those murky realms
of that earthworm-eye view

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and never really be able
to ascend because this

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.290 align:middle line:84%
is all part of our learning
and teaching these lessons

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and coming deeper
and closer to truth.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.449 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
truth, but it has

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:84%
to do with our waking up
and facing that truth.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you want to go
through this experience again,

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.800 align:middle line:84%
or would you rather just wait
until the real time comes?

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, I
believe that our lives are

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:13.370 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful blend of kind of a
divine plan that has everything

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:16.260 align:middle line:84%
to do with our
picking before we come

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:84%
into these incarnations
our higher souls

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and soul mates in the soul
group choose the hardships.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
The tough things in life
are gifts-- illness, injury.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Before my coma, of course,
I looked at all that is bad.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Why do these bad things happen?

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fact, look
at them as gifts

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:84%
because that is what provides
the engine for the growth

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.370 align:middle line:90%
of our soul and the ascendance.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.580 align:middle line:84%
It's how we face
the hardships, how

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.160 align:middle line:84%
we face those injuries
and illnesses and all

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.730 align:middle line:90%
the other challenges in life.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And if we can make choices
that manifest that love

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and that compassion,
forgiveness, love

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves and
for others, that's

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.760 align:middle line:84%
what allows us to learn the
lessons of the hardships

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and to ascend beyond them and to
realize that every step of this

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is about soul school, being
here to learn and teach

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.000 align:middle line:90%
these beautiful lessons.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And right now, the main
lesson for humanity to learn

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.440 align:middle line:84%
is that lesson of
unconditional love.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are you
scared of dying, Eben?

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.130 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: Not a bit.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not the end.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.435 align:middle line:90%
It's actually an awakening.

00:36:18.435 --> 00:36:20.395 align:middle line:84%
But I have plenty to
do in this incarnation.

00:36:20.395 --> 00:36:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, there's no rush.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: We get
things done here.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.730 align:middle line:90%
We're here for a reason.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:28.110 align:middle line:84%
As much as I often point out
that the material world is

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:31.960 align:middle line:84%
the illusion, what's
concrete rock solid real

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:90%
is soul, spirit, consciousness.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:84%
That's real and we're here
to learn these lessons.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all of it is set
up in this beautiful fashion,

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.900 align:middle line:84%
for us to come to
realize that and realize

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.510 align:middle line:84%
that the brain,
as I said earlier,

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.870 align:middle line:90%
is a reducing valve or filter.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a prison that our
true awareness comes

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:84%
from going to the
other side of that veil

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and we can do that
in meditation,

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:84%
make it a daily practice,
centering prayer,

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:84%
bring that love for yourself
in and that love for others.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Come to see the beauty
in the hardships, which

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.410 align:middle line:84%
you can do in deep
meditation, and find

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:10.910 align:middle line:84%
that there is great guidance
and wisdom and comfort

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and love deep in meditation
and centering prayer.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has this
experience affected you

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to the point where it was
very emotional for you

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:90%
when you come out of it?

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.440 align:middle line:10%
Because I would
think after you go

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.490 align:middle line:10%
through an experience
like this, not only is it

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.570 align:middle line:10%
an awakening, as
you've gone through,

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:37.280 align:middle line:10%
but that it really tells you
something about the universe.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you're part of
that, when you understand it,

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:45.322 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be a feeling that
it's almost indescribable.

00:37:45.322 --> 00:37:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, it is a
beautiful feeling, indeed.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I think the important
thing to point out

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.690 align:middle line:84%
is the tremendous
amount of confusion

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:56.310 align:middle line:84%
in our kind of conceptualization
of the nature of reality

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
our place in it

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:01.590 align:middle line:84%
has to do with those
false boundaries of self.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And it really involves
moving beyond that.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why souls who
are very advanced, who

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.100 align:middle line:84%
are far along in this
incarnation process

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.990 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who have
completely been liberated

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.660 align:middle line:84%
from that notion of
self and kind of the ego

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and all of the fear and anxiety
that's built around that.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And the more we're
here to serve others

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and to bring that
love in, the better

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.230 align:middle line:84%
it serves us to kind
of have a deeper

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.150 align:middle line:90%
sense of this whole universe.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Because anytime we feel
ourselves as separate from it,

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.540 align:middle line:84%
we're obviously under
this great delusion

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of our modern culture, which
tries to separate out self.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, by getting rid of
those false boundaries of self,

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.300 align:middle line:84%
that's when we start to
realize that one mind

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and that one consciousness
makes far more sense.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
we can certainly

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.230 align:middle line:90%
get to deep in meditation.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a great movie
called "What Dreams May Come"

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:01.280 align:middle line:84%
with the late Robin Williams,
and gosh I miss him,

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:84%
it really showed a different
glimpse of what is out there.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:12.350 align:middle line:84%
When you look back at
what happened to you,

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.760 align:middle line:84%
is it something you expected
or is it different than what

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:17.560 align:middle line:90%
you expected?

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Very different.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:22.370 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very different.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:25.710 align:middle line:84%
The alter reality of
that realm is stunning.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:90%
And you often hear about it.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me, well,
was it like high def TV?

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.050 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.790 align:middle line:90%
This is so much more than that.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And the thing to
realize is by getting

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.510 align:middle line:84%
into that infinite
universal consciousness,

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.760 align:middle line:84%
by transcending that veiling
function in the neocortex

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and the shackles of
the physical brain,

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.320 align:middle line:84%
we're getting into that
wide open territory.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.510 align:middle line:84%
People, for example, who have
taken psychedelic drugs have

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.920 align:middle line:84%
a teeny glimpse of it because
what psychedelic drugs do

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.300 align:middle line:84%
is they remove some of
that filtering mechanism

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and they allow a full onslaught
of sensory information,

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:01.530 align:middle line:90%
but not full.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe too full.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Yes.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
though, they also

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.980 align:middle line:84%
allow us to get in touch with
that universal consciousness

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.180 align:middle line:84%
where you're actually lifted up
out of the illusion of the here

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and now, of that false
sense of locality

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that we have in these
physical bodies.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the
information is flowing at us

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.430 align:middle line:84%
in tremendous
fashion, plus we're

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.420 align:middle line:84%
becoming not only other beings
but other groups of beings,

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:84%
other segments of the universe
as part of the lessons being

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.330 align:middle line:90%
shown to us.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's no wonder that our
Earthly language, which

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.080 align:middle line:84%
of course is very good for
describing a trip to Disney

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.160 align:middle line:84%
World, is not quite
so well suited

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.650 align:middle line:84%
to describing these kind
of spiritual journeys.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:44.400 align:middle line:84%
That's, again, why I
encourage people to go within.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.260 align:middle line:90%
The answers lie within us all.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.760 align:middle line:84%
But so much of it cannot
really be put into our Earthly

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.560 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So doctor, how
is reincarnation possible?

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well,
reincarnation completely

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:84%
defies the materialist thinking
that I had before my coma,

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.580 align:middle line:84%
brain creates consciousness,
birth to death nothing more,

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:84%
which is what I
believed before coma.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
you have to do is

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:11.310 align:middle line:84%
gain a much grander view of
what consciousness actually is.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And there are scientific
groups around the world who are

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.330 align:middle line:90%
doing some amazing work here.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But it really has to do
with this whole mind-body

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:21.170 align:middle line:90%
discussion.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.867 align:middle line:84%
The mind-body debate has been
going on for 2,300 years.

00:41:23.867 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:84%
You'd think we'd be getting
close to some answers.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe we
finally are but it's

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:31.210 align:middle line:84%
through a consolidation of the
greatest wisdom out of Eastern

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.417 align:middle line:84%
and Western spiritual
traditions and the leading edges

00:41:34.417 --> 00:41:35.500 align:middle line:90%
of science and technology.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It has everything to do with
consciousness and what it is.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you come to
realize that consciousness

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:84%
is what creates all this
universe and not the other way

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.940 align:middle line:84%
around, then it starts
to make more sense.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And for me it was crucial
to see in my journey

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I came back and knew
that reincarnation

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.520 align:middle line:84%
was the way it all
worked, but I didn't

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.940 align:middle line:84%
know how to incorporate that
into my scientific worldview.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.140 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that a lot
of the scientific homework

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.810 align:middle line:90%
has been done.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
groups is the group

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.320 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Virginia,
the Vision and Perceptual

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Studies; the work
of Ian Stevenson

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and now with Jim Tucker, where
they have more than 2,500 cases

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
of past life
memories in children

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.270 align:middle line:84%
where the best explanation
is of true reincarnation.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turns out it also
answers many other problems.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.810 align:middle line:84%
For me, that infinitely loving
powerful and knowing God

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.280 align:middle line:84%
was hard to reconcile
with all the evils

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.840 align:middle line:84%
in the world, especially
the suffering of innocents

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.010 align:middle line:90%
like children and animals.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And reincarnation offered a
very obvious solution to that

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and allowed me to fully see the
power of that infinitely loving

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.660 align:middle line:84%
God, but also with
all the suffering

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.310 align:middle line:84%
we see where, by no
fault of their own,

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:52.140 align:middle line:84%
these poor beings are kind of
snuffed out before their time.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And reincarnation is a
great way to see that.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Also important to point out
from the viewpoint of suicide.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Some people think, oh,
well my life is miserable,

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to the
other side, Dr. Alexander

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.810 align:middle line:90%
says it's so beautiful.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem
is suicide leads

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.680 align:middle line:84%
to one of the most profound
life reviews you can imagine,

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.560 align:middle line:84%
where you come to realize the
absolute depth of love that

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:84%
is there for the one
who committed suicide.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.820 align:middle line:10%
And that lesson is
very strong and just is

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.950 align:middle line:10%
shock waves throughout the soul
group involved in that suicide.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:30.620 align:middle line:10%
But it's all to help
move to the next level.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But realize that
it's never the end.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You don't sit up there on a
cloud playing a harp forever.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.070 align:middle line:84%
We come back in and get
it right the next time.

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And again.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:39.100 align:middle line:10%
>>ALEXANDER: And
again and again.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.090 align:middle line:10%
In that pathway of ascendance.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sacred
acoustics, what is that

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and how does that get involved
in the scheme of things here?

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, about
two years after my coma,

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the only way
to start making sense of this

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:58.270 align:middle line:84%
was to go within, to meditate,
to go into my own consciousness

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and try and get a better
idea of the landscape.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Around that time I encountered
the notion of binaural beats

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and brain entrainment using
differential sound frequencies.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me this
is very appealing

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.120 align:middle line:84%
because the general
notion as I understood

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.260 align:middle line:84%
it is that by putting
slightly different frequencies

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.700 align:middle line:84%
into the two ears,
what you end up doing

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:24.820 align:middle line:84%
is kind of hijacking a nucleus
in the lower brain stem.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And I won't go into all the
neuro anatomy and physiology

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:84%
right now, but it has
to do with driving

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:34.550 align:middle line:84%
the predominant electrical
rhythm in the neocortex,

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.780 align:middle line:84%
in the information
processing part of the brain.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And what I've found is that by
using those differential sound

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:45.260 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, you can actually
drive a predominant modulation

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.510 align:middle line:90%
of the neocortex.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, I
could mimic what

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:52.050 align:middle line:84%
had happened with my
near-death experience, where

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:57.240 align:middle line:84%
my neocortex had been destroyed
by E. coli meningitis.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.110 align:middle line:84%
But I could do it temporarily
in a reversible fashion

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.610 align:middle line:84%
by basically monotonizing
the electrochemical activity

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:04.410 align:middle line:90%
in the neocortex.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
stimulated yourself.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: But to a
point where you're actually

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.250 align:middle line:84%
taking the information
processed in the neocortex out

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.990 align:middle line:84%
of the loop and allowing
your conscious awareness

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.820 align:middle line:90%
to take off.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So these differential sound
frequencies are very powerful.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Binaural beats was a
phenomenon first discovered

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.780 align:middle line:84%
in the middle 1800s by
a German physiologist.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.230 align:middle line:84%
People have been using
them in increasing fashion.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I ran into Kevin
Kossi and Karen Newell-- Karen

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Newell, as I've said,
my spiritual partner

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:84%
in all this work-- and they were
making their own binaural beats

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and doing an extremely
good job of it.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Kevin Kossi is a master at this.

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And I encouraged them
to form a company

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and to do this, bring
these tools to the world,

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:47.920 align:middle line:90%
which is what they are doing.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I encourage
people to go there,

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:51.197 align:middle line:90%
try that out.

00:45:51.197 --> 00:45:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Go to sacredacoustics.com.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.720 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely powerful.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't claim that
we really understand

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:57.930 align:middle line:90%
the mechanisms right now.

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:00.590 align:middle line:84%
It's all very early
in the understanding.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But I've been able to
do something and go back

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.940 align:middle line:84%
into my near-death experience
not only to recall memories,

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.400 align:middle line:84%
but to actively work with those
beings and guides, deities.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.790 align:middle line:84%
All of that incredible
power of that realm

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:15.360 align:middle line:84%
is something I can access
through these binaural beats

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.190 align:middle line:90%
and others can do that, too.

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's take a
listen at secret acoustics

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.732 align:middle line:90%
and exactly what it means.

some kind of a meditation

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:57.780 align:middle line:90%
feel to it, doesn't it?

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: Oh, it does.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It puts you
in a different state.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.854 align:middle line:90%
>>ALEXANDER: It does.

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend people
listen through headphones,

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.030 align:middle line:90%
that has even more power.

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:11.250 align:middle line:10%
But I mean just hearing that
little bit through speakers

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:15.670 align:middle line:10%
to me it just obviously drives
something in my own conscious

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.450 align:middle line:10%
whereas you start to
shape your whole mind

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:21.120 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness with this
and it's very, very powerful.

>>NOORY: Eben, it's
always enlightening

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:24.950 align:middle line:84%
to talk with you
about your experience

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:27.580 align:middle line:90%
and I'm glad you're here.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's no rush to
get to the other side,

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.410 align:middle line:84%
but at least when you do
you've kind of given us

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:35.336 align:middle line:84%
a little hint on what we
can expect, so thank you.

00:47:35.336 --> 00:47:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: Well, thank
you so much for having me.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It's always a joy
to be with you, too.

And as we've talked about,
there's no rush to get there

I think you'll be prepared.
