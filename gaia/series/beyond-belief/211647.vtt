>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.010 align:middle line:10%
Debra Martin with us,
an intuitive healer,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:10%
internationally certified
lab research medium,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:10%
and has developed a very
unique distant healing

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:10%
technique that produced
some miraculous results.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.703 align:middle line:90%
Debra, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:34.745 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBRA MARTIN: Oh, thank
you for having me here.

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You look great.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh, thanks.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:90%
You do, too.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are you doing?

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm just living
life and trying to bring joy

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:90%
into my life as much as I can.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
become an intuitive healer?

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:10%
So I had a near-death
experience on 1/21/12.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:10%
And when I crossed over, I
was given the gift of healing.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about the
after-death, near-death

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.478 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I was sick and dying.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:10%
I was being seen by Mayo
clinic and they could not

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:10%
find anything that
was going on with me.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They didn't know
why this was happening?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: They had no clue.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you were dying.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I was
down to 90 pounds.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't eat.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: If I did drink
any water or eat anything,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I was in extreme pain.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were in
pain drinking water?

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Just tiny sips.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:90%
It was like I was in labor.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
get to that point,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.277 align:middle line:90%
you are asking God to take you.

00:01:30.277 --> 00:01:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Like this isn't the quality
of life that I wanted.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wanted to
end-- without ending it,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.275 align:middle line:90%
you wanted it to end.

00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:36.858 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, and
that's hard to say

00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:90%
when you have four children.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right?

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And it was like--

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
but you're not
thinking that way.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:84%
You're just like,
this isn't a quality--

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to be around
for them to see that either.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:90%
So I was praying, just take me.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
the morning that I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
saw physical spiritual
surgeons come into my room.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.747 align:middle line:84%
And being a medium
already, I wasn't afraid.

00:01:57.747 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, what
are you here for?

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then you were
ready, weren't you?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, but when I
saw the spiritual surgeons,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what are
they going to do?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And they started
working on my gut.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:90%
And it was very, very painful.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
going, if I'm going

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
to continue letting
them working on me,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to need to take
like connect out of my body

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:90%
because this is too painful.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So I remember
taking a deep breath

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and when I took a deep breath,
I was now out of my body

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
but I was transcending
and I was going--

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I came to a beautiful
space that was all white.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You left
that area totally?

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Totally.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
in this other space,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I kind of looked around
like, OK, I'm by myself.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:90%
It's all white.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw this vision
of what my God looked

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:90%
like come forward for me.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And now, I saw him
holding my body.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So I knew my soul was watching
this whole production,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.250 align:middle line:90%
I want to say.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And he took my body and he
placed it on a beam of light.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And then he took me to
have a conversation.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you look
unconscious looking

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:90%
at your body?

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, it
just looks still.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like it was dead?

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.580 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, that I'm
just being placed there

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.598 align:middle line:10%
and there was a
coffin next to it.

00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know if I was going
to end up being in the coffin

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
or if we were going to
make a decision here.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
what you asked for.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: This is
what I asked for,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and so when I talked to God and
had a conversation, he said,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
you're on borrowed time
but I can reverse this.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And you'll go back
with a new gift.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
At that time I didn't
know what the gift was.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it meant voice of
being a medium because he said,

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:90%
you'll be a voice.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:84%
What I learned now, I am
the voice of hearing spirit.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
When I do healings,
I'm able to tell people

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:90%
what's going on with them.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So it-- when it
came back into the body,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:90%
something shifted.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No more pain, nothing?

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.088 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No more pain.

00:03:57.088 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had pain for a while,
I still had to walk through it

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's interesting
with my healings, too.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
It can happen instantly
and it can take time.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I stood in my faith
going, OK, I came back.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason I'm back.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be
sick for a long time.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And then my healing
abilities just boomed.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't you glad you
didn't jump off too soon?

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I am glad I
didn't jump off too soon.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is an
international research lab

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:90%
certified medium?

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So
certified medium means

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
that I was tested with a
quadruple blood experiment

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Gary Schwartz
and Dr. Julie Beischel.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to learn
more about that experiment,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.965 align:middle line:84%
you can go on to the
Windbridge Institute

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and they'll tell you the whole
protocol what I had to do.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.215 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love Gary.

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:90%
He's a great guy.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.988 align:middle line:90%
It was not an easy test.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been
healing and working this now

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:90%
for how many years?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So my mediumship,
I've done over 20 years.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And my healing abilities have
been on 1/21/12, so about 12,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:90%
a little over 12 years.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're doing
long distance healing?

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I am doing
long distance healing.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I find that doing
a remote healing

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
is more profound than
doing a in-person session.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:90%
The healing is like energy.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Energy travels, and so instantly
when I connect with my client,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:84%
they're already feeling no
matter where they're at,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:84%
they're feeling what's
happening in my room.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They feel it instantly?

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, some people might not--

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.312 align:middle line:84%
I should say some people
won't feel things,

00:05:31.312 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:84%
some people will feel if the
spiritual surgeons give them

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
medicine, they might
sleep the whole time,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:90%
and go I just couldn't move.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Some people will,
like this one woman,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I saw her daughter who was
deceased come into the room

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:90%
and I could see her vividly.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And then she saw her on her end.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She saw her?

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: And then--

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She saw
her dead daughter?

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, and she heard
words from her and she helped--

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:90%
and she felt her hold her hand.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes I
see spiritual surgeons

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:90%
like I see them all the time.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're hilarious because
they might drop something

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:84%
in my room like a tool
that they're using on me

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:90%
and you'll hear it.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:90%
And I used to get mad like--

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and I could see them in
my mind, and I'm like,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, you guys are disrupting me.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go,
sorry, like that.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'll go, OK, this is funny.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Killing
your concentration.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.203 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right, was like, stop.

00:06:22.203 --> 00:06:27.623 align:middle line:84%
But what's so fascinating with
that is now when it happens,

00:06:27.623 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I know it's happening
for a reason

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:90%
because everything is recorded.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So when I say, oh they
dropped something,

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:84%
the person who's
having the healing

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.182 align:middle line:90%
can hear it and go I heard it.

00:06:37.182 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
the Truman Show.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a
technique called God is love.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So I believe
that God is love.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I call my healing
God is love healings

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:90%
because I believe love heals.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And so in my healings,
the process of my healing

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:84%
is I will go into
a healing session

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:90%
and I will begin with prayer.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
After my prayer,
then I will start

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
connecting and I'm on a
healing table and I vision

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.007 align:middle line:84%
a beam of light coming down
going into my solar plexus--

00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into yours?

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.528 align:middle line:84%
So every client has to
send me their picture.

00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a full body picture.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.903 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to become their proxy.

00:07:19.903 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And I place that right
here on my abdomen.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And the beam of light connects
the three of us as one.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.888 align:middle line:84%
So the energy and the frequency
is touching all three of us.

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is
long distance healing?

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: This is.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So I can see what's
going on in the body.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.697 align:middle line:84%
I can hear what's
going on in the body.

00:07:35.697 --> 00:07:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, I can hear the words
that they need to hear.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I can see the
spiritual surgeons.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I can see if we go on
out of body experience.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I can see God come
into the room.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:90%
I can see loved ones.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So the mediumship
really plays a big role

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:84%
because I'm able to see, hear,
and voice everything that's

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:90%
And then I also feel--

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:90%
my body will feel.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And people get so
upset, like, oh, I'm

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:84%
so sorry that you had
to take out my pain.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's not something to
be sorry about because it

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:90%
becomes a blessing.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I can feel it, so
I don't deny it.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
That, oh, my gosh, they're
working in the knee,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:90%
I can feel the knee pain.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Or, oh, you're
wearing a kidney bag.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.163 align:middle line:90%
I can see it and feel it.

00:08:19.163 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You get the
pain from the individual?

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So that we can go
and release it.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.973 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
excruciating sometimes?

00:08:24.973 --> 00:08:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Sometimes.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
if you take in the pain,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:90%
and you can't get rid of it?

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Never had that.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.649 align:middle line:84%
So when you go in
with the intention of,

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
thank you for allowing
me to feel it,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
but when the session is over,
it's no longer a part of me.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:90%
That's your truth.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
an intuitive healer

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.153 align:middle line:90%
more than you're a medium?

00:08:45.153 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I would say
I'm an intuitive healer,

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
but I do bring
the mediumship in.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I just did a session
for a family of five.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And they want to connect
with their deceased father.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:90%
And he had committed suicide.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, gosh.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And so the kids
were all in their teen ages.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And the mother was
like, they need healing,

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:90%
and now they're grown up.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.200 align:middle line:84%
The father came through and
talked to each individual one

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:90%
by one.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through you?

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where the
mediumship was there.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And gave them direct
messages of what they're

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:90%
doing in life, how he feels.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And then he talked to
the wife, and what's--

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I was just
dumbfounded with this.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
She said the words he spoke
to her that day were verbatim

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
the words that he wrote
on his suicide letter.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right?

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's incredible.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Was there a lot of
forgiveness there

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:90%
on the behalf of the kids?

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, they
were able to understand.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
pain involved too.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So that wasn't
really a physical healing.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:90%
That was an emotional healing.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
just as important.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It is.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the boys
was kind of suicidal.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And within a couple
of weeks, he ended up

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:84%
turning his whole life
around, just from the words

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:90%
that his father gave.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about some
of your most recent miraculous

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.260 align:middle line:90%
healing in a case.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'm excited
to share this.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:84%
My most recent
miraculous healing

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:90%
was for a little boy, aged six.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:90%
His name is Theo.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:90%
He's from London.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was cured of
terminal leukemia.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.010 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.442 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
looking emotional.

00:10:28.442 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I do get emotional.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll get emotional
through the whole thing.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go ahead, cry.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: [LAUGHS] So you're
going to be just so surprised

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
On the day that Theo's
parents, Michael and Katie,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
received the news of
Theo's bone marrow biopsy,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:90%
he only had two weeks to live.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, God.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It was the very
same day that your episode

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:84%
with me aired on Gaia
with Mary and Willa.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And the mother said,
I have a knowingness

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:90%
that this needs to be done.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And because of your show,
that's why they want

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:90%
me to speak this story today.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:90%
You saved their son.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.857 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So did you.

00:11:20.857 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It takes a team.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You got me emotional.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.333 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I'm sorry.

00:11:29.333 --> 00:11:37.177 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.177 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We sometimes
don't understand

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:90%
the power of what we do.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:90%
What did the doctors say?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So the
doctors sent Theo home,

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and told him that he
had two weeks to die.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.652 align:middle line:84%
That's the longest
they gave him.

00:11:53.652 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
when you kicked in.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And so that's
when they reached out to me

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:90%
to have a healing session.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And on the day that we
had the healing session,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
the father realized that
it was one year to the date

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:90%
that he was diagnosed.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So we felt, wow, this
is so divinely planned.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:84%
When I went into the healing
session, I took Theo's picture.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, God, we're
healing leukemia here today.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's in London.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:90%
You're in Phoenix.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: He's in London,
and I'm in Phoenix, correct.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So I take the picture,
and I'm talking to God.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And I say, God, we're
healing leukemia today.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And God says, don't
give power to the name.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
When you give power to
the name of leukemia,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
you're giving power
to the illness.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I was like, OK.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:90%
So I removed my humanness aside.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.015 align:middle line:84%
And I allowed God to take
over, orchestrate the session.

00:12:54.015 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through you?

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Mm-hm.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So I laid down on
the healing table.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, I saw
spiritual surgeons.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
I saw a needle go into
my neck, and a needle

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:90%
go into underneath my right rib.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I saw tubes coming
out of both areas.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
extract the cancer.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I learned later,
after the session,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is these two areas
were the exact areas

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:90%
that Theo had his tubes.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Without knowing that?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Right.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So what happens next
is, God takes Theo

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:90%
into another dimension.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Theo,
I'm so proud of you.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:90%
You are so courageous.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:90%
You're one strong boy.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want you to feel
anything during this session.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to have you--

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
this beautiful golden dog

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:90%
comes and sits next to Theo.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I'm going to
let you go play in the field,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:90%
in the pasture with this dog.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this a real
dog or a mystical dog?

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: A real dog.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.255 align:middle line:90%
Well, in this dimension.

00:13:57.255 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In this dimension.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So they
go off and play.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:90%
So I come back into my body.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And I start feeling
kind of itchy.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And God says, if
he develops a rash,

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:84%
just know that that's everything
still coming out of the body.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, he developed a
rash, and his parents knew why.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in this session right
now, and I'm laying straight.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Theo's picture is here.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And my body starts thrashing.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quivering.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, really violently,
like, shaking.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It goes on for a
long, long time.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:90%
When I complete--

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you alert?

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I'm alert.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: But I have no control.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It's taking over me.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.640 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I
said to myself, OK,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:90%
just let it go, let it happen.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And then when it came to
a stop, I was overwhelmed.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:90%
I was crying.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like my body
just went through a marathon.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:90%
I was breathing heavy.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.310 align:middle line:90%
I had to get back to my center.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Once I was back to
my center, I then

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.240 align:middle line:84%
went back into the
dimension where Theo was.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching, and
God called Theo over.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:90%
So Theo walks up to God.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And the dog follows,
and sits next to Theo.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:90%
So, all of a sudden, Theo goes--

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:90%
shakes his hand.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A paw?

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: And I start--

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.568 align:middle line:90%
no, he's doing this to God.

00:15:33.568 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, he's
shaking God's hand?

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was
shaking the dog's hand.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, the
dog's sitting here.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And he goes up to God, and
starts shaking his hand.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:90%
And I start laughing.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I just think that's
the cutest thing.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And God looks at me, and he
says, no, this is an agreement

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.077 align:middle line:90%
that Theo and I are making.

00:15:49.077 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're cutting a deal.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.743 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They're cutting the
deal, like two men shaking

00:15:52.743 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:90%
hands, making an agreement.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:90%
And so they shared words.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And I could not
hear those words.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Those words were
between Theo and God.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo's
mother, Katie, explains

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:90%
the results of what you did.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The hour that he
was having his healing,

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
we experienced magic and things
that we can't humanly explain.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:10%
And then immediately
following the healing,

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:10%
we saw huge improvements.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And these include
his blood counts

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that had been perpetually low
for months immediately doubled.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:84%
His appetite went through the
roof, and we couldn't fill him.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:84%
His energy went through
the roof to the point

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:84%
that the hospital
couldn't understand

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:90%
how he was bouncing around.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:10%
His vitality increased.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:90%
We had our son back.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.910 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden from a
very, very poorly child,

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:90%
we had Theo back.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
The next bone marrow
biopsy after the healing,

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
which was three weeks, showed
that the leukemia, the disease

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:90%
had stood still.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:90%
It hadn't moved.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors couldn't
comprehend this.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Because this was such
an aggressive disease

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
that in a two-week period on
the strongest chemotherapy

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
you could give a
person, it still

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:84%
found a way to completely
rage through that.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't control it
with that chemotherapy.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Now in a two-month
period, with absolutely

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
no medical intervention,
it had stood still, which

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:90%
is a medical impossibility.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And they had no
explanation for that.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The parents
are obviously in shock

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:90%
that this worked the way it did.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They
are very grateful.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Very, very grateful.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:43.863 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:17:43.863 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:90%
How about the doctors?

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:90%
What did they say?

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:46.448 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: The doctors--

00:17:46.448 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The skeptical doctors.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Perplexed.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But they were calling
it a bit of a miracle.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.280 align:middle line:90%
They won't say--

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
wouldn't go the full--

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.148 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, a
bit of a miracle.

00:17:57.148 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:90%
But we'll take it.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:10%
I will say there was a point
where we weren't happy.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:10%
We were thinking the biopsy
was going to come back

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:10%
where he would show anything.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So when it said stable, here
we were being ungrateful.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:10%
We were just like, what?

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to
have our moment.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:84%
We had to feel that
emotion, like we--

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wanted
it totally gone.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: We want it gone.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:90%
So now what?

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:90%
What's the next step?

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:90%
What do we do next?

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And things leading
up to that, God

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:84%
said, I want you to go
and ask all the why nots.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Why not do these next steps
that we're going to show you?

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Interesting timing how
everything is always divinely

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:90%
planned.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:84%
You saw them wearing the
Army for Love shirts.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:90%
That's a group that I do.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a free once a month Zoom.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about things that
are going on in our life.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: At the
end of the session,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:90%
there is a mini healing.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For everybody
there participating.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:84%
What did Katie tell
you about dying before?

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's what I'm
going to share with you.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So it happened in the
mini healing session.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.263 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not going to
make me cry again, are you?

00:19:15.263 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Probably.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:84%
In the mini healing
session, God took all of us

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:90%
to the edge of a mountain.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And he told us, I want you
to step off the mountain.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I know it's scary.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I know it takes
a lot of courage.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's unknown.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Will you fall?

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Will you die?

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.350 align:middle line:84%
What will happen when you
step off that mountain?

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So we all took
the leap of faith.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:90%
We took our step.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And we were standing in
the middle of the air.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Just standing.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And he says, see?

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:90%
I got you.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.160 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to fall.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:90%
So Katie speaks.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:90%
And she's crying.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I haven't
told anyone this.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I haven't told anybody
this, but my husband.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So God knew that
if he takes my son,

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.845 align:middle line:84%
I told Michael, her
husband, that I'm

00:20:23.845 --> 00:20:25.470 align:middle line:84%
going to climb up
that mountain and I'm

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:84%
going to jump off, because
I'm not going to let my son be

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.078 align:middle line:90%
on the other side without me.

00:20:29.078 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:84%
She would have
committed suicide.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And God knew it and
said, take the leap of faith.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to let you fall.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close was Michael
involved in all of this?

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: He was involved
every step of the way.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:84%
What's so beautiful
is that they're really

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:90%
just a strong team.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:10%
When you're going through
the trenches of this

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:10%
and not knowing what the next
step is, Michael was her rock.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:90%
She was his rock.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And I just come in to try
to assess and bring joy

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:90%
to the situation for every step.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So it was interesting
what happened next, is

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:90%
the doctors made a call.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:84%
The doctors called us
and said to us, well,

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Theo's now at this
level where he

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
wasn't before where
he qualifies to go

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:90%
to Barcelona for a treatment.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:84%
He'd be the first
person in the world

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:90%
to receive this treatment.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to proceed?

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So you take a deep breath
going, well, do we?

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Do we continue?

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:90%
What would that look like?

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:90%
All the unknowns.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
asking all the why nots.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up
going to Barcelona.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As an added benefit, I
assume, to the healing you did.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So you look at how
God presents things,

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and you never know
what it means.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you walk through
every single door,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:90%
it will reveal itself.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So we started asking
all the why nots.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't we do this?

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And everything ended
up being that pointed

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.070 align:middle line:84%
in the right direction
of, we need to do this.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:84%
As scary as it was, we all
held each other's hands,

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:90%
and they drove to Barcelona.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it work.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.553 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, they
didn't have the trial.

00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did not?

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So what
ended up happening was

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:84%
the night before he was
supposed to have the treatment,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:90%
I was on the phone with them.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were nervous
for what they were

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:90%
going to have the next day.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.630 align:middle line:90%
What's the outcome going to be?

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.202 align:middle line:84%
No one knows, not
even the doctors.

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time in the world

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
that somebody's going
to receive this.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So I said, well, I'll stay up.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll stay up.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.252 align:middle line:90%
You guys get some sleep.

00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You still
had his picture.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.127 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I still
had his picture.

00:23:02.127 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Saying some prayers.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So at 2 o'clock in
the morning, my time,

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I get a text that says
that they had an emergency

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:90%
meeting with the doctor.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over Theo?

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Over Theo.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK,
what could be going on?

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Now the night before--

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And everybody thought
he was getting better, right?

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.273 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Everybody thought
he was getting better.

00:23:25.273 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But the night before,
Michael and I were talking.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And we both had this
download from spirit

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that the doctors were
going to be perplexed.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And we had no idea
what that meant.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So now they're headed into
this meeting with the doctors.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said,
we're so sorry.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Theo can no longer
have the treatment.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, why?

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, the protein that he
needed to have in his body

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to have
this treatment--

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Treatment.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --is no
longer visible.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.440 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.540 align:middle line:90%
And we have no explanation.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just gone.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they said all
the scans and everything

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that they did there now showed
that his body was healthy.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:90%
And that there was nothing.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.077 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is great news.

00:24:20.077 --> 00:24:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well that's
what we were thinking.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But the doctors,
I think, were sad

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.395 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
able to do the trial.

00:24:25.395 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they
weren't involved.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Katie the mother
details what went on

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:90%
during that Barcelona trial.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When Theo was in Barcelona,
he had one week of screening

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.650 align:middle line:90%
tests.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And this involved blood
tests which were--

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:84%
they included all
manner of things.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So they took a lot
of blood to test

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.840 align:middle line:90%
for lots of different things.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:84%
He had two ultrasounds,
one on his lymph nodes,

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
one on his heart to
test his heart function.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:59.230 align:middle line:84%
There was another day where
he had a bone marrow biopsy.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the final day
involved a full body PET scan.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:90%
And this was for one hour.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So he needed to be put under
general anesthetic for this.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And they injected him
with radioactive isotopes.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So it was really thorough
to check from head

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:90%
to toe for anything lurking.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Any tumors, anything abnormal.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Because they needed to
test to see how healthy

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:90%
his body was functioning.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So it was a really intense
and difficult week,

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:84%
for which Debra was there
with us every step of the way.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were
the results, then?

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:90%
He was cured.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, they wouldn't
say that he was cured.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:90%
They were all just perplexed.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.980 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.647 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
know what happened.

00:25:47.647 --> 00:25:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So she
calls me, right.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.248 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't know how to feel.

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:52.968 align:middle line:84%
Because the doctors are
like, oh, we're so sorry.

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Instead of being
jumping for joy, right.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So she's like,
and so I hear these words.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
start laughing.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, I
don't mean to be rude.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:90%
But that was just my reaction.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I was laughing, going, you guys,
you know what just happened?

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
We went to Barcelona
because Barcelona

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
did all the tests, all the
screening, all the blood tests,

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
all the CT scan everything
that Katie just said,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't have
had done in London.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.260 align:middle line:90%
It was proof of God's miracle.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And it was like,
do you see how we had to go

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.180 align:middle line:90%
through--

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the doctors
still would not admit it.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So that night, so it's
I go to bed, I wake up.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And I get a vision.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:90%
So I get this vision.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And I go, oh, Katie's not
going to like this vision.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:90%
So I call Katie.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Katie puts me on
the speakerphone.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Now it's the middle
of their day, right.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:90%
So they've had their day.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Katie, I
have to share something.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm apprehensive to
share this, but I

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.960 align:middle line:90%
think you should get a puppy.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.667 align:middle line:90%
She goes, oh my god, Debra.

00:27:00.667 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
With everything I've been going
through, I don't need a puppy.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here's that
dog again, right?

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So what
happens is Theo goes,

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.600 align:middle line:84%
yay, Debra says
we're getting a dog.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's going on?

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:84%
He goes, Michael had the
same vision that morning

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:90%
that we need to get a dog.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.900 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:90%
That night, they found the dog.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a golden dog.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:84%
They were able to bring the
dog home on Theo's birthday.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
that for timing?

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And so we feel
in our hearts, the dog that

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:84%
was in heaven, Theo didn't
have to go to the dog.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
The dog was born
and came to Theo.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.748 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that story.

00:27:44.748 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Isn't that beautiful?

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is Theo's
life expectancy today?

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, he was
given two weeks to live.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:90%
And now it's been seven months.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
in total remission?

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, he's
healthy, he's whole.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:90%
He's living life.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And what I have to
say about that family

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:90%
is they bring joy to their life.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So joy and love
raises the vibration.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.440 align:middle line:84%
They played a major role
in their son's healing.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:90%
They weren't down and depressed.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:84%
When they were, they
removed themselves.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They still felt
that they walked through it.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.040 align:middle line:84%
But then they said,
how's that serving me?

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we danced and we
sang and we brought joy

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:90%
to every single day.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And now they have to learn how
to live in this new reality.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.713 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are people
around Theo today?

00:28:38.713 --> 00:28:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's
interesting, because Theo

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.233 align:middle line:90%
has gone back to the ward.

00:28:42.233 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he gets
blood tests just

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.863 align:middle line:84%
to see how his immune
system's doing.

00:28:45.863 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if he goes
to school, he's

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:84%
got to make sure
everything is full--

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:90%
his immune system's high.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And so he brings
joy and light to that ward.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
is he's bringing hope.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the parents see that he
was once where their child is.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
believed, Debra,

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:11.400 align:middle line:84%
to use traditional medicine with
faith in alternative medicine.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.027 align:middle line:84%
The combination to me
works and works well.

00:29:15.027 --> 00:29:16.110 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I 100% agree.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I think you use every
tool in the toolbox.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.480 align:middle line:90%
The doctors played a major role.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:84%
They saved Theo for
over a year, right?

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a year since we
had the healing session.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.860 align:middle line:90%
They did their part.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But then their role stopped,
and then the healing took over

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.600 align:middle line:90%
and God took over.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was God's
and Theo's plan.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Faith is very important
in the scheme of things,

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: For me,
faith is everything.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Faith is my foundation.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And having faith, it takes every
worry, every concern that I

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:90%
have, I give it over to God.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it's
going to turn out

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:90%
the way it's supposed to.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:90%
So it frees me.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo's parents,
Michael and Katie,

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%
talk about faith and how
it helped their journey.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Standing in faith is
something that you can only

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.750 align:middle line:84%
understand the true meaning
of once you've actually

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.060 align:middle line:84%
experienced it and
lived through it.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Before this journey, I saw
standing in faith as something

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that you did with
complete trust.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:84%
But you weren't
allowed to be human.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:90%
I saw it as an inhuman act.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Because how can
you stand in faith

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.460 align:middle line:84%
when you're going
through the darkest days

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.990 align:middle line:84%
when the medical community
are telling you your son isn't

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:90%
going to survive?

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And you've only got two people
telling you that they're wrong.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And he is, and you spent your
whole life in this community.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's very difficult
to stand in faith.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And one thing Debra's
helped us with

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and especially her
books and the stories

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.840 align:middle line:84%
that people have shared,
such as Mary and Willa,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.450 align:middle line:84%
is that standing in
faith actually is

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.280 align:middle line:90%
about how you can bounce back.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not denying
your human emotions.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not being ignorant to
the pain and the suffering

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.560 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
endure while you're

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:90%
walking this path of faith.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I think for me,
to encapsulate it,

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I would change it rather
than stand in faith

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.020 align:middle line:90%
to become a warrior of faith.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And the way I mean that
is that a warrior fights

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:28.030 align:middle line:90%
no matter the odds.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.030 align:middle line:84%
A warrior will fight no
matter what people are

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.410 align:middle line:90%
telling the consequences are.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:84%
They fight for what
they believe is right.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And for us, it's taken us to
be told that our son isn't

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.330 align:middle line:90%
going to survive.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.330 align:middle line:84%
For us to be told
there is no thing

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that
can survive him.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:48.000 align:middle line:84%
It's taken that for us to
become different people

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.647 align:middle line:84%
and become warriors
of faith in the way we

00:31:51.647 --> 00:31:53.980 align:middle line:84%
will fight against the odds,
we will stand with our son.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And we will walk
the walk of faith.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What Debra's allowed us to
do is feel when we're frightened

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:04.470 align:middle line:90%
and angry and frustrated.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But let it go and come
back to standing in faith.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And living in joy and
living in the present.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that it has
allowed us to do in a way

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that I have never been
able to do in my whole life

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:90%
is presence myself.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.540 align:middle line:90%
And enjoy right now.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:90%
And it stops you missing things.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And it allows you to
see what's really there.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.750 align:middle line:84%
It brings gravity to
where you are right now.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that we
are incredibly grateful to Debra

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Because it's allowed us to be
human and move through this

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:84%
with the courage and the
faith to trust in the words

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.340 align:middle line:84%
we were given, even
when it didn't look

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:90%
like how we thought it would.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Because we had no roadmap.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to
trust in the words

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and keep coming back to that.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And she's been with
us the whole way.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And there are no words for
our gratitude for Debra

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.950 align:middle line:90%
for being there with us.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.780 align:middle line:90%
And for God for healing our son.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they scared at
all during this process, Debra?

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Oh, yes.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They thought
they were going to lose--

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: There were
times where we didn't

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.220 align:middle line:90%
understand what was happening.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared, too?

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I
was honest with them.

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, I was a little
pissed, to be honest with you,

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.270 align:middle line:84%
when the biopsy came back
and it wasn't fully healed.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what the heck, God?

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:90%
You gave us these words.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Either do
it completely or--

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're all like, all
right, let's have our moment.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Right, we're all on the
phone and we're talking.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:84%
We're having this
pity crying moment.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And now we look back and
we laugh and go, well,

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:84%
if we would have known, God,
that you were sending us

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.372 align:middle line:84%
to Barcelona for
these results, then

00:33:46.372 --> 00:33:47.830 align:middle line:84%
we would have seen
the big picture.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have
had a pity party.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So we see the blessings
out of everything now.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
But no, it was not
an easy journey.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key here.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to continue to
walk through every door.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.060 align:middle line:90%
You have to stand in your faith.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Stand in your truth.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.858 align:middle line:90%
Where does your truth come from?

00:34:04.858 --> 00:34:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It comes from your heart.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.600 align:middle line:84%
When Katie and Michael
have a strong knowingness

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.480 align:middle line:84%
in their heart that their
son was not going to die,

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they
stood strong in.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.600 align:middle line:84%
They didn't allow their
brain to spiral them

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.989 align:middle line:90%
to think anything different.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem
very determined

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:84%
in these videos
I've seen of them.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:90%
Very determined.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They're very
confident in what they hear.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:28.190 align:middle line:90%
They have the faith.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:29.270 align:middle line:90%
They trust.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And trust is a big word.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Trusting in the process.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Army for Love, Debra?

00:34:35.195 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: OK, so Army
for Love is a gathering

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.400 align:middle line:84%
that I host on
Zoom once a month.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.330 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's for people that
have any type of illness--

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.530 align:middle line:84%
emotionally,
physically, spiritually.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:84%
That we join together
as a community

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.030 align:middle line:84%
to put love into action,
to hold each other's hands,

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.699 align:middle line:84%
and to guide each other
with love and hope.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And I do a mini healing
session at the end

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:90%
of the session every month.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Earlier, Debra,
you mentioned Willa.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
more about who Willa is.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: OK, so Willa was
on my last episode with you.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the Jones family had

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.840 align:middle line:90%
seen Mary and Willa's story.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I connected the
two families together,

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:84%
because without them
seeing that story,

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:84%
they may never have
known about me.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they met thanks
to you for the very first time.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But after the first
meeting with Debra,

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.303 align:middle line:84%
my perception from the
Gaia episode was that

00:35:31.303 --> 00:35:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Willa's healing was instant.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'd taken from that.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And Debra knows
the disappointment

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I had when we found
out after the healing

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.920 align:middle line:90%
after his aspirate hadn't gone.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And I ordered Debra's work.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And literally the day
after we found out,

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.220 align:middle line:84%
that was the bit I
got to Willa's story

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.280 align:middle line:84%
in the book, "Proof
of Miracles."

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.878 align:middle line:90%
And I read it.

00:35:52.878 --> 00:35:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Katie was cooking dinner.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:90%
I was sat in the kitchen.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like this
huge weight lifted.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, oh
my gosh, Willa's parents

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:84%
had to go through hell from
the healing to all being clear.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And OK, you had the dates,
which was wonderful.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.110 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't instant.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
penny dropped to me.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not instant.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And it takes time.

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:18.160 align:middle line:90%
And I can't explain to you.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where I'd
have been mentally,

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think I'd
have been able to get back

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to standing in faith
without you and your story.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:90%
And I genuinely mean that.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was your
story that spoke to us.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.055 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that you were
talking about with Willa.

00:36:32.055 --> 00:36:33.930 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a completely
different diagnosis.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But all of the details
where they mattered,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.060 align:middle line:90%
they were identical.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.500 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.570 align:middle line:84%
In the critical
care and everything.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.190 align:middle line:10%
And we kept pausing it.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.320 align:middle line:90%
We kept saying, this is for us.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.680 align:middle line:84%
This story is for us
from God, and we knew.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So then when there was
no doubt when we then

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:84%
had the next results
that showed, we said,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.370 align:middle line:90%
we need a miracle.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And we said, well,
I know where to go.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:90%
So we contacted Debra.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it was your
story that spoke to us.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say in truth that
although we were very, very

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:20.980 align:middle line:84%
touched and Debra spoke to us,
it was the combination of Debra

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and your story
specifically that spoke

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to our hearts that made us
know, this is what to do next.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's next
for the family of Theo?

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
Katie's writing a book.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: About the
entire episode?

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.480 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Yes, and it will
tell the entire journey.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.705 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Maybe a movie.

00:37:39.705 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
might be a movie.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Might be a movie.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.925 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's very visual.

00:37:42.925 --> 00:37:48.110 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of visions that
we received along the way.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:54.177 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to be titled
"And Then Hope Appeared."

00:37:54.177 --> 00:37:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debra, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, thank
you for having me.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Healing and
faith really works.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:05.530 align:middle line:10%
Debra has demonstrated it
with the little boy Theo.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're so glad we've
become a part of it.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.710 align:middle line:90%
