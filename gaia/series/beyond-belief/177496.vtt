>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
they say in Missouri,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.560 align:middle line:10%
if you don't like the
weather, wait a minute.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:10%
It'll change.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.580 align:middle line:10%
And our special guest is former
television weather caster,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:10%
Scott Stevens, who has now
changed his pleas of weather,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:10%
because now he
looks at chemtrails,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:10%
strange anomalies,
and things that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:10%
are happening on this planet.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Scott, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT STEVENS: Glad to
be here with you, George.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have done
a great job for us

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:90%
on the radio program.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I get more calls about you
when you're on afterwards

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.897 align:middle line:90%
from people who say, gosh.

00:00:49.897 --> 00:00:50.855 align:middle line:90%
Is it really happening?

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Are these things
really going on?

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.574 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Oh, man, George.

00:00:55.574 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
That's where I was
for a long time.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:10%
It's like, this can't be real.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:10%
This really can't be
happening, but it is.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:10%
It is.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:10%
And that was a real
world view change when

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:10%
I was the regular weather
man, 5:00, 6:00, and 10:00

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:10%
doing the news, thinking I
was forecasting mother nature.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.437 align:middle line:90%
This isn't her game.

00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are
forecasting or trying

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.375 align:middle line:84%
to forecast human
involvement in mother nature.

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: And that's
a big revelation,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:10%
because how can man
outside of this CO2

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:10%
and this global warming
construct impact

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:10%
the weather to that degree?

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:10%
And that was the big mystery.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:10%
How is this possible?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Weather
modification, chemtrails.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to do?

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Oh, I wish
I had that answer.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
If it was truly a one-line or
a one-paragraph or maybe even

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
a one-sheet executive summary,
I would love to read that thing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But I promise you it began
back with the military

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
after World War II when you
had all of those men, all

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
of those assets ready to go
when it was the weather forecast

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.787 align:middle line:90%
go or no go.

00:01:57.787 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like D-Day.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Exactly.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The invasion
may have been canceled

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:90%
because of the weather.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.663 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And when
you have that kind

00:02:05.663 --> 00:02:08.580 align:middle line:84%
of money and those generals
and that kind of pressure

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
ready to go, why
can't we control this?

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
What kind of money would it take
to have a greater insight so

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that the forecast isn't 40%
accurate or 40% certainty,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.614 align:middle line:84%
but we had 85%, 90% certainty
as to go on that particular day?

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what they began

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:90%
working for during the war.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it dangerous
to modify the weather?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Ooh.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we have
the consciousness

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
to understand the multitude
of knock-on effects

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:90%
that will happen.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.912 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a one event
like one stone in the pond

00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and out go the ripples,
you can see them.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:90%
You can differentiate.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this was the
single first cause.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:84%
But when you start
tossing multiple stones

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and sending up multiple
sets of ripples,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
it becomes much more
confusing or complex.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And interesting you
go there, because I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.367 align:middle line:84%
think that's ultimately why
the chemtrails came into being.

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
strange these days,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Scott, too, is records are
being set all the time--

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
the hottest day,
the coldest day.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's confusing.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:90%
But it's violent, isn't it?

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's violent.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And I believe one of the
necessary reasons why this

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is happening and
why you would want

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
to have those kind of events
is to keep it in the news.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:90%
And if you have--

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:84%
what are we, in the coldest
April or coldest beginning

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
of the spring for
Canada and the US

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and other parts of
the planet as well,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:84%
that means that there has
to be a corresponding bubble

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:90%
of warmth.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to displace
the jet stream down

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
over the eastern US, there's got
to be a ridge somewhere else.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And out west, we
know it's simply dry.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:90%
It's been dry.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's always, again,
a result and effect

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.626 align:middle line:84%
from that modification
of the weather.

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've
talked in the past

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
about the so-called
global warming

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and the reasons behind
it and politically

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
who is benefiting
from things like that.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
money involved here.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think it
always comes down to money.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you politicize
science, money

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:90%
is at the heart of that game.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
When you politicize
medicine, it's about money.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
When you politicize energy,
it again comes back to money.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So we can look at the
weather, and rarely is there

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
a part of our
economy that weather

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:90%
doesn't touch every single day.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's pipelines
shooting natural gas

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
on up to the Northeastern
states or eastern Canada,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
whether it's water
usage in California,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the sinking
pool levels in some

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.080 align:middle line:84%
of those big reservoirs
that generate electricity

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
for Arizona and California,
water is crucial.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And also, corn and
sorghum and cattle--

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:90%
water touches everything.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, money does,
and so does weather.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a new
classification of clouds.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.235 align:middle line:84%
They found more clouds,
different kind of clouds.

00:05:08.235 --> 00:05:10.599 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Forget being on cloud nine.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.794 align:middle line:10%
We on cloud 12 because that's
how many new types of clouds

00:05:15.794 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:10%
have been added to this
historic update coming

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.655 align:middle line:10%
from meteorologists.

00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm a little biased, right?

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:10%
Exciting stuff, guys.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.610 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:10%
So the new types include
the volutus, or roll cloud,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:10%
which has been designated
as a whole new species.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
You can see it gets its name
from this long, horizontal

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:90%
tube-like shape.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:10%
Next one up, we have the
cavum, or the hole punch cloud.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:10%
This big circular gap is
sometimes caused by aircraft

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.881 align:middle line:10%
taking off and landing.

00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:39.880 align:middle line:10%
Very easy to see, right?

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:10%
Makes sense there.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:10%
And we also have the asperitas.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:10%
These are gorgeous.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:10%
This is actually my favorite.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of looking like
waves while you're underwater.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.278 align:middle line:10%
These are actually beautiful.

00:05:47.278 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:10%
Check these out.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:10%
And then finally, we
also have the big surfer

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.148 align:middle line:10%
waves of the fluctus cloud.

00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:10%
These aer actually
caused by winds

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.981 align:middle line:10%
above blowing faster than the
winds within the cloud itself.

00:05:57.981 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:10%
So you kind of get that shape.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.063 align:middle line:10%
So beautiful, right?

00:06:00.063 --> 00:06:02.632 align:middle line:10%
There's just a sample of the
new additions that we have.

00:06:02.632 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:10%
Meteorologists, sky
watchers, daydreams--

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.532 align:middle line:10%
we're all geeking out, guys.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:90%
What do you guys think?

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That weather
caster, Scott, is wired.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:90%
She is bubbly, uptempo.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's going on here
with all these new clouds?

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's like
a zoologist finding

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:90%
a new species of animals.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But George, the nice thing about
this show is it's streamed.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And we can go back and we can
explain some of those clouds.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:10%
The very first one they showed--

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.989 align:middle line:10%
you can actually see a gap
in the middle of the cloud

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:10%
where there's a square cut out.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
a hole in there.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.602 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: A hole,
a square hole.

00:06:32.602 --> 00:06:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And then on each
side of that hole,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
there are other
circular openings.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's a geometry, a
resonance in the atmosphere

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:84%
that these clouds are
literally forced to conform to.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we've got these
new classifications of clouds--

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:84%
because the water vapor
and the etheric energy

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:84%
is forced to conform to some
kind of resonance vibration.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember
in my day, we

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
had the cumulus clouds
and the cirrus clouds

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:90%
and a couple other ones.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: They're still here.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're still here.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But now when did these
new ones come in?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I believe
in the '70s--

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.430 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've been
around that long?

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.016 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: More than likely.

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And if we had had
iPhones in the '70s,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
we would see more grotesque
or extreme examples of these.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And as this weather
modification tech

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:84%
has evolved as we have added
more and more chemtrail

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
flights, then we can fine
tune, refine, and tone

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.209 align:middle line:84%
down the bizarreness
of these clouds.

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are those all
man made that we just saw?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: In my
opinion, absolutely.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, they wouldn't be new.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Man made on purpose or
man made because of whatever?

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: As a byproduct
of what they're doing.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:90%
As a byproduct.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.762 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this dangerous?

00:07:53.762 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That goes
back to the effects.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't
necessarily think so.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a good thing?

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think
it's amazing that we

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.810 align:middle line:84%
can do these things-- that
we've got that tech out there.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all about how we use it.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
A hammer is a great
thing until you still

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
go knocking people out rather
than hitting nails and building

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever hit
your finger with a hammer

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:90%
when you miss the nail?

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:90%
It hurts.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I've done that.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:90%
It hurts.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And so those
malformed clouds are

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.134 align:middle line:84%
the bruises on your thumbs of
missing the nail on the hammer.

00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did that weather
caster seem so excited

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:90%
about those new clouds?

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's her job.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:90%
It's her job.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a little TV hype?

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, it's a hype.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.680 align:middle line:90%
There's new clouds.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:90%
There's discovery.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:84%
We've been able to get these new
formations and these new shapes

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:90%
names and classifications.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But if they weren't
new, they would

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
have been in the old cloud
atlases from the 1890s

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.830 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will there be newer
clouds as well beyond what

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.060 align:middle line:90%
we just saw?

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.551 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think
it's inevitable.

00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:90%
I think it's inevitable.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we will discover
or already have discovered--

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and maybe I just
haven't seen yet--

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:84%
other technologies able to
play with the etheric field

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and with scalar tech
and with acoustics.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And all these
other techs are all

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
going to manifest differently
in different water vapor

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:90%
environments.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scott, what
clouds create rain?

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Typically nimbus.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nimbus clouds.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Those are old-time clouds.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah,
the old standby.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
new ones we just saw,

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:90%
will you get rain out of those?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: You can.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:84%
If the water droplet is allowed
to form to the correct size,

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
the gravity will take over
and bring it out of the sky.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, those wave clouds
that we saw at the very end

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
where you have the
scalloping looks at the top--

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that's simply one layer of
the atmosphere racing very,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:84%
very quickly above a static
or sometimes even retrograding

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.834 align:middle line:90%
layer of the atmosphere.

00:09:55.834 --> 00:09:58.125 align:middle line:84%
And we'll look at some trails
here in a little bit that

00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
will let you see
literally one trail moving

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:90%
like this across another.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you said that
these started maybe around

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.540 align:middle line:90%
the '70s--

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:90%
these newer versions.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
What was the impetus
that started that?

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And this is
speculation from the people

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that I've talked with and
come across information.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.700 align:middle line:84%
It would be the globalization
of the weather modification

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.700 align:middle line:84%
It would have happened
in the '50s and '60s

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
on a more localized basis
dealing with cloud seeding,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:84%
dealing with what may be
ground-based lasers just to see

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:84%
if we can't get some kind of
precipitation or condensation

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:84%
to form and to
grow large enough.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
But I believe if
Colonel Bearden is right

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that at some point
in the '70s, they

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
had the tech to do this
on a much larger scale.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's only
filled in the planet

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:84%
sets, meaning more and more
operations have happened.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And will there be
different kinds of cloud

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.357 align:middle line:90%
formations in the future?

00:10:55.357 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think
it's highly likely.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Highly likely.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how
many can we possibly get?

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.155 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We
don't want to know.

00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many were there?

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Nine?

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Well, they said 12.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And we saw pictures of four.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:90%
We saw pictures of four.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.036 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how many
did we have in the past?

00:11:09.036 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
In the original
cloud formations--

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:90%
the cumulus, the nimbus--

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.257 align:middle line:90%
what did we have, four or five?

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: On the
old cloud pictures--

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I had one up on my wall
and studying scouts,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
just like in geophysical
and weather stuff.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:84%
There were probably 90 to 100
different kinds of cirruses,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%
different kinds of cumulus--

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.970 align:middle line:84%
small, fair-weather
cumulus to the cumulonimbus

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that eventually
develop thunderstorms--

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:84%
the stratus and then how that
becomes a cirrostratus, which

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
is stratus up higher and then
becomes a low-cloud fog just

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:90%
off the ground.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.618 align:middle line:84%
All of these different
layers of the atmosphere

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:44.040 align:middle line:84%
have different cloud
manifestations.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin
to add electricity,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:90%
magnetism, particulates--

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pollution.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS:
--pollution, obviously.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:90%
That's a part of it.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And then there's all these
other invisible forces--

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.540 align:middle line:90%
these invisible forces.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Tesla said, once man
begins to investigate

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:84%
the invisible, in
10 years, he'll

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
learn more than
the previous 100.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to talk to
you about hail for a moment.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so rare?

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen a lot.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
You would think that
it would and that we'd

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:90%
be pelted by brick-size hail.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:90%
We're not all the time.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Where is it coming from?

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: There's a couple
of ways to approach this.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Hail is more regular at
certain latitudes than others.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
You tend to have them, say,
on the front range of Colorado

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
or out into the
plains during spring.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
During the springtime when the
freezing level is still low,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:84%
you still get the turbulence
or the violent updrafts.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And then that water molecule
ices over and melts,

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and you get this
looping going on.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But what I've also
seen is thunderstorms,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:84%
instead of developing vertically
or slightly at a slant,

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
are tipped over like
this as that wave cloud.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing tops of the
atmosphere rolling very, very

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:84%
fast and the bottom moving
in a different direction.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So what this happens is that
you can have a thunderstorm that

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
at the top, the radar only sees
it at maybe 35,000 feet where

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
in the old days it might
have been a 45,000-foot top.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:84%
But the length is
actually extended.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
thing is spiraling.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you can have in
this electrical field--

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
because once you get
ice and water rotating,

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
you're going to create a current
and an electrical suspension

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:90%
field as well.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.175 align:middle line:84%
So then you can get
hail larger and larger.

00:13:27.175 --> 00:13:31.836 align:middle line:84%
So there may be places
that see less hail simply

00:13:31.836 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
because they're under
a drought agenda.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the biggest
hail you've ever seen?

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: A little bit larger
than golf ball, and that hurt.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:90%
That hurt.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.899 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, that could bust
a windshield of a car, right?

00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:46.065 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And if you're a
gardener, you're crying--

00:13:46.065 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:90%
or a farmer.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you get
hit by one of these.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:90%
They're ice balls, right?

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.428 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah,
they're ice balls.

00:13:50.428 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're watching
your crops shredded--

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:90%
shredded.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very
dangerous-- and I don't want

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:90%
to say it's easy to create.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But with this tech, you
can create those things.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
You can create devastating
swaths of thunderstorms

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:90%
that just strip fields.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And corn hit in second week
of August by a hailstorm--

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:90%
it's tough to recover from.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a roof
repaired once, Scotty,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:84%
because hail damaged
it over the years.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:90%
I called my insurance company.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And a guy came out and
said, this roof is totaled.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And it had been pelted
over the years with hail.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty damaging stuff.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It is.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you had a
composite roof--

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:84%
the asphalt one-- it's
good for about 20 years.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you hit it with
hail numerous times--

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bang.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like tenderizing meat.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.150 align:middle line:90%
It turns to mush quickly.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a controversy
over something called

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.532 align:middle line:90%
chemtrails.

00:14:46.532 --> 00:14:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I haven't
heard of them.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
You may wake up in the
morning, and the skies

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:90%
are perfectly clear.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Later in the afternoon, you
see these tic-tac-toe patterns

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not just jet vapor.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the fuel
residual from jets.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Those patterns aren't
there every day.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:84%
They would be because these
planes fly the same direction

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.146 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:15:16.146 --> 00:15:17.500 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:90%
What are chemtrails?

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: As I got into my
geoengineering rabbit hole,

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize it was
going to be so large.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And I came to terms with
clouds and pictures--

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:90%
and we'll see some in a bit--

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that there were shapes and
clouds that shouldn't be there.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But then the next step was, how
do they organize the weather

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:90%
that they're creating?

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.929 align:middle line:84%
And it took some time-lapse
cameras on my part

00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and some computers
and some software.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.553 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're convinced.

00:15:46.553 --> 00:15:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I just
needed to know.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:90%
I needed to know.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the
air at the time,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and I still had a
responsibility to an audience.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't like coming on and
saying, I goofed a forecast.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:90%
My bad.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't my bad.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
The storm didn't perform
as it was modeled

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:90%
and historically would have.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was unpredictable.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.554 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Something
was going on.

00:16:06.554 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So I put these cameras up just
to see what the clouds were

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:90%
doing that I was missing.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
that I can catch?

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I can give my audience
a more genuine forecast.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But it was the chemtrails
that showed up.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And there were patterns.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.615 align:middle line:84%
The trail would come along,
leave a little bit of it,

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and then another one would
come along and hit right

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
at the middle of that
little leftover trail that

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:90%
was there or hit it at the end.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Or the trail spread
a little part of it.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And then another plane
came along exactly

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and hit it precisely at the
direction it was spreading.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I see what they're doing.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
They're sculpting the
weather in real time

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:90%
by where these planes are.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But why?

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.123 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And they
just leave a trail

00:16:50.123 --> 00:16:52.067 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what the
heck they're doing.

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they experimenting?

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.816 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.

00:16:54.816 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:90%
That was the '60s and '70s.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they know
what they're doing now.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We're
full-on operation.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.058 align:middle line:90%
They know what they're doing.

00:16:59.058 --> 00:17:02.996 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always remember when
the Chinese had the Olympics.

00:17:02.996 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said, what are you
going to do about the weather?

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And they went, we
control the weather.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.907 align:middle line:84%
That was an
incredible revelation.

00:17:09.907 --> 00:17:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: We can do that.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was '09, so
almost a decade ago.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And I came on this in
2003, 2004, and 2005--

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.640 align:middle line:90%
is when I'm like, no, no, no.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:90%
This has got to be known.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought the
meteorology community

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:90%
would be far more interested.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.361 align:middle line:90%
I really did.

00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:26.776 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at some
pictures of chemtrails, Scott,

00:17:26.776 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:90%
and we'll talk about these.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.254 align:middle line:84%
And you can just illustrate
what we're looking at.

00:17:31.254 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, what are we
looking at here?

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: Well, this goes
back to essentially how to site

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:10%
a proper weather location.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:10%
On the bottom
slide where it says

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.484 align:middle line:10%
MMTS shelter-- that's where
the weather observing is.

00:17:45.484 --> 00:17:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And you've got a
cell tower there.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:90%
You've got a heating exhaust.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.357 align:middle line:84%
So we have a global
warming problem, George.

00:17:51.357 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about that?

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've heard about that.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.816 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So a
large part of that

00:17:54.816 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
comes from where they
put the instruments.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to get a person's
proper body temperature

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.744 align:middle line:84%
if you hold it in the hand
or you put it in the mouth?

00:18:02.744 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As the mouth.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.251 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're doing
is putting these sites,

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and over-- so we can
go to the next slide.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Over 90% of them are
incorrectly sited.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So they're in the wrong
location to get proper

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
what would have been
legal observations back

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle line:90%
in the '40s, '50s, and '60s.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:90%
But this all began in the '80s.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you saying
that this skews the testing?

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.832 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:18:27.832 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because
your days are warmer.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So we get wrong data.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: We get wrong data.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.401 align:middle line:90%
Straight up, we get wrong data.

00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And when the automated sites
went in in Phoenix and Tucson

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:90%
1988, '89.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
If you look back, that summer,
Phoenix broke 20 record highs

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.377 align:middle line:90%
in July, maybe 15 in June.

00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Astounding.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.376 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah, astounding.

00:18:49.376 --> 00:18:51.570 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
what's happened?

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.620 align:middle line:90%
101 became 105.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And that way, when you
go back in history, boom.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.402 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we have global warming.

00:18:59.402 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:90%
And they can say, yeah.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:84%
The data says that the
surface data is correct.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:84%
No, it's because of improper
placement of the sensors.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.583 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at our next one here.

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And this
goes into that.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
CRN 5 in the box
shows the rating.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the air 5
degrees Celsius off.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.966 align:middle line:10%
So that's 6.2% of all stations
are off 5 degrees Celsius.

00:19:20.966 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: It's major.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:10%
It's huge.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you look, category
4 concludes 64.4% of them,

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
or nearly 2/3 of them, are off
by more than 2 degrees Celsius.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.562 align:middle line:84%
That's nearly 4
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:19:35.562 --> 00:19:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are all those
dots on the bottom slide?

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: The bottom slide are
the plots for all the stations

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:90%
that had been surveyed.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that, by the
way, is the map of the US

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:90%
if you can't see it.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.935 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And
that really should

00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:84%
have had a plain political
background and not

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:84%
an ag background or
showing the topography.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
it shows how much

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:90%
orange and red is on that map.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And even the yellow is
greater than 1 degree Celsius,

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
or 1.8 Fahrenheit.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And the whole IPCC,
the International Panel

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:90%
on Climate Change--

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:84%
they're thinking 1.5 degrees
is enough to melt the poles.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we've got that
much bad data going in

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
that already has this
over that threshold--

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.439 align:middle line:84%
Our next one is just
some verbiage here.

00:20:17.439 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:90%
What are we reading here?

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: All the adjustments
that we're seeing in the data

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.610 align:middle line:10%
are adjusting to the warm side.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:10%
So they're cooling off data
from the '20s, '30s, '40s.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the unadjusted
data, it's nearly a flat line.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:10%
When you adjust it, they're
cooling off the earlier ages

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:10%
and then warming up
the current decades.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it says, this
study found measurements nearly

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
always exhibited a steeper
warming linear trend

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:90%
over its entire history.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean, Scott?

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It means that we're
adding steepness or gradation

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:84%
to the increase in
temperature that

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist in the raw data.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.050 align:middle line:84%
We're streaming, so you
can pause this and read it.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.974 align:middle line:10%
So the problem is
that the research--

00:21:00.974 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:10%
we're finding the global surface
temperatures just are not

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:10%
being represented accurately.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And so the data is corrupt.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you put bad data into a
future forecasting model, what

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.812 align:middle line:90%
are you going to get out of it?

00:21:12.812 --> 00:21:13.611 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bad data.

00:21:13.611 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Bad data.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the doctor
taking your vitals

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and your heart rate's 68,
and he writes down 85.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Your BP is normal.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.116 align:middle line:90%
So then the question is the sun.

00:21:27.116 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which has
a lot to do with it.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: You think?

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.136 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: The sun comes up.

00:21:31.136 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:90%
It gets warm.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.146 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, they're
talking about other planets

00:21:34.146 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system
are heating up.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they have
factories or cars or anything

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:90%
else affecting it.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.123 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And they don't
have necessarily the same type

00:21:42.123 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:90%
of atmosphere that we do.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.586 align:middle line:90%
So it's all changing.

00:21:46.586 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, that's
a weird chemtrail.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.501 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It is-- the top one.

00:21:49.501 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how the
bright part of the top 2/3

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.830 align:middle line:90%
of that vertical trail flips.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:84%
The powders coming out
literally do kind of a rotation,

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:84%
like it's a curtain
dropping in the sky.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And then they're being
folded towards the left

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:90%
before the gap appears.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this plane that
came right through that opening

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:90%
where that trail disappeared.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So do you really think
that pilot and that plane

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:90%
just happened to randomly--

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:90%
let's find that little opening.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
The air's going to be
clearer there, George?

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Should we shoot that?

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the bottom
picture there of the jet--

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:90%
that looks like jet trail--

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:90%
the bottom one.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: But it's a chemtrail.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that
one's a chemtrail, too.

00:22:33.298 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Because of
its precise interception

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:90%
of the other chemtrail.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.494 align:middle line:90%
And you could see it hit right--

00:22:41.494 --> 00:22:43.743 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could get in front
of there and point at it--

00:22:43.743 --> 00:22:44.660 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:84%
There's this opening
of this trail,

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and it came right through the
exact center of that opening.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many jets do
they use during any given day

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:90%
in a location like Los Angeles?

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: All of them.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that would be what?

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.638 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: All of them.

00:22:59.638 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Thousands upon thousands
upon thousands.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of planes?

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Of
planes-- thousands.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.617 align:middle line:90%
There's a set payload.

00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the pilots
know what's going on?

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: You know they don't.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.436 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have to.

00:23:09.436 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: They have to know.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:90%
But do they want to live?

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Do they want their retirement?

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to?

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.316 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they keep
their mouths shut.

00:23:17.316 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: They do,
and they have to.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:90%
They have to.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:84%
They really don't have a
choice because the planes

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
are the easiest thing to crash
when they're not flying it.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.230 align:middle line:84%
It's all computers
now because there's

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:90%
an AI flying these things.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
So that particular-- if
we go to the next slide,

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:90%
I think we've got a picture of--

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:84%
that plane was a
Southwest flight.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And it just happened
to be right there

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:90%
to hit that spot perfectly.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.117 align:middle line:84%
So over this other one,
there was just a little--

00:23:44.117 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:90%
we've got two little chemtrails.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But you can see on the left
side of this brighter cirrus

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:90%
that there's a peak.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:90%
There's a shape in there.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And these trails
are there literally

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
to make what's
invisible visible.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So those particles will
make these deformations,

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
these perturbations in
the atmosphere visible.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
This one-- so the bottom
part of the trail--

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:84%
you can see it has a little
zigzag in it-- a little zigzag.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's weird.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.375 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So why would
that part of the atmosphere

00:24:16.375 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
literally do this kind of
shearing next to each other?

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:84%
One part didn't move, and the
lower part moved up like this.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
discontinuity in where

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.830 align:middle line:90%
the atmosphere is moving.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in that are all
kinds of chemicals-- aluminum,

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:90%
barium, all kinds of things.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: What's in there is
what they need to make it seen.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:90%
They've got sensors in space.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So they can sitilate, literally
make the aluminum, the barium,

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.970 align:middle line:84%
the strontium,
whatever other trace

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
elements are in there visible.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:84%
They've got the
eyes to see that.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
this belief system

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that was controversial
for you specifically

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.476 align:middle line:90%
that caused some career issues.

00:25:00.476 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I'm OK
with that, too.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.184 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it would.

00:25:03.184 --> 00:25:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you
could have taken and toed

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:90%
the company line.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No, I couldn't.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.790 align:middle line:90%
I really couldn't.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather have been flipping
burgers then not come out

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:90%
and not talk about this.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:17.175 align:middle line:84%
Because once you know something,
you can't not share it.

00:25:17.175 --> 00:25:20.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it frustrating
for you initially?

00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:22.625 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got a lot of
red tape from management,

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:23.690 align:middle line:90%
did you not?

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I did a little bit.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.080 align:middle line:84%
But in hindsight,
George, that seems

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
like it was such a
brief period in time.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Because I went public--

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I published to a blog in
October of '04, and I was let go

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:35.909 align:middle line:90%
in September of '05.

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of that.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.075 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Because of that.

00:25:38.075 --> 00:25:40.370 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:90%
I used my KPVI.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I used the call letters when I
set it off and got published.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.369 align:middle line:90%
You kind of have to.

00:25:46.369 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I would
have-- as a news director--

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.620 align:middle line:84%
would have relished the fact
that my weather caster was

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:84%
getting some
national publicity--

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: You would think.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --on stuff like that.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.126 align:middle line:90%
I would have used it.

00:25:56.126 --> 00:25:56.925 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yep.

00:25:56.925 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And that could have gone
a very different way--

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:90%
the whole evolvement.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I still didn't
know at that point in time

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.880 align:middle line:84%
was how it was being
done, the technology used,

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:84%
the extent of the trails,
how they played in.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I had only the most
basic of outline

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
to know that what
I was forecasting

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:90%
wasn't what I was forecasting.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole other agenda
that I was not privy to,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
whether it was to
rain or to snow.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:84%
What I did learn was,
forecast the trend.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is happening-- if it
looks like it's going to rain,

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:84%
this is just a
little bit of a spit.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to
get much out of this.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And go with the
trend, and you'll

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:90%
out-forecast all your peers.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it difficult
today for weather forecasters

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:90%
to predict the weather?

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's painful
for me to watch them.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:90%
It really is-- to watch them.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And the graphics they
put up are cartoonish.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:90%
There's no resolution.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no details.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like the bubbly
forecaster showing us

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:90%
the shiny new clouds.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a facade.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.330 align:middle line:90%
The science is gone.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a facade to play to
the "Entertainment Tonight"

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I do my own forecasting.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a weather forecaster.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll look at a radar map.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'll see that over
Colorado, there's rain.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll predict
the speed of that.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, this is going to
hit St. Louis in three days.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have rain in
three days, and I'm right.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.286 align:middle line:84%
And as that storm would leave
the west and head out east,

00:27:28.286 --> 00:27:30.618 align:middle line:84%
you're going to assume we're
going to get to south wind.

00:27:30.618 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:84%
The moisture will
be caught up in it.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.769 align:middle line:84%
That thing will
continue to develop.

00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:90%
It's all logical.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:90%
It's training.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:90%
There's a little science.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to the TV
aspect of it, it's training.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion,
why modify the weather?

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Because you can.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Because you can.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And that way, it becomes
a tool for somebody

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:90%
who will give you the money.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I really believe there's
a darkness on this planet.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones that
have co-opted these programs.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They may have been the
ones that were even

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:84%
the inspiration for the program
if we go to Project Paperclip

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and bringing back
scientists from Germany,

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.160 align:middle line:90%
from World War II.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:10%
And you get those
minds over here

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.840 align:middle line:10%
plus what we were working
on, and you get it together.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing
like a bunch of guys

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:10%
getting together and
coming up with ideas

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:10%
and fantastic things.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And then corporations
and governments

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.342 align:middle line:90%
are willing to write a check.

00:28:24.342 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Because if they don't
have to share the secrets

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:84%
with the people,
that we can do this,

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
then it's kind of like
an orgy of science.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.860 align:middle line:90%
That's exciting.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
When they give the tools over
to the military or to the users,

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.700 align:middle line:90%
will there be culpability?

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:10%
Will there be responsibility
and accountability?

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.170 align:middle line:10%
Will there be
eventually sunshine

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:10%
on these projects that were
shepherded 60, 70 years ago?

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:90%
When does that happen?

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's global dimming?

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Global dimming--
that kind of came into vogue

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.214 align:middle line:90%
about 20 years ago.

00:29:01.214 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And we've even
launched satellites

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:84%
to go find the aerosols that
seem to be in the sky dimming

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:90%
the sunshine.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they just hang
up there and loom up there?

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Yeah,
they're just suspended.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And we end up with these
kind of milky-white days.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.820 align:middle line:84%
The sky is blue, but
we started earlier.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.720 align:middle line:84%
It gets a little
hazier and hazier.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:84%
We tried to launch
two satellites

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
to find out where these
aerosols were coming from.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.159 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't know?

00:29:27.159 --> 00:29:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Good question.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were looking
for point sources.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Is it industry in China?

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Is it industry in India?

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it manufacturing, or is it
the natural gas production?

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it fracking?

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.340 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So the first two satellites
failed to reach orbit.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.317 align:middle line:90%
How convenient.

00:29:45.317 --> 00:29:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: How convenient.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So there is something
that they didn't

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:51.630 align:middle line:84%
want discovered about where
are these aerosols were coming

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:52.430 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And that was the early
part of this decade when

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.380 align:middle line:90%
those failed to make orbit.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems like then
you're dealing with two

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:90%
different factions--

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:84%
factions that know what's going
on because they're doing it

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.306 align:middle line:84%
and another faction that is not
part of it trying to figure out

00:30:09.306 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:90%
what the heck is happening.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I agree.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.260 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I think they've
compartmentalized

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:90%
the scientific community.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:84%
They've compartmentalized
whether it's

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.710 align:middle line:84%
solar research versus
atmospheric chemistry

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:25.040 align:middle line:84%
versus cloud physics
versus modeling

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.990 align:middle line:84%
versus public outreach versus
oceanography versus climate

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.790 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
all of these boxes,

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:84%
only the people at
the top of the pyramid

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:84%
are going to be able
to put it all together

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:90%
for their own purposes.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this modification
program worldwide?

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.222 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely.

00:30:44.222 --> 00:30:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're going
to go back early

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.290 align:middle line:84%
on when we started
throwing rocks in the pond.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.320 align:middle line:84%
The first rock goes in,
easy to see the ripple.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.840 align:middle line:84%
The second, the third, and
the fourth, and the fifth,

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.590 align:middle line:84%
it begins to contaminate
the entire planet.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And another question I got about
that were these trails in China

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.030 align:middle line:90%
and Russia.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.680 align:middle line:84%
If you get a flight
tracking app,

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:84%
like Flightradar24,
spend the $3.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Get the upgraded version.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:90%
It's cheap.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.990 align:middle line:84%
It's cheap compared to what
software cost 20 years ago.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:13.010 align:middle line:90%
It's cheap.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how
many of these planes

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:84%
will fly from the United
Arab Emirates to London.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.700 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.160 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
great circle routes.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's all of our
Western aircraft flying

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:32.900 align:middle line:84%
across China and Russia and
all these other seemingly

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.340 align:middle line:90%
independent nations.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So they're subject to
these actions as well.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So with
this global dimming,

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.955 align:middle line:84%
does it have to do
with solar cycles?

00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: That's something
that's been looked at.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:84%
The main part of that
would be cosmic rays

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and how activity on the sun
can then spark cloud growth

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and if those additional
clouds would change

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:00.020 align:middle line:84%
the reflectivity of those clouds
and the solar energy going back

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:90%
into space.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.220 align:middle line:90%
So there's a yes and no.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is, there's
this block of science.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
cloud physics and how

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.630 align:middle line:84%
that plays into the solar
scientists over here.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So we need to kind of get these
people all on the same page

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and working on the
same papers so we

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.959 align:middle line:84%
can get more definitive
answers with these things.

00:32:19.959 --> 00:32:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Scott,
while we continue

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.260 align:middle line:84%
talking about global
dimming, there

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of graphs that, of
course, point that out to us.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Explain this for us.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: This is solar cycles.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:84%
This is going to come
into the play of,

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.350 align:middle line:84%
might the sun have anything
to do with long-term climate

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.770 align:middle line:90%
trends?

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we think it does.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.079 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We kind
of believe we do,

00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:42.320 align:middle line:84%
since we were able to associate
the Maunder minimum back

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.142 align:middle line:84%
in the 1600, 1700s with a
period of virtually no sunspots.

00:32:46.142 --> 00:32:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
little mini ice age

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.720 align:middle line:84%
that correlated rather
nicely with that.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a
causation event.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:10%
And so what we're seeing here
are the last four solar cycles,

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:10%
the blue being the oldest one--
the key is in the upper right--

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.409 align:middle line:10%
from 1976 to '86.

00:33:02.409 --> 00:33:03.700 align:middle line:10%
That's when I got into weather.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.810 align:middle line:10%
And the sun was very active.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do
you mean by active?

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.030 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: The
count of sunspots.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:10%
And so what we're
looking at on this chart

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:10%
is the number of sunspots
counted in a single month.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:10%
So we'll take 12 months and
add them up, do an average,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:10%
and then that's the number.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.480 align:middle line:10%
So we were running
in the 200s back

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.921 align:middle line:10%
in the '70s and early '80s.

00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:26.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Explain what
a sunspot is for me.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.820 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: It's a magnetic
storm on the sun--

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.160 align:middle line:10%
a place that is
cooler because we're

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:10%
having an inflowing
of ejecta-- well,

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.860 align:middle line:10%
actually, material--
into the sunspot.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
circulation pattern.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So it turns over the
surface of the sun

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.574 align:middle line:84%
and brings up substance and
energy and matter from below.

00:33:44.574 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's an event of the sun.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if there
are lot of sunspots,

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.970 align:middle line:84%
that means generally we're
going to have cooler climate?

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Warmer climate.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Warmer climate.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.269 align:middle line:84%
We're active, so more
energy is coming--

00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though
the sunspot is cooler.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Thank you.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:59.000 align:middle line:84%
There's that much
more energy that it's

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.410 align:middle line:90%
agitated into the sun.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's emitting more energy.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, is
there any organization

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:84%
to the amount of sunspots that
may occur at any given year?

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Well, this is what
the sunspot cycle revealed--

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a 22-year
cycle as the polarity of the sun

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.650 align:middle line:90%
does its rotation.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.719 align:middle line:84%
So there is a max
every 11 years when

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:23.239 align:middle line:84%
the polarity, say, is
north at the top versus it

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.230 align:middle line:90%
flipping to the bottom.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
pretty timely?

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's very timely.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:27.230 align:middle line:90%
It's very timely.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So what we've learned
over the last 300 years

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.610 align:middle line:90%
is that these cycles amplify.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
eventually minor out--

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.100 align:middle line:84%
will come to a flat period
where the sun will go quiet.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.830 align:middle line:10%
And so the last cycle,
which we are presently in,

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.280 align:middle line:10%
is the purple or magenta
line towards the bottom.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:10%
And we're almost down
towards the zero.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:45.929 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if the
camera can spot that.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's pretty low.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.880 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVENS: It's very low.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.820 align:middle line:10%
And this cycle isn't done yet.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:10%
So already this year--

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember the
percentage, but it's

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:59.310 align:middle line:10%
climbing-- of sunspotless days.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
amazing lady who

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.012 align:middle line:84%
did some mathematical
correlations of two

00:35:07.012 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:84%
different layers of
magnetic fields-- one

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
at the surface of the sun
and then the layer below.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And when these layers are in
phase, the sun goes quiet.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And it only happens
every 300 years.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And when these layers
are in alignment,

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:84%
meaning less and
less disturbance,

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.120 align:middle line:84%
less and less energy coming
off, less and less agitation

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and sunspots, then
the planet cools.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.034 align:middle line:84%
And we are on the cusp
of that happening.

00:35:32.034 --> 00:35:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's great
science, by the way.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's great science.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And she has been
universally panned

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:41.420 align:middle line:84%
by the global warming
community for making

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.820 align:middle line:90%
this amazing discovery.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How dare she, right?

00:35:44.565 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: She dares.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:84%
She dares counter what
is accepted science.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's all
settled, George.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Climate science is settled.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to another
image here, Scotty.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And tell us what's
going on with this.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.652 align:middle line:90%


00:35:58.652 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So this
is a little more

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.970 align:middle line:84%
of a closeup on this
last solar cycle.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So it was the purple
line or the previous map

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:90%
that was coming to the zero.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Virtually nothing.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Like a Learjet
coming in for a landing,

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.650 align:middle line:90%
going to settle in on zero.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this last cycle from
2012, '13, '14, and '15

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.312 align:middle line:90%
had a very, very shallow peak.

00:36:19.312 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's even
crashing even further.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you understand
the sunspot cycle of the sun,

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.080 align:middle line:84%
does that help you as
a weather forecaster?

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does not?

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: No.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Not that I'm aware of.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:35.570 align:middle line:84%
We are dealing with some things
that are on a different scale,

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:37.734 align:middle line:84%
more like you
looking at the radar.

00:36:37.734 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:84%
The storm coming
out of Colorado--

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.270 align:middle line:84%
when's it going
to hit St. Louis?

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.740 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at those
kind of time frames.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we have solar
storms and geomagnetic events

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
as a result of those solar
storms, yes, those can play.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.990 align:middle line:84%
But we have not had
science up and running

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.880 align:middle line:84%
for some of these big ones,
like the Carrington event

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.880 align:middle line:90%
in the 1850s.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:03.170 align:middle line:84%
We are about to be schooled
on what the sun really

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.520 align:middle line:90%
can do to this planet.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It can be or not.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You sound
like you're warning us.

00:37:09.762 --> 00:37:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I wouldn't
be the first.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of our current
guests is Robert Felix.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.490 align:middle line:84%
He's written a book called
"Not by Fire But by Ice."

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:17.900 align:middle line:90%
He's an architect.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But he says we are in the
beginning stages of an ice age.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.905 align:middle line:84%
He's laughed at by
a lot of people.

00:37:25.905 --> 00:37:26.750 align:middle line:90%
You agree with him?

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I totally agree.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I think there will be
a time that we will

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.170 align:middle line:90%
go through this reset event.

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And whether that is concurrent
with a magnetic pole

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.420 align:middle line:84%
flip, which feels
imminent if you're

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.580 align:middle line:84%
looking at the pace
of the magnetic pole

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.390 align:middle line:84%
across the northern and southern
hemisphere-- something's up.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:90%
The magnetic field is--

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's a more
scientific term than "wonky."

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:51.450 align:middle line:90%
There is something up with it.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.335 align:middle line:84%
So I think the events
would be coinciding.

00:37:54.335 --> 00:37:55.460 align:middle line:90%
They would happen together.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
look at Felix's theory.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:10%
>> So the scientists, armed
with the best data yet regarding

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:10%
the activities of the sun, say
the Earth is headed for a mini

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.190 align:middle line:10%
ice age in just 15 years,
something that hasn't happened

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.110 align:middle line:10%
for three centuries.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:16.130 align:middle line:10%
Professor Valentina Zharkova of
the University of Northumbria

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:18.680 align:middle line:10%
presented the findings
at the National Astronomy

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.680 align:middle line:10%
Meeting in Wales this week,
Britain's "Independent"

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.640 align:middle line:10%
reported Saturday.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.900 align:middle line:10%
Researches, saying they
understand solar cycles better

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.690 align:middle line:10%
than ever, predict that
the sun's normal activity

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.960 align:middle line:10%
will decrease by
60% around 2030,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.740 align:middle line:10%
triggering the mini ice age
that could last for a decade.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.220 align:middle line:10%
The last time the Earth was hit
by such alarming solar activity

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:43.770 align:middle line:10%
happened 300 years ago
during the Maunder minimum,

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:47.990 align:middle line:10%
which lasted from 1645 to 1715.

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:50.600 align:middle line:10%
Scientists say there are
magnetic waves in the sun's

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.030 align:middle line:10%
interior that fluctuate
between the body's

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.980 align:middle line:10%
northern and
southern hemispheres,

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.280 align:middle line:10%
resulting in various solar
conditions over a period of 10

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.990 align:middle line:10%
to 12 years.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.420 align:middle line:10%
Based on that data,
researches say

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:10%
they are now better
able to anticipate

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.400 align:middle line:10%
the sun's activity, which has
led to the Zharkova team's

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:10%
prediction.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.110 align:middle line:10%
Combining both magnetic
waves together and comparing

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.660 align:middle line:10%
to real data for the
current solar cycle,

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.660 align:middle line:10%
we found that our predictions
showed inaccuracy of 97%,

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.330 align:middle line:10%
Zharkova said.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:10%
If the mini ice age
does indeed arrive,

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.070 align:middle line:10%
scientists say it
will be accompanied

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.350 align:middle line:10%
by bitter cold
winters frigid enough

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:33.410 align:middle line:10%
to cause rivers, like the Thames
in London, to freeze over.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scott,
this is fascinating.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I agree.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.190 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, because I
see a little discontinuity

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.680 align:middle line:90%
with that story.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.890 align:middle line:84%
They said the cold
would last 10 years.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
The last time it happened,
it lasted 90 years.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 90 years.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.620 align:middle line:90%
That's a long cold streak.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.078 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: So I
think at a minimum,

00:39:53.078 --> 00:39:55.130 align:middle line:84%
we should expect the
average of the two.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But more likely, we should
just repeat the previous event.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if we'd be
ready with enough natural gas

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.545 align:middle line:84%
for heating and
things like that.

00:40:01.545 --> 00:40:03.003 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Well,
let's just go back

00:40:03.003 --> 00:40:04.269 align:middle line:90%
to Tesla and be done with gas.

00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, we should.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: We really should.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we could
all have devices,

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:84%
either neighborhoods or locally,
so the cold isn't an issue.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that will happen
is that we will probably--

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:19.900 align:middle line:84%
as the cold sets in and probably
last a longer period than that.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:90%
We've had this warming period.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It has gone on, and we're likely
to go back into a 90,000-year

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:90%
cold spell--

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.450 align:middle line:90%
that we end up in greenhouses.

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:90%
We end up in geodesic domes.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We end up
protecting ourselves

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.240 align:middle line:84%
from the variabilities
of the climate

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.180 align:middle line:84%
so that we can assure
ourselves of fresh water.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.452 align:middle line:84%
We'll probably build
these things near glaciers

00:40:43.452 --> 00:40:45.410 align:middle line:84%
because the glaciers
would be far enough south.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you're at, say,
Michigan latitude,

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.400 align:middle line:84%
the glaciers could
end up that far south.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And we end up with greenhouses.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Robert Felix thinks
they could be two miles thick.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Easy.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Easy.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.059 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would cover
cities and everything else.

00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And how much
of the civilization

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.260 align:middle line:90%
would be left over once again?

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.267 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:41:06.267 --> 00:41:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It's happened before.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.830 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even with
a mini ice age?

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Maybe not so much.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.014 align:middle line:84%
But that would be enough to
deal with a population issue.

00:41:15.014 --> 00:41:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what he's
always told us was-- he

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:21.430 align:middle line:84%
says, don't get confused
over an ice age.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:23.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not continuous.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.270 align:middle line:90%
But you'll have your summers.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:29.200 align:middle line:84%
It will be warm, but
the ice doesn't melt.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes back and
the winter, accumulates more.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So then by the summertime
of the following year,

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.140 align:middle line:90%
it will melt a little bit.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But then more comes
the next year.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And then with
that, the ice caps will grow.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And each year, they'll stretch a
little closer, a little closer,

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and a little closer
to the equator,

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.850 align:middle line:84%
either north latitude from
the southern hemisphere

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:53.320 align:middle line:90%
or southward from the north.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
other climatologists

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.390 align:middle line:90%
say about this theory?

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think some
are probably on board,

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:02.110 align:middle line:90%
and most would not.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Global
warming is the agenda.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Global warming is what
pays the papers, what

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.840 align:middle line:84%
gets you published, what gets
you advanced in your career.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And why is that?

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Why can't you get
published and make

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.240 align:middle line:90%
money talking about an ice age?

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.005 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Why can't we get
a third party into politics?

00:42:22.005 --> 00:42:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Because there isn't room
for that kind of discourse

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and discussion.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.350 align:middle line:90%
There just isn't.

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.554 align:middle line:90%
You just won't have that--

00:42:29.554 --> 00:42:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to say it kindly.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.791 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
frustrating, isn't it?

00:42:32.791 --> 00:42:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It really is.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:35.350 align:middle line:90%
They become lockset.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:38.500 align:middle line:84%
They crystallize in
their point of views.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
political parties

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:84%
become crystallized
in this point of view.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the climate change
agenda has infected the left.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.350 align:middle line:84%
They're playing on
their want to do

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.340 align:middle line:90%
something good for the planet.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So their actions are
predicated on ameliorating

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:00.610 align:middle line:84%
their emotions about
what they're being told

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:84%
is happening to the planet
and no more than that.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Because if rationally we
look at this, intelligently

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:09.940 align:middle line:84%
we look at this, we look
at the science unbiasedly--

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.780 align:middle line:84%
one of the
predications of science

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.710 align:middle line:90%
is unbiased observation--

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that we would come to
these other conclusions.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.210 align:middle line:84%
But we're thinking
with our emotions,

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's corrupted
emotional thinking.

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's ultimately
the problem--

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we can't get
out of our emotions

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:84%
to think about these
things that clouds

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.580 align:middle line:90%
how we approach a problem.

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to be a downfall.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it accurate to
say that this coming ice

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.640 align:middle line:90%
age is starting now?

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I would say the sun
is signaling that very, very

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.150 align:middle line:90%
strongly.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would?

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I would.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I would.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many meteorologists
and weather forecasters would

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.800 align:middle line:90%
agree with you percentage-wise?

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Single digits.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That low?

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Oh, yeah.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Though you
think you're right.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:56.973 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Oh, yeah.

00:43:56.973 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.330 align:middle line:84%
There's always the
first one that's right.

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
is the one that's

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:04.500 align:middle line:84%
able to convince others that
the first one is correct.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what are the
telltale signs for us?

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:12.230 align:middle line:84%
What will we see to back
up what you just said?

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.344 align:middle line:90%
Longer winters?

00:44:13.344 --> 00:44:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Ultimately.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it would
be the longer winters.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, as long as we have
the contaminating effects

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.950 align:middle line:84%
of geoengineering
in play, we're not

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.800 align:middle line:84%
going to get a true read
on what's happening.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And that may be the reason
why it is happening--

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.360 align:middle line:90%
is to delay this inevitable.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
worth them going

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:38.510 align:middle line:84%
all in on the geoengineering,
chemtrail, climate change

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:90%
program--

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:44.240 align:middle line:90%
is to delay this inevitability.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you hopeful
for our outcome here?

00:44:46.787 --> 00:44:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:48.410 align:middle line:90%
We're humans.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are?

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it seems
like doom and gloom.

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.228 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying
there's hope here.

00:44:53.228 --> 00:44:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:45:01.840 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of this is
going to be a different truth,

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.530 align:middle line:84%
so we can talk
about these things.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And a part of it-- and I don't
want to be revolutionary--

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.490 align:middle line:90%
is a change in leadership--

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.070 align:middle line:84%
a change in leadership so
we can have honest discourse

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and discussion, not just in
this country, but planet wide.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.440 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this together.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.650 align:middle line:90%
And that is what excites me.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:22.200 align:middle line:90%
And I feel that that's close.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.070 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing that
happens it isn't ordained.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:27.780 align:middle line:90%
That's just how it is.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Things happen for a
reason, and so we just

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.770 align:middle line:90%
have to let this play out.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.470 align:middle line:84%
There is something very,
very beautiful, George.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And it is not that
far off in the future.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just let go
of all this doom and gloom,

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.510 align:middle line:90%
it's going to play itself out.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.650 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a single
birth that isn't painful

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:47.227 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit bloody.

00:45:47.227 --> 00:45:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But then there are tears of
joy on the other side of it.

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is it the
bottom line, Scott,

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that we are in cycles
on this planet?

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.770 align:middle line:90%
It gets warmer.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.060 align:middle line:90%
It gets Colder.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.500 align:middle line:90%
It always did.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.470 align:middle line:90%
It always will.

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And if we can't
accommodate that variability,

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:05.820 align:middle line:84%
then we need to
re-evaluate how we're

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.520 align:middle line:84%
living in our relationship
with this planet.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the same with
living along the rivers

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:90%
and along the coastlines.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.680 align:middle line:84%
They need to have
room to breathe.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.170 align:middle line:84%
It is not smart to build
up to the coastline.

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.200 align:middle line:84%
It may look great, and
it's a great vacation spot,

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.210 align:middle line:90%
but it's not very bright.

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Knowing what you know,
where would you love to live?

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:27.636 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Someplace warm.

00:46:27.636 --> 00:46:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And a move is coming in my
future, and it is to the south.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:32.610 align:middle line:90%
It is to the south.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:34.526 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll talk about
that on your radio show

00:46:34.526 --> 00:46:35.770 align:middle line:90%
in the near future.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked
about what is coming.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.810 align:middle line:90%
How do we react to that?

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.060 align:middle line:90%
There could be wars over water.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.100 align:middle line:84%
What will happen to
our food supply that

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:51.330 align:middle line:84%
relies so much on farming
if we have these colder

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:54.330 align:middle line:90%
streaks and these icier times?

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:55.480 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.938 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: We're
going to come back

00:46:56.938 --> 00:47:01.130 align:middle line:84%
to sourcing food from
inside of 200 miles.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:02.840 align:middle line:84%
That's just the way
it's going to be.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out of necessity?

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.156 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Out of necessity.

00:47:05.156 --> 00:47:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We will be forced to comply
with the way it used to be.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.980 align:middle line:84%
This whole shipping apples
from China to the States

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.900 align:middle line:84%
because the Washington
farmers don't

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.830 align:middle line:84%
do something right
or grapes from Chile

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:22.890 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
winter is idiotic.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:23.937 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to have.

00:47:23.937 --> 00:47:24.770 align:middle line:90%
It's great to have--

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or contaminated
Romaine lettuce,

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's happening
all over the place.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It is.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But it sets us up for
spectacular failures,

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:35.800 align:middle line:84%
because we have this incredibly
centralized food distribution

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.600 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And this centralization
is two things--

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.840 align:middle line:90%
ports and petroleum.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.030 align:middle line:84%
You take out one
of those things,

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:46.510 align:middle line:90%
and we can't feed ourselves.

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, if the
rivers all freeze up,

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:48.690 align:middle line:90%
what are we going to do?

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:50.981 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: If the rivers
freeze, or if we have tsunamis

00:47:50.981 --> 00:47:52.740 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific, or
we have breakdowns

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.870 align:middle line:84%
in pipeline of
petroleum distribution,

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:57.910 align:middle line:90%
there is no backup.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:00.150 align:middle line:84%
There is no backup for
tankers, for shippers,

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:01.950 align:middle line:90%
for these big ships.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:02.850 align:middle line:90%
There's no backup.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:04.891 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this going to
change the way we live?

00:48:04.891 --> 00:48:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely,
and it's supposed to.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably
already is, isn't it?

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.848 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Slowly and surely.

00:48:09.848 --> 00:48:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
out there more conscious

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:15.030 align:middle line:84%
than others who are
leading this change

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.910 align:middle line:84%
neighborhood by neighborhood,
community by community.

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:18.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening.

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, those foot
soldiers are already at work.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.060 align:middle line:84%
They're doing their job
as they're supposed to do.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Like me coming out and talking
about this topic 15 years ago,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.360 align:middle line:84%
they are creating these small
farm-to-table communities.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
that they do the work

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.710 align:middle line:90%
that they're called to do.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we going
to find ourselves

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.780 align:middle line:84%
with shorter summers,
longer winters?

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: I think, yes.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But the bigger
thing will probably

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.410 align:middle line:90%
be that it's simply drier.

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:58.712 align:middle line:84%
As the climate cools,
it will be drier.

00:48:58.712 --> 00:48:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More droughts?

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: More droughts.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Kansas is covered
with prairie now.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.739 align:middle line:90%
It may not be so green.

00:49:05.739 --> 00:49:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's shocking.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.321 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: It's only going green
because we're pumping water.

00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:11.032 align:middle line:84%
And we've nearly
extinguished a lot of--

00:49:11.032 --> 00:49:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a lot
of rain in the Midwest

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.270 align:middle line:84%
this year, but
that could change.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.394 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: It could change.

00:49:15.394 --> 00:49:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think drier
will be the key word.

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's why the greenhouses--

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.850 align:middle line:84%
to contain the evaporation
and to recycle and become--

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:27.570 align:middle line:84%
we've become units, units,
units, units, units.

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, we
look at some movies.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I remember one with
Jeff Goldblum who

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:35.190 align:middle line:90%
was predicting certain things.

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And he would tell
people in Washington,

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:90%
and nobody would listen to him.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Do we have that kind of rapport
right now in Washington where

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.780 align:middle line:84%
you've got some meteorologists
and climatologists saying,

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.310 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get
ready for this.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.060 align:middle line:90%
There's a ice age coming.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.840 align:middle line:84%
We're not prepared,
and nobody listens?

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Or do they listen?

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I think they
listen, but there is an agenda.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly, there's
an event separating that reality

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:06.110 align:middle line:90%
from right now.

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
whether it's war,

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.550 align:middle line:84%
whether it's magnetic
field change, whether it's

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:16.620 align:middle line:84%
a hit from the sun, whether
it's a volcanic eruption that

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:20.210 align:middle line:84%
clouds the planet and
precipitates this ice age.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It could be a combination
of all of those.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.660 align:middle line:10%
But there will be an
awakening of humanity.

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.230 align:middle line:10%
And it will be that
awakening and that bestowal

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.780 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness
that will allow us

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:35.190 align:middle line:10%
the awareness to navigate these
issues in these coming times.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were speaking
before a group of scientists

00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:39.300 align:middle line:90%
right now--

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.450 align:middle line:84%
climatologists-- what
would you be telling them?

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:45.500 align:middle line:90%


00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter whether
they believe you or not.

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:49.970 align:middle line:84%
But what would you
be telling them?

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Enjoy today.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy today.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:57.992 align:middle line:10%
Live for now and
put aside what--

00:50:57.992 --> 00:51:00.025 align:middle line:10%
in science, there is this rite--

00:51:00.025 --> 00:51:02.240 align:middle line:10%
R-I-T-E-- of being right--

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:06.590 align:middle line:10%
R-I-G-H-T. There's this
rite of being right.

00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And don't offend me and take
away my rite of being right.

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Old Boy Scout line--

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.960 align:middle line:90%
be prepared.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
should be doing.

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And each one has a
different place in all of this.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were somebody
living in the northern area

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of the United States,
would you move and try

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:29.630 align:middle line:90%
to go down to Florida or Texas?

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: I don't know
if that's far enough.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVENS: And I'll
leave it at that.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
that's far enough.

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:36.603 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a way to leave it.

00:51:36.603 --> 00:51:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yeah.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far down do we go?

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Farther.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Farther.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you can't.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Yes you can.

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:46.280 align:middle line:90%
You just have to want to.

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're saying
leave the country.

00:51:48.625 --> 00:51:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Or worse things.

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Or worse things.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're building
a wall, too.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep us abreast
of things, Scott.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>STEVENS: Absolutely, George.

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scott Stevens,
weather caster extraordinaire.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:03.170 align:middle line:10%
We are in the beginning stages,
he believes, of an ice age.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:05.840 align:middle line:90%
He's not alone.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Stay warm.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
