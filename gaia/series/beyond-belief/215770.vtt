>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:10%
Sheila Seppi is with
us, joining us today.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:10%
She's the founder of the
Conscious Awakening Network

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:10%
and a co-author with
one of our dear friends,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:10%
Barbara Lamb of
Cosmic Convergence--

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.980 align:middle line:10%
Journeys of walk-ins,
starseeds, and hybrids.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And a walk-in soul
herself, she is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to multidimensional
healing and spiritual awakening.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
She also channels
her future self,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:84%
an Andromedan star
mother named Tiamu.

Sheila, welcome to the program!

>>SHEILA SEPPI: Thanks so much.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a lot
to talk with you about.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.665 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh!

>>NOORY: How is Barbara doing?

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Barbara is doing great.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.437 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for asking.

00:00:58.437 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that lady.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:90%
She's just one of a kind.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Yes.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
It was very fun to
write the book with her.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
team up with her?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Actually, Barbara had
conducted a past life regression

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:90%
on me.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:10%
I had met her several
years ago, actually,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:10%
when she came here to Boulder,
and you were interviewing her.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.190 align:middle line:10%
>>SEPPI: So she did a past
life regression on me,

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:10%
and she helped me to deepen
my understanding of what

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:10%
it was to be a walk-in and to
validate a lot of the things

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:10%
that I knew but I really just
wanted a lot more clarity on.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
what a walk-in is.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, there's several
different types walk-ins.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to preface that if
this experience hadn't happened

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
to me, I'm not even sure
I would have believed

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:84%
such a thing possible, because
the type of walk-in that I am

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle line:90%
is a soul exchange walk-in.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.570 align:middle line:10%
And what that means
is the original soul,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:10%
or the natal soul, to this body
left, and a new soul came in.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And this soul was of
a higher vibration.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I actually was a very, very
sick person prior to that time.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I had been diagnosed
with bone cancer,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.759 align:middle line:90%
brain tumors, fibromyalgia--

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god!

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: --chronic fatigue.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
They said I would
be in a wheelchair

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:84%
by the time I was 48
because I had the beginning

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:90%
stages of multiple sclerosis.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I had RA, you name it.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I had a plethora of things.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And I went to bed that way.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was, as the
morning started coming around,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
I felt myself being pulled
bolt right up in bed,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and it was like lightning
ran through my body.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:90%
And then I was in white space.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know how
long I was in white space,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
but when I started
coming back to myself,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:84%
first, my peripheral vision came
in, and then my frontal vision.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm sitting there looking
around the room, of course,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:84%
the first thing I'm
thinking is, what am I

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:90%
doing sitting up in bed?

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: But the other
thing was, everything

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:90%
felt totally different.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It felt fresh.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:90%
It felt new.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
what was going on.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So when I got out of bed and
I put my feet on the carpet,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
it was as if I had never
experienced carpet before.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I walked
across the carpet

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and I caught my
reflection in the mirror,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
it was as if I was
looking at myself

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:90%
out of someone else's eyes.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, all
of my clairs came online--

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:84%
my clairvoyance,
clairaudience, clairsentience.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing people
walking around.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I was hearing them talk to me.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, I started
remembering past lives that

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
were associated with the body
because of the cellular memory

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:90%
that had been activated.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So then the next thing
that happened from there--

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
of course, now I'm
starting to think,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's something
really wrong with me

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
because I'm losing
it, because I started

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:84%
remembering healing modalities
that I had never studied.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of these universal
truths and quantum physics

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
information was running
around in my mind.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And I had never,
ever studied, nor had

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:90%
I had an interest in that.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I had never
even read a metaphysical book

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:90%
in my entire life.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And over the course of
the next three months,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:90%
everything about me changed.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
My personality 100%
changed from the way

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
that I dressed, to the way
I articulated my sentences,

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to the foods that I ate, to the
people that I surrounded myself

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You became
a different person.

00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: I was a totally
different person.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Within three months, I
also left that marriage

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
because there was
no resonance, and it

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:90%
was already dysfunctional.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:84%
No doubt that was part of
the illness that I had.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:90%
But everything about me changed.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:90%
And I had three small children.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the beautiful
things about that

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
was, for the first
time in their life,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:90%
I was able to play with them.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:90%
I could run.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.802 align:middle line:90%
I could jump with them.

00:04:57.802 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:90%
We could go to the park.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They had mommy back.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Exactly.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, they'd never had mommy.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:90%
They had her for the first time.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very exciting
time for them as well.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
But as time went on,
everybody around me

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:84%
just sort of
started fading away.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I lost all of my friends.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Family started looking at me
like I was a little odd, as I

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:90%
started to share this story.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.475 align:middle line:84%
But then as I started
going through the divorce,

00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
there were a few
people that said

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:84%
you know what, you can't talk
about this walk-in thing,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
because if you do, you might
have your children taken away.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:90%
So I clammed up about it.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And actually, for years,
I felt uncomfortable

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:90%
in certain situations.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But after those
first three months,

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I started really
anchoring into the body.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I moved to
a different state.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I found
my first spiritual teacher,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:90%
actually, by accident.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for a therapist
because I thought maybe

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.010 align:middle line:90%
I was losing my mind.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:90%
I had--

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: --no other
explanation than maybe I

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.200 align:middle line:84%
was having a psychotic
break to everything that

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
was happening to me,
because 25 years ago, it's

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
not like you had the
internet that you could

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:84%
start typing all
your symptoms into

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.683 align:middle line:90%
and have something to come up.

00:06:21.683 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: And there was no
one to talk to about this.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So my therapist actually
was of Hopi lineage,

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.067 align:middle line:90%
and she herself was a walk-in.

00:06:31.067 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She got it.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: And she recognized.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She got it.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: She got it.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did the
old soul go, Sheila?

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: When a walk-in,
especially a soul exchange

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:84%
walk-in, occurs, that
soul leaves the body.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, people have to understand--

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wasn't that you?

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, that was
the natal soul to the body.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I am a brand-new
soul to this body.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
with the other soul

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:84%
is they left to continue their
expansion on the other side,

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
or to maybe incarnate
on a different planet.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened to them.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But any time that a
soul exchange occurs

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:84%
or any type of soul
augmentation happens,

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
it has to be written in a
birth plan or a pre-birth plan.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my case, I am part
of a collective of beings.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So when I came in, I
brought in an aspect

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that would be at the strongest
resonance with this weak body.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what caused
the instantaneous healing,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
because the soul vibrated
at a different frequency.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
As it entered in, it was able
to anchor into the physical form

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:90%
without frying the biology.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:90%
And then the healing took place.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila, what
initiated the walk-in?

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Who created it?

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Did you do that, or did
some entity do this?

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, actually,
before I incarnated,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I was part of a collective
of beings that was actually

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
working on the crystalline
grid that surrounds the planet.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And when the soul--

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're talking
about the soul or you?

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Me.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
The aspect of the
soul that I am now

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:84%
is part of a larger
group of souls,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:90%
which is called The Collective.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So that includes my
Arcturian, Andromedan,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:84%
all of the various
lifetimes that I have ever

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
participated in all of the
multidimensional lifetimes.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of those souls
come back together

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:90%
in what's called The Collective.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people refer
to that as an oversoul,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:90%
but because we were actually--

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:84%
had moved into the
seventh density,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:84%
we had begun to assimilate
with other souls,

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:90%
and we began to merge.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And so Gaia sent out a resonance
call, and we came to the Earth

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and assisted with the
awakening codes and the repair

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:90%
of the crystalline grid.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So when the soul of this body
cried out to be released,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
The Collective decided
that I, the person

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
you're speaking to
right now, would

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:90%
be the aspect that comes in.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still fully
connected with my Collective.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
what's happening--

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
let's say if I'm conducting
a healing session--

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I may have more of my
Arcturian energy that comes in,

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
or more Andromedan energy, or I
might have angelic energy that

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
begins to flow
through me as I work

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
on the holographic
structure of a person.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you miss
the other soul at all?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: No.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I miss the other
soul, because when I came in,

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I actually had
very few memories.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I did remember my children.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I had a few beautiful, special
memories of my children,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.270 align:middle line:84%
as well as my parents, but
I was very disconnected

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:90%
from everyone else.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Over time, through
being shown photographs

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and meeting with
other family members,

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I've started to
create new memories.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:84%
I've started to
remember a few things

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:90%
after being shown photographs.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:84%
But the reality of it is,
when I came into this body,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I came in as the person that's
sitting here in front of you

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:84%
without the memories
of that other person.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then you came into
contact with Barbara Lamb.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:90%
How did that magic occur?

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: We actually had
been attending the Starworks

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Conference in Nevada.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was introduced
to her, and she told me

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:84%
that she was coming to
actually be interviewed by you.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, Barbara,
I live in Leadville.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Can I come and have a session?

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I'm only
going to do one session.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.432 align:middle line:84%
And since you ask, yes,
you can have that session.

00:10:59.432 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you
collaborated on the book?

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:01.955 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: We did.

00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cosmic Convergence.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: We stayed
very-- mm-hmm.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:84%
We stayed very close
friends for a long time,

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:90%
and we conversed back and forth.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:10%
And when I wrote the book, I
called Barbara, and I said,

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:10%
Barbara, I would love to
have you to contribute

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:10%
some of the case studies about
walk-ins, starseeds and hybrids.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So as I began to
write other portions,

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
she began to fine-tune
all of the case studies.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.385 align:middle line:84%
And then we would
work back and forth,

00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:90%
and I'd pick up the phone--

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Barbara, what do you think
about this paragraph?

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Barbara, what do you
think about that?

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.683 align:middle line:84%
So it was a really
fun experience.

00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Sheila,
throughout the program,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
tonight, we're going to be
tapping into Barbara Lamb

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Yeah.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And here is she
talking about the book

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Cosmic Convergence that
the two of you wrote.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.240 align:middle line:10%
>>BARBARA LAMB: My
name is Barbara Lamb,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:10%
and I am the co-author of
the book Cosmic Convergence.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I have known Sheila Seppi
for several years now

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and have actually worked with
her in regression sessions

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:84%
to find out more details
about her being a walk-in.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
When Sheila launched upon
writing this wonderful book,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:84%
she invited me to participate
and to give some case studies

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
of walk-ins and
starseeds and hybrids.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, since
1991, I have been

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
working with many
people who have

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
had extraterrestrial experiences
and who are walk-ins, starseeds,

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:90%
and hybrids.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I have done hypnotic regressions
with them to find out

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
more about their journey, and
how they came here, and did

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
a soul exchange
with somebody here,

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and how they are here to live
a life of wonderful service

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:90%
to humanity.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So it gives a
wonderful grounding,

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
a personal interest aspect to
the book Cosmic Convergence.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
To really hear
summaries of the work

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that I've done with several
walk-ins, a few starseeds,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and a few ET human hybrids who
are living here amongst us,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:84%
it's been a great
privilege to be

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
part of this book
and part of sharing

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:90%
this kind of information.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that most
people just don't know

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:90%
about these types of people.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
remarkable person!

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Yes.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't she
inspirational all the way?

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Absolutely.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila, tell us
about Cosmic Convergence.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: I really enjoyed
writing this book.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the front, the
entire first section

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:84%
is dedicated to discussing some
of the multidimensional aspects

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.390 align:middle line:90%
about the universe.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:84%
We talk about dimensions
and densities.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
We talk about timelines
and parallel universes.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I also talk about the
holographic grid of the body

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and how it connects out
to the holographic grid

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.910 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we delve deep into
a discussion about walk-ins.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And then Barbara has case
studies about walk-ins.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
We talk about starseeds,
and Barbara has

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:90%
case studies about starseeds.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we talk about
hybrids, and Barbara has

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
the case studies about hybrids.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was my intention
when we wrote this book

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that it would serve really
as a manual for people,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
because I've tried to take
some of those concepts that

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
came in with me when I first
arrived and break them down

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
into digestible chunks so
people can pick up the book.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:90%
They can flip through.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:84%
They can read a section,
put it down, digest it,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
pick it back up, read
another section, digest it.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote it as
if I was writing it

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.473 align:middle line:84%
for myself as just having
come onto this planet.

00:15:14.473 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we were
talking about walk-ins,

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:84%
but give us your
definition of starseeds.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, a
starseed is a soul that

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:84%
has come from either a
planetary system, a realm,

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:84%
or they have come directly
from a particular planet.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, when starseeds
come to this planet,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:84%
they bring with them a
plethora of information.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Typically, they're still
connected in some ways

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to their own star
families, so they're

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:84%
able to bring in higher
vibrational frequencies

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and anchor those
onto the planets.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And many of them will bring in
a variety of healing modalities

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And hybrids would be?

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Hybrids
are ETs and human.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:04.020 align:middle line:84%
With a hybrid, there are several
different types of hybrids.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about the Secret kind

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.300 align:middle line:90%
of hybrids that go on.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking
about are actually

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.470 align:middle line:84%
hybrids that have
extraterrestrial DNA

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%
and human DNA.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And that can occur
several different ways.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
One way is a woman can actually
be pregnant, taken onto a craft,

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and interjected through
her belly button

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:90%
with a special type of DNA.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It can--

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like classic
abduction case.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: It could be.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that I find

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
is, as I have worked with people
who themselves say that they

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:84%
have been abducted, they begin
to realize that on some level,

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
on a soul level, that may have
been written into their birth

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:90%
plan.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And they find that
they also may be

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
part of that genetic lineage
of those beings that took them.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So not all abductions are
what we would say scary.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them-- women will
actually be taken onto craft,

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.438 align:middle line:84%
and they get to visit with
their own hybrid children.

00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know it's their kid?

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: They do.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had
your pick, would you

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:84%
be a walk-in, a
starseed, or a hybrid.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, I love being
a walk-in, I have to say.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:90%
But I am a starseeded walk-in.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
in some way we all

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:84%
have hybridized bodies
in some form or fashion.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So being a walk-in, honestly,
has totally changed my life.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:90%
It's been for the better.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I have such a desire to
be in service to humanity

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and to really be a conduit
to allow that energy

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:84%
to flow through, to help
an individual or groups.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say,
has being a walk-in helped you

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:90%
or helped society?

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, I
think probably both.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I do know that this body
was very, very sick prior

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:90%
to my coming into it.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So the walk-in's frequency
helped to heal this body.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
As far as being in
service, I think

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I am in service
individually to people

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:84%
when I'm providing healing
sessions or counseling sessions,

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:84%
as well as to groups, because
I also work with groups.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think,
Sheila of ET disclosure.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to happen?

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, ET disclosure
is happening already.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Many people are bringing
through this disclosure.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
The internet is
full of photographs

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:90%
that individuals have taken.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about
it on a government basis,

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that
will come a little bit

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:48.820 align:middle line:84%
slower so that they can help
to prepare the population.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a mission
of walk-ins, starseeds,

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:90%
and hybrids?

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Yes.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that mission?

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: So most of the walk-ins
that come in to be a wayshower

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and to help humanity to work
through any collective energies

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that they may have stored
in their holographic field

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to help them with forgiveness,
also to help to raise

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:90%
their vibrational frequency.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Starseeds also come in with
a very similar mission,

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and they also work very
deeply with the planet

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:90%
as well as with all the animals.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:90%
And then the hybrids come in.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:84%
They really are here
to serve as a bridge

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and to serve as a welcoming
committee, if you will,

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:90%
for the galactics to come in.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barbara
Lamb is with us again

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to talk about walk-ins,
starseeds and hybrids.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.150 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: This book,
Cosmic Convergence,

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:10%
is wonderful in
letting people know

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:10%
about so many different
kinds of people, beings,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:10%
consciousness that there
are living amongst us

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:10%
and that there is
really a force for good.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
The walk-ins, the
starseeds, and the hybrids

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:84%
are all here to
really give service,

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:84%
to be helpful to humanity and
to bring knowledge, wisdom,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
awareness of all of these higher
other dimensions of reality.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think it is really
extremely important

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to know that in addition
to all the things going

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
on in the world, which
we're mostly aware of,

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:84%
that there are other
beings of various types

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:84%
who are not originally
from here but who

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
have made the effort to
come here one way or another

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
as a walk-in, born
here as a starseed,

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:84%
or born here as a hybrid
to really bring information

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:84%
to us from a higher
realm, to bring

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:90%
goodness and helpfulness to us.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So these three
types of beings, who

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:84%
are living right amongst
us all over the world,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:29.140 align:middle line:84%
are really expanding
our awareness of reality

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and the goodness that is
out there and can be ours.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these visitations
of walk-ins, starseeds,

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and hybrids happening
throughout the universe,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.540 align:middle line:84%
or just on good
old planet Earth?

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, right
now, we know for sure

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:84%
that they're here
on planet Earth.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Starseeds, of course, are
spread all throughout the galaxy

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:57.680 align:middle line:84%
because starseeds are
souls from other planets.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And I am sure that there
are other types of hybrids

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:84%
as well, because
many of the hybrids

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
will choose to stay
aboard the craft.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:84%
They may become
pilots of the craft.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.320 align:middle line:84%
They may become emissaries,
or they may become diplomats

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:90%
or be parts of councils.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So we do know that walk-ins,
starseeds, and hybrids are

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:90%
everywhere within our galaxy.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila, what
does a hybrid look like?

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, a hybrid
can look just like us.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times they will
have characteristics

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:90%
that you might be drawn to.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Like, their eyes may
be a little bit larger.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:84%
They may have a
unique skin tone.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen hybrids that
when they're out in the sun,

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:84%
they kind of glisten
just a little bit.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So a hybrid is truly designed
so that they fit in to society,

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
because it's not so much that
people understand that they're

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
a hybrid as they understand the
information and their ability

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:84%
to serve as that bridge
with the galactics.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So does a hybrid
know they're a hybrid?

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Many do, yes.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure that there
are some that do not,

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:84%
just as some walk-ins don't
know that they're walk-ins,

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:84%
or starseeds have
not yet awakened.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
totally cured now?

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Of the illnesses?

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:90%
I was instantaneously healed.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Miracle?

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: I would say so.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
spiritual, these walk-ins?

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: The ones that
I know, absolutely.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.800 align:middle line:10%
One of the concerns
that I had when I first

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:10%
entered into the
body, because I really

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:10%
didn't know a lot
about walk-ins,

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:10%
was that I was a body snatcher.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And working with
my Collective, they

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:84%
helped me to
understand that there

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:90%
has to be a pre-birth plan.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:84%
There has to be an
agreement with the soul

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and the body for a walk-in
to be able to enter.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So that really put
my mind at ease.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
there's a misconception

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that people think that it's
a possession of some type.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, possessions typically
involve lower vibrating entities

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:84%
entering into the
field of the person

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
or actually penetrating
into the body of the person

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:90%
without their permission.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Walk-ins always arrive
with permission.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's not like
you're being possessed?

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: No.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Not at all, not at all.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Vibrations is what
dictates that.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Any type of a possession is
a very low vibrational state.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:84%
When walk-ins
arrive, they actually

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:84%
have a higher vibration
within their soul energy

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.008 align:middle line:90%
than the soul that left.

00:24:48.008 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila, if
you told a priest

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:84%
you're a walk-in, that
you had another soul,

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and the old one walked out,
what do you think he would say?

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, it depends on
how open the priest would be.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's very
difficult for walk-ins

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
to share their stories
because there's

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.770 align:middle line:90%
a great deal of skepticism.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, people think that
walk-ins are delusional.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.390 align:middle line:84%
They think that walk-ins
have had psychotic breaks.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:84%
They think that walk-ins are
some type of a possession.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And I went through
all of those ideas

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
myself when I was learning
more about who I am.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So when I had my mind put at
ease, anytime someone talks

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
to me about it, I'm very
open, and I share with them

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:90%
what I know.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that
my story has never

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
changed since I've
entered into the body.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Through the help
of Barbara Lamb,

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:84%
with hypnosis, I have
learned a little bit more

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:90%
and been able to expand.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I came
here with a higher purpose.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
galactic federation?

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: There are
galactic federations.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there are.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they trying to do?

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, it depends
on who you talk to.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So with the galactic
federations that I am aware of,

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:84%
they are very positive
nature and they're

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.850 align:middle line:84%
made up of representatives
from different star systems.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
They are made up
of representatives

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:90%
from different planets.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And soon, we hope
that planet Earth

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.600 align:middle line:84%
will be able to join
that because we will

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
have met our galactic families
and embrace the fact that we too

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:90%
are from the stars.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That brings
us up to Barbara Lamb

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:84%
talking again about
galactic beings

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and how they help
us on this planet.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:41.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: Galactic beings give
a lot of messages to humanity,

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:10%
and very often they give
them through the walk-ins

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:10%
and the starseeds
and the hybrids.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Their messages are
always very benevolent.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:84%
They are very caring
about humanity.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
They want humanity to
wake up and realize

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of this
universal cosmic community,

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
even though most human beings do
not think of ourselves that way.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So they want us to
be aware of them

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and that there are millions
of planets out there

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that have very conscious,
intelligent life,

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and that we would do very well
if we would be aware of them

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and want to be more
like them in the sense

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:90%
of an enlightened consciousness.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Human beings tend to be
very, very focused on what's

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:90%
going on here on Earth.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there is a lot
going on here on Earth.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.910 align:middle line:84%
But the picture is so
much bigger than that.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So these beings
out there in space

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:84%
would like us to really
wake up and realize

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that we're actually
part of an incredibly

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:90%
enormous galactic community.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:84%
They would like us to
evolve in our consciousness

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:15.370 align:middle line:84%
to be more kind and
benevolent to each other

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:20.040 align:middle line:84%
or to work things out well
together, to cooperate,

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:26.610 align:middle line:84%
not to be over and against
each other in really any way.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So they are really
trying to evolve

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness of humanity.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
the galactic community

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:90%
think about us, Sheila?

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, the
galactic community

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.380 align:middle line:84%
has been here for
many, many years,

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
even possibly since humans
were here on the planet,

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.920 align:middle line:84%
kind of watching over
us and overseeing.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's only so much that
they can do from up there.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's one reason why there
is a walk-in program, because I

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.360 align:middle line:90%
am like boots on the ground.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I can talk face to face with you
and articulate some of the ideas

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.800 align:middle line:90%
that they share with me.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in God?

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Absolutely.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they?

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Absolutely, yes.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:84%
My understanding-- and that was
one of the very first questions

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:90%
that I asked my Collective--

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:22.220 align:middle line:84%
was, where exactly
did we come from?

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And as I was explained, there
is the energy of the source.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Some people call that
God, Father, Mother, God,

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
prime source, creator,
the divine one.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.210 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many names
that this energy goes by.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And when this energy
desired to know itself,

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.860 align:middle line:84%
then these thought
forms began to create.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
just thought forms.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.610 align:middle line:90%
They began to serve templates.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And within these
templates were blueprints.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of those blueprints
is what was for our souls.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we had
the unfolding that

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.750 align:middle line:84%
began to occur in
the form of what's

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.190 align:middle line:90%
called the Master Oversoul.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
The Master Oversoul is not
just for humanity's oversoul.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
It is for all of our galactic
brothers and sisters.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So we all are souls
having various experiences

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.940 align:middle line:84%
for the edification and
the ability for source

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:23.010 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand what
it's like to be the created.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So from that master
oversoul, then there

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.060 align:middle line:84%
are vibrations that
begin to occur that start

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:84%
to come together that create
what we call the soul families.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And within the soul
families, of course,

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.030 align:middle line:84%
as they begin to come
together, they're soul groups.

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
But they're made up of
individual oversouls,

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:84%
or what we would call
the primary oversoul.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's say this is the oversoul.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Each oversoul can be
having a multitude

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:90%
of experiences all at one time.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what creates
the multiple lifetimes,

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.660 align:middle line:90%
the multidimensionality.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So as this begins
to incarnate, this

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:84%
would be called
the Sheantiaskaan.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And within the
Sheantiaskaan, it's

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.430 align:middle line:84%
kind of a miniature
cloud storage.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And it has all
the choice points.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:90%
It has all the information.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It has everything that we
need for the spiritual bodies.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:84%
It has what we
need to connect in

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.370 align:middle line:90%
with all the cosmic templates.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It has that individual higher
self stream that comes in.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And then as that
higher self stream

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:84%
attaches to the
physical form, that's

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:84%
called the soul or the
personality of the lifetime.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So when we are having an
individual experience,

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
we can be having
many other lifetimes.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when we
experience what a lot of people

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:84%
call deja vu,
that's actually when

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:84%
we're having a resonant
frequency match with one

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:90%
of our other Sheantiaskaans.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that resonant
match is in a multiple lifetime.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:84%
It could be in a
parallel lifetime.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It could even be
on another planet.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you didn't
have this walk-in occur,

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.870 align:middle line:90%
would you be dead by now?

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: I would be.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:90%
I would be.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So the walk-in not
only allowed this body

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.750 align:middle line:84%
to continue its
animation, it was

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.020 align:middle line:84%
able to then help raise the
children, which are very special

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.530 align:middle line:90%
in and of their own rights.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you channel
as well, don't you?

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Yes.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who do you channel?

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: I channel Tiamu.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:39.840 align:middle line:90%
And Tiamu came to me-- actually.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Tiamu helped inspire
the writing of the book.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But Tiamu is part
of my Collective,

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and she identified herself as
an Elder Mother Andromedan.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she was
a future aspect of me,

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:84%
still as part of my Collective,
because collectives operate

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
in multiple timelines
outside, actually, of time,

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:06.470 align:middle line:84%
but they operate in a different
dimension, different densities.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So Tiamu began to come to
me through Light Language.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up one morning and
I was speaking Light Language,

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:90%
and I could not stop.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.540 align:middle line:84%
All morning I was
speaking Light Language.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.880 align:middle line:84%
In the shower, I was
speaking Light Language.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like,
what is going on?

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:90%
And then I heard the voice.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I am Tiamu.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I am an elder mother
from Andromeda.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:90%
I am a future aspect of you.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She found
you or you found her?

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, we are
all one in the same.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:84%
So it was an aspect of
myself that woke up.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
channel her at will?

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Yes.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you do that now?

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Sure.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'll ask her
questions about the universe.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:90%
How do you get into your mode?

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: So she will first come
in by speaking Light Language.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And I would be what's called
a conscious channel, unless I

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.790 align:middle line:84%
really go deep into
the Light Language

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and then I just
kind of lose myself

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.650 align:middle line:90%
and give myself over to that.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:84%
But for the purpose
of asking questions,

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:15.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll remain a conscious channel.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But she will come in
through Light Language,

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.570 align:middle line:90%
so we'll just welcome her in.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:90%


00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So she's happy to
be here, and she's

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:90%
ready to answer your questions.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
aware what she says--

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Yes.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:37.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --in your
physical body?

00:34:37.705 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Yes.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.379 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I can get back
to you at any time I want?

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.179 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Yes.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:90%
It'll just take a second.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tiamu, what
planet are you from?

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Andromeda.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.179 align:middle line:90%
I am from actually a biosphere.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:55.000 align:middle line:84%
The Andromedan planet that
I was on has long been gone.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And we have been for many,
many years on a biosphere.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It looks as if a planet,
as if it were a planet,

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.700 align:middle line:84%
but we move throughout
space and time.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is your creator?

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: My creator is the
Prime Source, the same as yours.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about the Big Bang,

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.010 align:middle line:84%
because nobody can
explain it to me.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: The Big
Bang is what we know

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.020 align:middle line:84%
is when we had all
of the molecules,

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:84%
we had everything necessary
for life to come together

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:32.460 align:middle line:84%
in an explosion that began
to expand throughout what

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.420 align:middle line:90%
we call time-space.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And this then began
to form universes.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It actually is, as we
were talking earlier,

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:84%
it was one of the templates
of creation that unfolded.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And the Big Bang is
not just the only one.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:84%
There are many other
universes as we know them.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could something
start from nothing?

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, the Prime
Source has always been.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were talking
to a group of physics experts,

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.470 align:middle line:84%
what would you tell them
about this universe?

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Well, the universe is
varied in all the life forms.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds
of thousands, if not

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:16.140 align:middle line:84%
millions, of life forms
that are out there.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.930 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
planets that have life.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.640 align:middle line:90%
There are moons that have life.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.750 align:middle line:84%
There are stars and even
suns that have life on them.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
lives are conscious.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of them may be
not what you would

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.420 align:middle line:90%
think of as a humanoid species.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.120 align:middle line:90%
They may be more like the wind.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:84%
They may be more like
the water droplets.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And they may be more
like geometric shapes.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have an opportunity
to talk to the human race

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.510 align:middle line:84%
What would you
like them to know?

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: We would
like them to know

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:58.160 align:middle line:84%
that forgiveness and love is
the prime need on this planet

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.720 align:middle line:84%
right now, and that if
people could drop deep

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.470 align:middle line:84%
within themselves, begin to
heal their own soul wounds,

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.450 align:middle line:84%
allow love to flow
through, this planet would

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:90%
raise in its vibration.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And when the planet
raises in the vibration,

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.170 align:middle line:84%
there is a ripple
that is occurring

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:21.110 align:middle line:84%
from each and every human that
helps to raise this frequency.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And as the frequency raises, it
can actually move into a higher

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:32.140 align:middle line:84%
state into a 5D, a
6D, even a 7D planet.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tiamu, do you know
much about planet Earth?

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: Particularly, what
would you like to know?

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it so
warring and hateful?

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: This is a planet
that is made of duality,

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and it is here that
people come to experience

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.190 align:middle line:90%
the good and the bad.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And although war is a
very terrible thing that

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.780 align:middle line:84%
occurs on this planet,
it is something

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that is part of the
makeup of humanity

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.760 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
experience forgiveness, so

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that you can
experience compassion,

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:15.070 align:middle line:84%
so that you can experience
what it is like to reach out

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.480 align:middle line:90%
to those that are in need.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
If you have a planet
that is only love, which

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.670 align:middle line:84%
this planet can become, you
do not have these things.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.750 align:middle line:90%
You do not have war.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:28.190 align:middle line:90%
You do not have poverty.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.870 align:middle line:90%
You do not have hunger.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:33.130 align:middle line:84%
But humanity has not
yet reached that state

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:84%
that they do not need
these things to grow.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does the
soul mean to you, Tiamu?

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: A soul is a
source consciousness unit,

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and a soul continues to grow.

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:50.090 align:middle line:90%
A soul continues to expand.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:84%
When I came into
being, I started out

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:90%
in the Andromedan system.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:39:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But the planet, as I said that
we were on, is no longer there.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So within our lifetimes,
there are so much longer

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:07.300 align:middle line:84%
than they are here
with the human species.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But I too have
chosen to incarnate

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.490 align:middle line:90%
and have other experiences.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I have experienced what it's
like to be an Arcturian.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And after that cycle
was over, I came back

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.250 align:middle line:90%
to be an Andromedan again.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:25.900 align:middle line:84%
You right now are experiencing
what it's like to be a human.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And you will go back
and see what it's

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:31.330 align:middle line:90%
like to be an Arcturian again.

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
find Sheila, the body

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.620 align:middle line:90%
you're talking through?

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: We are all
part of the same.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.270 align:middle line:90%
The body is the vessel.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The body is what allows us
to have the human experience.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:84%
The body and the
brain is what allows

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:53.350 align:middle line:84%
us to have all of the various
senses that we experience.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But what we know
of as Sheila came--

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:58.650 align:middle line:90%
this was the body.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And Sheila, as you
know her now, was

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.110 align:middle line:90%
part of the collective energy.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And she is a source
consciousness,

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.110 align:middle line:84%
or she is the consciousness unit
that comes from The Collective.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And we all are part of
the source consciousness.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of Sheila?

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: I think
that she's here doing

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.350 align:middle line:84%
the work that The Collective
has sent her to do.

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is
she doing it well?

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: She is
doing it very well.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:30.290 align:middle line:84%
What final words would
you have for all of us?

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: To realize that you are
so much more than you have been

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:39.350 align:middle line:84%
told that you are, that you
are greater beyond anything

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.550 align:middle line:90%
that you could possibly imagine.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:46.020 align:middle line:84%
You have that divine source
consciousness within you.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:84%
You are very, very
powerful co-creators.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And as such, be careful
with that which you create.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we welcome
to join the space race?

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Absolutely.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.760 align:middle line:90%
And it will be wonderful.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter of
time before the human race

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.440 align:middle line:84%
is ready to acknowledge
and to become part

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.705 align:middle line:90%
of the galactic civilizations.

00:41:10.705 --> 00:41:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we're
not there yet?

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: We are almost there.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.600 align:middle line:84%
There are many timelines
right now at play.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And within a timeline, you
have to look at that as it is

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.940 align:middle line:90%
a field of all possibilities.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And wherever humanity is
placing its intention,

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.290 align:middle line:84%
it begins to weigh
that timeline down.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And as the timeline weighs down
with all of this intention,

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.650 align:middle line:84%
the likelihood of it
occurring will happen.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you, Tiamu.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: It is my pleasure.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sheila, come back.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Are you there?

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: I am here.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
you think of that?

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: I love Tiamu.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I love her energy
as it flows through.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because
as I hear her talk,

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the things
that she says

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.960 align:middle line:84%
are things that I talk
with my clients about.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the things
that she says

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.920 align:middle line:84%
are things that I know
within me to be true,

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and it just verifies
and confirms to me

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:14.130 align:middle line:84%
more and more every day that
we are one and the same.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think is the greatest

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
message you personally
could give to humans?

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: I think it's very
similar to what Tiamu says,

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:26.200 align:middle line:84%
that we are all so
much greater than we

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.040 align:middle line:90%
have been told that we are.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I work with
people, I really

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.770 align:middle line:84%
try to get them to acknowledge
and to embrace that soul

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:39.850 align:middle line:84%
aspect that they are everything
that I do, whether it's

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.470 align:middle line:84%
my healing work with
spirit way, wellness,

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:47.290 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm talking with clients
as Sheila Seppi, whatever that

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.070 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I have to back up and say early
on, my group came to me and they

00:42:55.380 --> 00:43:00.300 align:middle line:84%
said, people cannot drop into
the essence of who they truly

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.900 align:middle line:90%
are when they're in pain.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:07.380 align:middle line:84%
They cannot embrace the joy
that the soul has to offer when

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.760 align:middle line:90%
they're in pain.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I also provide
healing services because I want

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.950 align:middle line:84%
to get people out of
pain so they can drop in

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:90%
and embrace who they are.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila,
what do doctors say

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:23.640 align:middle line:90%
about your miraculous change?

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: They basically
patted me on the back

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.637 align:middle line:84%
and said their medicine
did a great job.

00:43:28.637 --> 00:43:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
taking credit for it?

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: They did.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.700 align:middle line:84%
They took credit,
which was OK with me

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.555 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
know any different.

00:43:34.555 --> 00:43:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
tell them what you did?

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: No.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.470 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] No, I don't think
that they would have accepted

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:42.780 align:middle line:84%
it because at that
time, it was very hard

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:84%
for me to even conceive that
such a thing could happen.

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
next step for humanity?

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: The next
step for humanity

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:84%
is moving into these
higher-dimensional frequencies.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And we are already doing
that, because a lot of people

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.990 align:middle line:84%
are starting to raise
their vibration,

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:08.030 align:middle line:84%
because they're learning how
to drop into the essence of who

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.260 align:middle line:90%
they are at a soul level.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.710 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing
in and anchoring

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:15.870 align:middle line:90%
in more of their higher selves.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.700 align:middle line:84%
They're even going up
into their own oversouls

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and being able to pull down
some of the angelic essences,

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.600 align:middle line:90%
or to bring in more of their--

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it
galactic family,

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.470 align:middle line:84%
but most people say they're
extraterrestrial essences.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So humanity is already beginning
to shift and to change.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is truly remarkable.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Is there a great future for us?

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SEPPI: There
definitely can be.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.620 align:middle line:90%
There are many timelines.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And the timeline that is
the most promising right

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:53.600 align:middle line:84%
now that I am aware of is what
people call the inscension.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the book, I talk a
great deal about the inscension.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And I started earlier
talking about source and then

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:08.110 align:middle line:84%
how source came in and
had the master oversoul,

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and then the soul families all
the way down to the soul that

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:12.770 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:17.680 align:middle line:84%
That is the inscension process,
bringing in those higher

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.040 align:middle line:90%
dimensional energies.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And as each human, as each
individual begins to grow,

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:29.120 align:middle line:84%
they can anchor more of that
higher frequency within them.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And as they do that,
then the ascension

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:36.140 align:middle line:84%
is that transformational
process.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it is believed that this
planet used to be a 5D planet

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:47.920 align:middle line:84%
already, and then it was lowered
into the 3D for a variety

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.170 align:middle line:84%
of reasons, one,
with the polarity.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:56.110 align:middle line:10%
But we now are in that process
that humanity, by and large,

00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:00.680 align:middle line:10%
has experienced and
had this 3D experience.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're ready to now
move into something higher.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But because we have time, we
could say that we're already

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.773 align:middle line:84%
in 4D, and we're getting
ready to move into 5D.

00:46:11.773 --> 00:46:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila, where
do people get your book

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Cosmic Convergence?

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.110 align:middle line:10%
>>SEPPI: Well, they can go to
my website, sheilaseppi.com.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.770 align:middle line:10%
They can go to Amazon,
and they can find it

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:22.920 align:middle line:10%
in a variety of bookstores.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila, Thanks for
being on Beyond Belief and thank

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.687 align:middle line:90%
Barbara Lamb for us.

00:46:26.687 --> 00:46:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SEPPI: Absolutely.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.148 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for the
opportunity to be here.

00:46:30.148 --> 00:46:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you ever come
across a walk-in, a starseed,

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:37.030 align:middle line:84%
or a hybrid, you'll realize that
they are very special people

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.260 align:middle line:90%
and they're looking out for you.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
