00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.993 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:12.554 align:middle line:84%
>> People basically are going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.781 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.525 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a
fascinating program for you

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.560 align:middle line:84%
today, as we talk
about Biblical prophecy

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and just what's going to
happen to us in the future.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest, of
course, Paul McGuire.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.890 align:middle line:84%
He is a professor
at King's College.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
He is an expert
on Bible prophecy,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
current events,
and things that are

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to us
that will make you cringe.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:90%
Paul, welcome to the program.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.806 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL MCGUIRE:
George, great to be on.

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did you get
interested in Biblical

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:90%
prophecy?

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, let me start
by saying I hated Biblical

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:90%
prophecy and I hated the Bible.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Truly, when I was
a kid and when I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.204 align:middle line:84%
was in college-- last book
in the world I would read.

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You didn't get
it as a kid, did you?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: No, didn't
get it in college, either.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.283 align:middle line:84%
I hated Christians, thought
it was a religion for morons.

00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:90%
But then I began to read it.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I really
began to read it,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that the
Bible-- the Old Testament

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and New Testament-- isn't
just some archaic language.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
It deals with DNA,
holographs, digital reality,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
virtual worlds,
all kinds of stuff.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you get that,
the book becomes alive.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was
like you as a kid.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hate it, but
I wanted to learn it,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to read it.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
reading the Bible,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
specifically Genesis,
I was fascinated by it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I was trying to figure
out what does it really mean?

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking
about fallen angels?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about
extraterrestrials?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And what did they see,
what did they witness,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:84%
in order to write these
stories like that?

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.490 align:middle line:90%
I got hooked that way.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Much like you, nonreligious
when it came to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
that-- I was raised a
Catholic, but I really

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:84%
wanted to just dive
into what did it mean.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the book of Revelation
was fascinating for me.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.307 align:middle line:90%
I was hooked after that.

00:02:25.307 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, yeah
that's what happened to me.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
that the story of Noah

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
was not the story of some
funky old man with a beard

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and a cute boat with
all these animals,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I realized that it was a DNA
holographic digital story,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and that the reason
for the flood

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
was that God was
judging global planetary

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.830 align:middle line:84%
corruption of the DNA, and
that the purpose of the ark

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.950 align:middle line:84%
was to take the animals and
the human beings that did not

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
have the corrupted DNA
and replenish the earth.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:84%
But as you know, George,
the big secret-- and that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:84%
makes the whole
thing explode-- is

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
that the DNA that
God was wiping out

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
was inter-dimensional being
that mated with human women.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's mind-blowing.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.955 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:84%
As they said in
Genesis-- and I found

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
that, as an adult reading
it again, I'm going,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:90%
how can this be?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:84%
How can these
inter-dimensional beings

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:84%
be mating with humans,
creating these offspring?

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
really happened?

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Interpret this for me,
based on your perception.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, let me
say this really briefly.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:84%
When you flip over the back of
your dollar, there's a phoenix.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a symbol.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Phoenicia,
where Mount Hermon was,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
there was a descent,
from another dimension,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of
inter-dimensional beings

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:90%
to Mount Hermon in Phoenicia.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:84%
They mated with human
women, producing

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:84%
a hybrid species
called the Nephilim.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:90%
And they were the star children.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:90%
They were the God-men.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:84%
They were the people
that caused Atlantis

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:90%
to be a super civilization.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:90%
And so it gets so intense.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to
the Tower of Babel,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that the Tower
of Babel and Babylon, which

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:84%
is literally translated
"gate of the gods,"

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Babylon and the Tower
of Babel is a stargate.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.992 align:middle line:84%
It's an in inter-dimensional
portal to bring in these beings

00:04:37.992 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:90%
from another dimension.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
how they got here.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.923 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:04:40.923 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And one day
we'll truly figure it out.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
We're getting close, I
think, scientifically,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to understanding about
these portals and stargates.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe wormholes
might be part of those.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, you're right.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
The Bible seems to be
so sometimes archaic.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But because our science
has exponentially grown--

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
we're into quantum physics
and skalar technology

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:90%
and string theory and stuff.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden these
ambiguous passages,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
they open up in light of
modern science and physics.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So a couple weeks ago,
I'm dealing with my credit card

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:90%
on the phone, right.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And everything's touch-tone
and punch in, right.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So they said, please
punch in the first three

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:90%
letters of your last name.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm looking at the phone,
and I'm going, oh my gosh-

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:90%
6, 6, 6.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I said I'm the anti-Christ.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.754 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Yeah,
how could it be?

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This sign of the
beast, this 666, what is that?

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, what's
fascinating about that,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
is that that prediction, made
by John when he had the vision

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Revelation, talks
about the mark of the beast--

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:90%
666.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
That was written,
what, 2000 years ago?

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And we now have nanochip,
biochip, microchip technology,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:84%
which carries identity,
and can handle

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:84%
commerce and financial
transactions.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And in Revelation, Chapter
11, and Revelation 13,

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
we read about this
global economic system,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:84%
which incorporates this "mark
of the beast" technology.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Who would've thought
that John could

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:90%
have seen this 2000 years ago?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So we are moving into
an integrated world,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.310 align:middle line:90%
where it's a cashless society.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:84%
But more than that, all
monetary transactions

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:90%
will be done with a chip.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Now the Bible talks about this.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: And we're
going that way fast.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: We're here.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.209 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: People are
holding back-- some people--

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
but they're forcing
us, piece by piece.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I had a story on Coast
to Coast-- biometrics,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:84%
where they'll put a
chip in your palm.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.306 align:middle line:90%
You won't need your credit card.

00:07:05.306 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything will be
connected to your checking

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:90%
account at your bank.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.886 align:middle line:84%
All you do is just walk by
the scanner, and go [BEEP].

00:07:11.886 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And they take the
money out of whatever

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:84%
account you've designated,
and you're done.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.451 align:middle line:90%
That's frightening.

00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: It is frightening.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that's interesting,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
it talks about in the
Book of Revelation that,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:84%
in order to get quote,
"the mark of the beast,"

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:84%
you have to pledge
allegiance to what

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:90%
the Bible calls the Antichrist.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So that-- that implies some
kind of virtual control

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:90%
mechanism in the technology.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you analyze computer
technology, and the computer

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.510 align:middle line:84%
brain interfaces,
and the world brain,

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
you can monitor
people's brain waves.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:90%
You know what they're thinking.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
You know whether they're
compliant or rebellious.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
compliant, then you get

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:84%
to participate in the
global economic system.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:84%
But even if you don't
vocalize your rebellion,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:84%
the microchip can
read your brain waves,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:84%
transmit it to a
global brain, and you

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.232 align:middle line:84%
get booted out of
buying and selling.

00:08:15.232 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Which is exactly what
they said in the Bible--

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that if you don't basically
move into this system,

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
you won't be able
to buy or sell.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's right there
for you to see.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: And again, who
would've ever thought that they

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.758 align:middle line:84%
would have understood
that 2000 years ago?

00:08:35.758 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:84%
And I get people saying
to me all the time, well,

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:90%
it literally means tattoo.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:90%
That's irrelevant.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Because as you know, tattoos
now have computer technology

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.420 align:middle line:90%
embedded in the tattoos.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter
whether it's a tattoo

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:84%
or it's a nanochip
implant, which

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:84%
could be a molecular microchip
implant in the bloodstream.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's microscopic.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Originally I had
thought that the social

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:84%
security numbers that we all
have might have been the sign

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:90%
of the beast.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Because you need it to work.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
You really need it to
get by in this society.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:90%
But I grew out of that.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Did you think that way, too,
that maybe the social security

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:90%
number they gave us was that?

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Because they forced
us to take one.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Without one you don't work.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And now when you're a
baby-- babies are born,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.340 align:middle line:90%
they get 'em right away.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: I think it
was a early warning.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to make
a political statement here,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:84%
because if you do
the research, it

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
goes into both
Republican and Democrat.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
But in all this
health care technology

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:84%
that goes back even before
Obama, in the language,

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:84%
there's a medchip, which
I believe the medchip

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
is a snap of a fingers away
from the microchip implant.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So you get a medchip,
but that could

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:84%
be activated to be
a microchip implant.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.704 align:middle line:84%
And I personally believe
that there's a lot--

00:10:07.704 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to scare people,
but I think there is--

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Aww, scare 'em, Paul.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.496 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: All right.

00:10:12.496 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's millions of
people in the United States

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:84%
who have nanochip
implants inside of them

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.767 align:middle line:84%
already, through various
means of getting them.

00:10:20.767 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they
don't even know it.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: They
don't even know it.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they're not
activated yet, or whatever.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But those nanochip implants
are in their bodies.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.786 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Through
maybe vaccines?

00:10:29.786 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Vaccines,
yeah, absolutely.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying you
shouldn't give your kids,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:90%
at a certain age, a vaccine.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.319 align:middle line:84%
But I don't run around
getting unnecessary vaccines.

00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:41.235 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't want--

00:10:41.235 --> 00:10:42.943 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I
don't get the flu shot.

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And I clearly tell people,
this is your decision.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not telling you to get it.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not telling
you not to get it.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:90%
That's up to you.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm just telling you what I do.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had the
flu, and I don't

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.317 align:middle line:84%
think I can remember
if I ever had the flu.

00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Me, too.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I do antioxidants.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:90%
I do nutrition.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I'm going to
get a needle stuck in me.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Because the person
giving me the shot

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.589 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know if there's
a nanochip implant.

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And even if there's
not a nanochip implant,

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't want my DNA rewired.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's
bad enough for me,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:84%
as a kid growing up in the
'50s, that the polio vaccine had

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:90%
the simian monkey virus in it.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And God knows what's
in my system, as a kid.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So I try
not to do that.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
This process of
microchipping people,

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually
saying, look,

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
this is how we're going
to conduct commerce.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
make money anymore.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to avoid
counterfeiting.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:84%
They aren't going to
use excuses like that.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:90%
We need to stop counterfeiting.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:84%
The new $100 bill, which
is very strange looking--

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Very strange.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was-- a friend of
mine runs a casino in Saint

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Louis.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And he came up to me
and said, you know,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
we just got visited
by the Secret

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Service a couple days ago.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.364 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, why?

00:12:03.364 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:90%
You're a casino.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I assume it's
counterfeit money, right?

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's the
new bills already,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
counterfeited probably
in China, they think.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is supposed
to be fail-safe.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
There's not supposed to be
any counterfeiting with this.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
It's already happening.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So one day, they're
going to say to us, hey,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:90%
we have to stop this.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:84%
The only way to do
this is no cash.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
to get this chip.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Now what do we do, as
individuals, when you're

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:84%
forced to either/or--
and if you don't take it,

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:90%
you can't pump gasoline.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't hold your
hand up to the screen.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.876 align:middle line:90%
What do we do, Paul?

00:12:44.876 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well this is a very,
very, very important question.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And I deal with it in
my book, A Prophecy

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Future of
America, because it's

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:84%
a question I get
asked all the time.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Technically, if you get a
microchip implant or a nanochip

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:84%
implant-- which I
don't advise getting--

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:84%
but technically that's
not related to quote,

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
"the mark of the
beast" necessarily.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:84%
In order for it to become
the mark of the beast,

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:84%
or to be activated to be
the mark of the beast,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to renounce any
personal faith you have in God.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:90%
You renounce your faith in God.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, almost
a ceremonial thing.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you pledge to
worship this Antichrist.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.429 align:middle line:90%
At that moment--

00:13:29.429 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Then you're in.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: You're in.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And if you protest,
who knows what they're going

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:90%
to do you, right?

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, the Bible's
very specific if you protest.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:84%
The actual mechanism of
death is very specifically

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:90%
outlined in the scripture.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:90%
It's beheading.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:90%
That was written 2000 years ago.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.499 align:middle line:84%
But if you reject the mark of
the beast, you are beheaded.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just like that.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.665 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Just like that.

00:13:54.665 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's hope to
God we never get to that.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yeah, right.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: My gosh.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
society will we have

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
when they get to that
point that say, you know,

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:84%
you've got to honor the
Antichrist-- they're not

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.780 align:middle line:84%
going to say it's the
Antichrist, of course.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:90%
You've got to get your chip.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And are they actually going
to say, if you refuse,

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get beheaded?

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Or do they, like, capture you?

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.777 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:14:19.777 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: I don't know
how it's going to happen,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.214 align:middle line:84%
whether it's behind
closed doors or publicly.

00:14:24.214 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think of
The Hunger Games.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they going
to round people up?

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: The Hunger Games
is a sci-fi fantasy movie,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.997 align:middle line:90%
but there's some pretty heavy--

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Reality to that.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yeah, right.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So I could see us going
into that kind of future.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think people need
to realize, especially

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:84%
as Americans, we
have a very-- I know

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a
culture like that.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:84%
We have a very naive
view about reality.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
We all think that
people think like we do,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have conscience,
and we have right and wrong.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, I
know from my research,

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:84%
that there are people at
the very highest levels

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:84%
of our world who
have no conscience.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.204 align:middle line:84%
They believe that they
are genetically superior--

00:15:09.204 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's true.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: --that
they are God-men,

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and that we're disposal.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So they would kill us,
with not a second thought.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We're in their way.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: We're in their way.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And they have no conflict,
morally, whatsoever.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.872 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even take
a moment's hesitation.

00:15:28.872 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I want to go through
a few of the images that you

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:90%
supplied for us, of course.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're a strong
believer, Paul,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:84%
that the dollar is going to
go away as the world currency,

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and something else
will replace it.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Yeah the dollar is
being deliberately devalued.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Soros talked about
this openly on the BBC

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:90%
before millions of Europeans.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So the dollar has to
be devalued in order

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.770 align:middle line:90%
to bring in a global currency.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And the reason the
dollar has to be devalued

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.790 align:middle line:84%
is, if the dollar is a
superior-value currency,

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.020 align:middle line:84%
everybody's going to
want to hold onto it.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you crash the
dollar, and you equalize it

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
to all the other
world currencies, then

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:90%
it becomes irrelevant.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So you remove the
dollar, and then you

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:90%
convert to a world currency.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're on the very
precipice of seeing that world

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
currency conversion
happening now.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, Soros and others in
the British media, as you know,

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:84%
have openly called
for what they call

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
a new international
economic order.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And we are moving
very quickly into

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:84%
that new international
economic order.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you see
that the 10 years out?

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: No, I see I
we are moving into the new

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle line:84%
international
economic order now.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's happening in
this country economically since

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:90%
2008?

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
The bumps in the road, I
think, were deliberately

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.190 align:middle line:84%
set up to get us
into this position

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:90%
that you just mentioned.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Absolutely,
because it's all happening

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a convergence,
economically,

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.200 align:middle line:90%
and there's an acceleration.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
So on one hand, we see
the dollar being devalued.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
we see nations

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:84%
like China and Australia
trading among themselves,

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.119 align:middle line:90%
in their own currency.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
We see Iran, Russia, trading
in their own currencies.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:84%
The dollar is no longer the
de facto world currency.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And so, at a certain point,
the international bankers--

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
the guys who really control
the global economic system--

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:84%
they've wanted this
for a long time.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
They're going to move in
with their global currency.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is is that
Americans and Europeans

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and other people, when you trade
in what's left of your dollar

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
for this global
currency, you're going

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to get a small percentage
of the worth of your dollar,

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.325 align:middle line:84%
as you convert it into
a global currency.

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you're going
to lose money, basically.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.589 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: You're going
to lose money big time.

00:17:59.589 --> 00:18:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you've got $50,000
in the bank, and you convert,

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.784 align:middle line:90%
maybe you'll get, what $20,000?

00:18:03.784 --> 00:18:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: If you're lucky.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.427 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In usable money.

00:18:06.427 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Because the goal is
to get rid of the middle class.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well,
why would anybody

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.009 align:middle line:84%
want to get rid of
the middle class?

00:18:16.009 --> 00:18:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the American
middle class is unique.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And strong.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: And strong--
so it's a problem.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So again, you have people--
it's very hard for Americans

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:90%
to grasp this.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
You think of the back
of the US dollar.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And you have that
occult pyramid there.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And it is an occult pyramid.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And in case somebody doubts
that it's an occult pyramid,

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
then you simply
ask, well, why does

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid on the
back of the US dollar

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:84%
have the all-seeing
eye of Lucifer on it,

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:84%
if it's not in an
occult pyramid?

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Number two, why
does it say the words "new world

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
order" on the base of the
pyramid, translated from Latin,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:90%
"nuvus ordo seclorum"?

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So it says right there on
the back of the dollar bill

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that we really live in a
hierarchical global political

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And how old is that?

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It's been around a
long time, hasn't it?

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: It goes
back to the pharaoh,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of the
pharaoh god-kings.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:90%
And this is essential to grasp.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the pharaoh
god-king concept is

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
they really believed that
the pharaoh was a god.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.460 align:middle line:90%
And there's a reason for that.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Before the flood,
you had Atlantis.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was ruled
by 10 god-kings.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Now how do we know that?

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Because Plato, the great
philosopher, wrote about it.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said Atlantis was ruled
by a scientific elite of 10

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.510 align:middle line:90%
god-kings, a top-down society.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.870 align:middle line:90%
But who were those god-kings?

00:19:54.870 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Those god-kings were the
Nephilim, or the sons of God,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:84%
that the Bible talks
about in Genesis.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And those god-kings
also gave mankind

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
very advanced
technology and science.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:84%
The evidence of that is the
precision by which the pyramids

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:84%
are made, and the fact
that things like Babylon

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and the Tower of
Babel was a stargate.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So these god-kings are ruling,
I believe-- this sounds sci-fi,

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:90%
but there's a reason for it.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:32.748 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I understand.

00:20:32.748 --> 00:20:36.307 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: They're ruling
the global economic order.

00:20:36.307 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they've
been around a long time.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCGUIRE: They've been
around since before Atlantis.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And I am convinced that Atlantis
is not a fictitional society.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a-- was a real society.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And to show you how seriously
the top people in our world

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:84%
take Atlantis-- the
elite of our world,

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:84%
the power elite,
if you will-- they

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:84%
read Plato, who is obsessed
with Atlantis constantly.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:11.651 align:middle line:84%
And they read about Plato's
new Atlantis as a model,

00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:12.275 align:middle line:90%
as a template--

00:21:12.275 --> 00:21:13.358 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a playbook.

00:21:13.358 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I have always
thought that our leaders looked

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:84%
at Revelation-- the
Book of Revelation--

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and they've created world
events to begin to match that.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.964 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:21:26.964 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, there's
an amazing parallel.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.234 align:middle line:84%
You have one thing--
you have Babylon,

00:21:32.234 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:84%
the first one-world government,
one-world economic system,

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:90%
one-world religion.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Then you have our time
period, where we're now

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:84%
the United Nations, the
international bank, IMF,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:90%
all that kinds of stuff.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.959 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:21:47.959 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take the
headquarters of the European

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Union in Brussels, the
architecture of that building--

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
it's in modern architecture,
but it's a modern architecture

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.600 align:middle line:90%
version of the Tower of Babel.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.635 align:middle line:90%
They say it themselves.

00:22:04.635 --> 00:22:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Isn't that amazing?

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.781 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: And then,
on their own posters,

00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:84%
they'll have the modern
architecture of the Tower

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of Babel, which is
their headquarters,

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.212 align:middle line:84%
with a painting of
the Tower of Babel.

00:22:15.212 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's not
an accident, either.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:84%
They're sending a
message, like you said.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
They're announcing
what they're doing.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they put
this metallic statue

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:90%
of a woman riding the beast.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.790 align:middle line:90%
That's right out of Revelation.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:90%
That woman is the harlot.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:84%
That woman is Babylon,
riding the beast system--

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
the Antichrist political
system-- into power.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.955 align:middle line:90%
They're saying it.

00:22:40.955 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is amazing stuff.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You have talked about with
the microchips, that there's

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
going to be a computer
brain interface, eventually.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.850 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yes.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.740 align:middle line:84%
HG Wells first
popularized this idea,

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
in a term he called the
World Brain, which he said

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:84%
would be like a
world encyclopedia.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.370 align:middle line:84%
But the world brain
that's evolving now

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:09.600 align:middle line:84%
is, like, on steroids compared
to what HG Wells talked about.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.561 align:middle line:84%
Now Google-- and I'm not
saying Google is a totalitarian

00:23:13.561 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:90%
That's not my point.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But it might be.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: It could
be, in the wrong hands.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
But Google is developing this
concept of a world brain.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And what it will be
is a supercomputer

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that contains all of
the world's information.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And it will also contain
super artificial intelligence.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's this giant
computer that contains

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:90%
all information, all ideas.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be just a
storage facility of philosophy

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:90%
and art and culture.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:84%
The world brain will be a
top-down domination system,

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:84%
where everybody, through
the microchip implant,

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:84%
will have a computer
brain interface embedded

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.550 align:middle line:90%
in their being.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And the world brain will control
your thoughts, your ideas,

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:90%
and dreams.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And we will live in some kind
of synthetic virtual world.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But it will be controlled
by this massive computer.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's frightening.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Who punches that button?

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, if Ray
Kurzweil and the other

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:32.130 align:middle line:84%
futurists are correct, and
the singularity takes place,

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and computers evolve,
and androids evolve,

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and artificial intelligence
evolves beyond mankind,

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.164 align:middle line:84%
it could be-- I'm
saying this somewhat--

00:24:43.164 --> 00:24:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They may takeover.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.038 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yeah.

00:24:45.038 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:84%
It could be the
robots run the world.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say, we do this.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect world.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Right.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There's
never a problem.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Right.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This Paul McGuire
guy's creating an issue for us.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Hit his button.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Right.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.991 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And let's
make a change with him.

00:25:01.991 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, the
kill switch would be

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.782 align:middle line:90%
in the microchip implant.

00:25:04.782 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: I hate to talk
about myself in that manner,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.321 align:middle line:84%
but the world brain
could decide--

00:25:11.321 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let's shut him down.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Right.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Pop, I'm gone.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yep, until we can
make a little repair with you

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Right, well maybe
make a clone and download

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.006 align:middle line:90%
the appropriate programming.

00:25:22.006 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Right, because
the first one didn't work.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly, right.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is frightening.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.688 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: It's frightening.

00:25:27.688 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Realistic?

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: We're here already.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
This is what people
don't understand.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about this in
my research, in my book,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and I keep saying it
over and over again.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:90%
People don't understand.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Some people do.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.467 align:middle line:84%
Your audience does,
proportionately.

00:25:45.467 --> 00:25:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're
passionate about it.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: They're passionate--

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you
were on Coast to Coast,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.640 align:middle line:84%
they went wild with
your information,

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.990 align:middle line:90%
as you probably know.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well,
because they're savvy,

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.870 align:middle line:90%
your guests and stuff-- and you.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:90%
You get them up to speed.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:06.730 align:middle line:84%
But the average American doesn't
understand that we are 50--

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and I believe, in many
cases, 200-- years more

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:84%
advanced in our
science and technology

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:90%
then most people realize.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what I'm saying
is that we are currently using,

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's currently operational,
science-fiction type technology

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that most people
don't think will

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.510 align:middle line:90%
arrive until about 200 years.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:90%
But it is here now.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's being used in
all kinds of applications.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it subtle
or is it direct?

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: It's subtle, and
it's hidden in plain sight.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Here is the irony--

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right under our noses.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Right
under our noses.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.010 align:middle line:90%
It's hidden in plain sight.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:90%
You know, here's an example.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Most people have-- think
of your brain like a box.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Now some people have a
small box for a brain.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And some people have a box the
size of a football stadium.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
The educational
system indoctrinates

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:90%
people to think in a small box.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So most people have a
ceiling on their ideas.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.236 align:middle line:84%
The elite don't
have that ceiling.

00:27:11.236 --> 00:27:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They don't.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: They
understand, for example,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that it's quite possible that
time travel is already here.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It is factual that telepathy
and technological telepathy

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.817 align:middle line:90%
is already being used.

00:27:27.817 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But the average person
doesn't realize that.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They don't know that

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.974 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: They
don't understand that,

00:27:31.974 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
through EMF waves, you can
project voices, pictures,

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and commands inside
people's brains.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But they don't want
the average person to know that

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.720 align:middle line:90%
or to understand it.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
They just want to
do it, implement it.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure our audience
drives them crazy,

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.152 align:middle line:90%
because we're aware of all this.

00:27:54.152 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Absolutley.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So they want--
and I'm convinced--

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:84%
they want sporting events
to keep the masses busy.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:84%
They just want to keep
them uptight with terrorism

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and other issues to
keep people frightened.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you can put people
in that kind of a box,

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.600 align:middle line:84%
they'll do anything
you want-- anything.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.534 align:middle line:84%
And that's the position I
think they want all of us in.

00:28:18.534 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yes, absolutely.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So people don't
understand that-- there's

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong in sports.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Sports is fun but most
people's minds is about sports.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's take porn.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Porn, neurologically, is
addictive as crack cocaine.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The reason porn is
allowed in our society

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do
with-- it's monetary,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.480 align:middle line:84%
but the primary purpose of
the widespread dissemination

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.380 align:middle line:84%
of porn on the internet is
it's a mechanism of control.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.700 align:middle line:84%
You keep people's
minds locked in

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.545 align:middle line:84%
to a cocaine-addictive
reality of virtual sex.

00:28:56.545 --> 00:28:58.496 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So they don't
look outside the box.

00:28:58.496 --> 00:29:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Excactly, so they
don't look outside the box.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And when they do,
then they have a problem.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Can we win, Paul?

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.319 align:middle line:84%
Can we stop all these
atrocities from occurring?

00:29:09.319 --> 00:29:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: This is something
that I'm very passionate about.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's the message
of my book, A Prophecy

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.960 align:middle line:90%
of the Future of America.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
There are many people who teach
Bible prophecy and research

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Bible prophecy that I believe
are correct in one sense.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.910 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, God specifically
outlines his predictive end

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:90%
times prophetic program.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.400 align:middle line:90%
That cannot be undone.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.570 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you're not
going to keep the Antichrist

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.250 align:middle line:84%
from coming, and
you're not going

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.600 align:middle line:84%
to stop the microchip implant
or the tribulation period

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:90%
from coming.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
going to happen.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: That's
going to happen.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
going to happen.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.135 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Christ is going
to return at some point

00:29:46.135 --> 00:29:47.450 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
many areas where

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:84%
the predictive prophecies
of the Bible is silent.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:30:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And in those situations, without
going into theological detail,

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:84%
God expects people
to do what is right,

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
to stand up for what is true,
to pray, and to live out

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:84%
their faith, which is
always love in action.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
The beast system the Antichrist
system, is absent of love.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So when people put
love into action,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that means telling
the truth and not

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:90%
going along with the program.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:84%
We in America,
for example, if we

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:35.050 align:middle line:84%
were to take that mandate
seriously, we could delay,

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and by God's grace,
see a reprieve,

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:84%
or the brakes put
on this system.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And that would mean a
real hope for the future

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:84%
for our children and
our grandchildren.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
That's not antithetical
to Bible prophecy.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's
what God expects us to do.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I think
that's very possible.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Paul, thanks for being
on Beyond Belief.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Thank you, George.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Great information.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: OK.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So one day you may be
approached, and they may say,

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:07.410 align:middle line:84%
hey, it's time for you to get
a microchip implanted in you.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Will you do it?

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.965 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.

00:31:11.965 --> 00:31:28.100 align:middle line:90%
