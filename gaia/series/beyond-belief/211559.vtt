>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:10%
Bree Melanson is with us, a
channeler and spiritual teacher

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:10%
who offers a grounded
approach to spirituality, ETs,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:10%
and self-healing by removing
the divide between the material

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:10%
and metaphysical world.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Bree has channeled
various ET groups,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
like the Arcturians
and the Pleiadians,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and appears in Gaia's
original program, "Channeling

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.380 align:middle line:90%
- A Bridge to the Beyond."

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.602 align:middle line:90%
Bree, welcome to the program.

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BREE MELANSON:
Thank you so much.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:90%
It's such an honor to be here.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:10%
>>MELANSON: Well, I think it
was a slow, natural unfolding.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:10%
I guess, like most
things, I was always

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:10%
enthralled with the
metaphysical world, and healing,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.590 align:middle line:10%
and how the mind works,
and eventually, I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:10%
guess, surrendered to it.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:10%
I lived a pretty normal life.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.968 align:middle line:84%
Went to college, studied
business, was a dancer--

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before any
of this happened?

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was open as
a child, which again, I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
think we all are very
intuitive beings naturally.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us aren't really
given parameters or a framework

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
or really anywhere to put
those inner knowings or skills.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So I shut it off
for most of my life

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:84%
but was always really interested
in quantum physics and healing.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the pivot
was I was on a plane,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was reading yet
another spiritual book,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and the author was talking
about having a spiritual healer.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And I just was like, if
I'm supposed to do this,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to
need a teacher.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even realize
it was an option

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:90%
to have a spiritual teacher.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, on the way
back on that trip,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.158 align:middle line:84%
said teacher sat next to me,
handed me her card, and said,

00:01:58.158 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:90%
you should take my class.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up
studying under her.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that started it.

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:03.145 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah,
and just practiced

00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:90%
and kept honing in on things.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we all have our
own definition for channeling.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:90%
What do you say channeling is?

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, I
see channeling as--

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
the shortest answer is kind
of becoming the mic, right?

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we
discuss channeling,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:84%
to also keep in mind
that intuition, again,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:90%
is the most natural part of us.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's really just
a matter of learning

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:84%
how to dissipate the
ego mind and tune

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
back into the truest essence
of ourselves and our guidance

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
are channeling, we

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
are allowing a lot of
ourselves to move to the side

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to allow for
information to come through

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
beyond just our sense of
self and our own intelligence

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.893 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Bree,
when you channel,

00:02:49.893 --> 00:02:51.865 align:middle line:90%
who are you channeling?

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Or what are you channeling?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, I
think some channels

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
tend to have a main boo,
a main spiritual boo,

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:90%
like Abraham Hicks.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Esther Hicks channels Abraham.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or Seth.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.643 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Or Seth, yeah.

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Many examples of
channels learning

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
to resonate with a
certain frequency

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
and sticking within that.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
I tend to work with,
as you've mentioned,

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians, Arcturians,
Lemurians, ascended masters,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.970 align:middle line:90%
even religious figures, angels.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I guess I'm just--

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.130 align:middle line:84%
might parallel more of
my life as a free spirit.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they come to
you, or do you go to them?

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: In the way that
I've learned how to do it,

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.778 align:middle line:84%
and I guess the way that I
practice, is I usually set

00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
the intention of connecting
with a certain intelligence

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and energy, and
get into the state

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:84%
until I feel their
resonance enough.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.362 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it usually
just takes a few minutes.

00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At the
end of the program,

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Bree is going to do
a channeling for us

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
to show us a little
bit how it happens.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, channeling generally
allows you to tap into what?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Higher information.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Generally, when
something is channeled,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
it's something that we--
it's information that we

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:90%
aren't quite embodying yet.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
Also, channeling will always be
based in oneness consciousness.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:90%
So they'll speak in we.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
It will support our growth.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
It'll be based in
love and support,

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
be void of separation
or judgment.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So I think beyond the
incredible, incredible

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
information that
can come through,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I think what's unique
about channeling

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a very physical
experience of feeling

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
into higher information,
even if you are just

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.530 align:middle line:90%
witnessing the channel.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And also, I think, allows us to
feel the essence of our greater

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.920 align:middle line:84%
selves so we can know
that we're connected.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But to actually watch a channel
shift into a higher frequency

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and feel that higher frequency
as a witness, I think,

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:90%
is a very powerful thing.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree, is
there a difference

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
between channeling and
receiving psychic messages?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:84%
The way that I see it, we
are all receiving information

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.090 align:middle line:90%
through energy all the time.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly, right?

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, we're
unaware of a lot of things

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:90%
that we're processing.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to take an
example of, say, a medium

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.310 align:middle line:84%
or-- if I were to
practice mediumship,

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:90%
it's like having a conversation.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking a question.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm receiving information,
and then translating it.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
When you channel, there's
not that lapse of time.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's happening in
real time, and it's

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
coming through as a funnel
or a channel in the moment,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:90%
in the present.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about some
of your earlier experiences.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:84%
What were some of the things
that you went through?

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: So the first time
that I saw somebody channel,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:90%
it was a mentor of mine.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I was having a personal
energy session done,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:90%
and she started channeling.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.150 align:middle line:90%
It was very strange to me.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I had never seen it before.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And she was connecting
with Kuan Yin.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.567 align:middle line:84%
And Kuan Yin looked
at me and said,

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:90%
why aren't you doing this?

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:90%
You can do this.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the moment,
even though my mentor

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
is amazing and definitely
trusted her, just part of me

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:84%
thought, what, act
weird and use an accent?

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:90%
I had no framework for it.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first time
I experienced seeing it,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and then later took a
class from this mentor.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I first did embody
channeling, when they spoke,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
they said, she is
afraid to be wrong.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:90%
And it felt very strange.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't necessarily
scary, but it definitely

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
pulled me back into my
conscious Bree-ness.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Back to reality?

00:06:58.445 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, back to--

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Or yeah, the reality
that we're experiencing.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of leaned into
channeled, almost transcribing.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:90%
So writing.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, those were, I guess,
some of my first experiences.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you channel, are
they in your body, this entity?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:90%
Or how do you tap into it?

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: The way
that I understand

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.150 align:middle line:84%
is that it is more of
a match of frequency.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like we are
meeting at a state of--

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bliss?

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Well, it is--

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like you would be
meeting at a certain channel,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So I do feel their
presence within me,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and I don't feel
how I usually feel.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.390 align:middle line:84%
When you're
channeling, it's kind

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
of like your identity
is in the background.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.145 align:middle line:84%
So you're watching what's
happening, you're aware,

00:07:56.145 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
but it feels like being in a
really deep meditative state,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:90%
or almost sleep state, I guess.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree, you
mentioned, as a child,

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:90%
a lot of this happened to you.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Do we shut down these special
gifts that we have as children?

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Or do we accent it?

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Usually,
we shut them down

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:84%
because, again, we're not
given any framework for them

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:90%
or anywhere for them to be used.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.608 align:middle line:84%
So as a kid, if I
was seeing things

00:08:24.608 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and nobody else was
seeing them, it's

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:84%
going to easily
transfer to fear.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And as a coping
mechanism, I'm likely

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:90%
just going to shut that down.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's quite common for
kids to be really intuitive.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.942 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of fresh off the
boat and totally turned on.

00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not tainted.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, mhm.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Channelers
from Gaia's program,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
the original series "Channeling
- A Bridge to the Beyond,"

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
explain how children lose some
of their intuitive ability.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Mhm.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:10%
>>LAURA ALDEN KAMM:
Children's intuitive systems

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.150 align:middle line:10%
are wide open when they're born.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:10%
It's the ages of five, six,
and seven when we take them

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:10%
to school and start to conform
with rules and regulations,

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:10%
which are fine and
necessary, but it starts

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:10%
to shut that system down.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
They move from their inner
world to the outer world.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's when social
constructed reality really

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
starts to set in and kind of
jam up the system a little bit.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really interesting

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
that, in psychology, hero
worship starts around eight

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.990 align:middle line:90%
to 10 to 12 years of age.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we
take our inner superhero

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and we take it outside
of us and put it

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
into animation, and Superman,
and Spider-Man, and Wonder

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Woman.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:90%
But really, we are those inside.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:90%
We can see through walls.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:84%
We can leap with our mind
anywhere we want to go.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE: We all
have evidence in our lives.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.630 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.880 align:middle line:10%
At some point, we heard a voice.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.150 align:middle line:10%
We had a gut feeling.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:84%
We followed a knowing, and we
don't know where it came from,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:90%
and everything worked out.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:84%
We have evidence in our
lives, large or small,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.180 align:middle line:84%
where we've listened to that
whisper, that inner whisper,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
whether it's our
higher self or a guide

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.150 align:middle line:90%
or whatever we want to call it.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what we need
to pay attention to.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we get that
impulse, we get the whisper,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and then our intellectual
mind takes over and starts

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:90%
talking us out of it.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Paying attention to that first
insight, that first message,

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:90%
and follow it through.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And then our intellect will
not try to discourage us from--

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.780 align:middle line:84%
it just wants to stay in
control and protect us.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But our intuition
is where we expand.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree can we
condition ourselves to get

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.715 align:middle line:90%
better and better at this?

00:11:03.715 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: For sure, yeah.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like a muscle, and also
really just like a remembering.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I honestly believe that our
intuitive self is our most

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.500 align:middle line:90%
natural self and expression.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it is just
heeding to the things that

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:84%
make us feel at peace,
make us feel in flow.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, quieting the mind.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of when you're learning
to reactivate your intuition,

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
you're often guided
through meditation,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:84%
which is really just the process
of getting the ego mind out

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.040 align:middle line:90%
of the way.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And she makes a
really good point

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:84%
of giving that intuition
somewhere to go.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
So getting the nudge is one
thing, but following through

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
is another.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we
can follow our intuition

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and give it more
reason to come through,

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.185 align:middle line:90%
the more we can receive.

00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
introduction, we

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:84%
talked about how you channel the
Pleiadians, and the Arcturians.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:90%
How did that all start for you?

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: So I attended a
energetic activation group

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
class, and I'm generally not
that energetically sensitive.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But afterwards, I felt
really high, [CHUCKLES]

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.340 align:middle line:84%
incredibly joyful for quite
a few hours afterwards.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I got curious
as to who they were.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.482 align:middle line:84%
And I went home,
and at that time,

00:12:23.482 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:90%
I had learned how to channel.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of
asked, who are you guys?

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:90%
What is the deal?

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're aliens, right?

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah,
I think as we're

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
exploring these new
territories, semantics

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
is something that we will
continue to move through.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:84%
If it's aliens, or ETs, or
interdimensional beings,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:90%
or light beings.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I think, yeah, they're
all-- to me, I--

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
benefits of talking to ETs?

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, I think
if we are functioning from

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
the premise and the
understanding that they have

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.123 align:middle line:84%
been able to, at the
very least, surpass--

00:12:59.123 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've been there.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.082 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: --structures
of time and space,

00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:84%
they can travel through light,
I reckon they know a little bit

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:90%
more than we do.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And all the information that
I've ever received from them

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
has been incredibly
loving, and high,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:90%
and supportive, and helpful.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
things do they tell you?

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, to
remember our true nature,

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and to not look to the
external for power or guidance.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
We hear all the time
that we are infinite,

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're capable of
creating many things.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And they've given
a lot of pathways

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and how to access that
part of ourselves,

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and dissolve the ego mind,
as they talked about.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree, how do you know
they're not misleading you?

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, before
I started channeling,

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I did readings for
many years, and I

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:84%
learned how to develop
quite strong boundaries

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:90%
and discernment.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that is
an important thing when

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.170 align:middle line:84%
you are channeling or learning
how to access your intuition.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And something that
happens naturally

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
is you end up working
through boundaries

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and moving more into a place
of empowerment and discernment.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So I have never
experienced anything

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that we would call dark
or that has affected me

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.122 align:middle line:90%
in any real negative way.

00:14:18.122 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you been lucky?

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: [CHUCKLES]
I think it's

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:25.270 align:middle line:84%
a matter of the
consciousness that I've held.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if a person
walks into the room

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're really
in their power,

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.980 align:middle line:84%
you kind of understand
not to push, right?

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a game
of power, but I

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
like to think more that it's
our resonance that protects us

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:84%
than needing to
protect ourselves

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:90%
from some unknown entity.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have regular
entities that come to you?

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, when I
work with the Pleiadians,

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
or the Arcturians,
I do believe that I

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:90%
work with a similar group.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just as we
call upon people

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that match our energy
and our value system

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and our intentions
in life, of course,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:90%
there's a parallel within that.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we talked earlier
about some channels

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.530 align:middle line:84%
having specific beings,
I think, that yeah,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.050 align:middle line:84%
there's some type of
karmic connection there.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
access these channels?

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I learned
through a teacher,

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:90%
again, how to create boundaries.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, part of it has just
been my journey as an intuitive

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to get myself out of the
way as much as possible

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and sit in the
intention and anchor,

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and the intention of wanting
to be of service or move

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
more towards my expansion
or our expansion.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree, have you
ever been scared channeling?

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I think when I
was first discovering it,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:90%
it was definitely foreign.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I've been more scared to show
myself channeling because it

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:90%
can look kind of crazy.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And I'm
continuing to just move

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:84%
through those
little fear portals.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
the soul mean to you?

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I think of the
soul as our whole being.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's a really
helpful and important practice

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:84%
for us to always try on
that and ask ourselves--

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:84%
if I were to describe my soul,
if I had a soul, which we do,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:90%
what--

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, we do.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.723 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: --would
my soul feel like.

00:16:22.723 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and what types of things
would my soul enjoy doing.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:84%
When would I feel the
essence of my soul.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The soul is "the aspect of
me that...," that is innate,

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:84%
that is peaceful, that is
harmonious, that is knowing,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:90%
that is in the present.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a really great
exercise to just try on.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to
Gaia's "Channeling -

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:84%
A Bridge to the Beyond," they
talk a lot about channeling

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and entities, and how to access
and get better insight from

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.208 align:middle line:90%
the soul.

00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:10%
>>BASHAR: Everything
is here and now.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:10%
Everything is all connected.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:10%
It's not a particular
place you have to go.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:10%
It can be accessed
from anywhere.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:10%
Anywhere, anytime.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just the idea that all
information never goes away.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.560 align:middle line:90%
It's all here and now.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.910 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be destroyed.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:90%
It cannot cease to exist.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you are the frequency
of a particular piece

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:16.319 align:middle line:84%
of information, that's
the kind of information

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that will, so to speak,
pop into your awareness.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Because information is
accessible from anywhere,

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:90%
anytime, anyplace.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:10%
>>THEO: The best way to
describe in human knowledge

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:10%
a certain record keeping.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It is not a library of
books held somewhere.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But it is information
that is in the soul, that

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
is a continuum, that is resonant
in each cell of your body.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So the record is held
there, within your being.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Your human experience
is the earthsuit

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that you've chosen to
navigate this planet.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul
enters this earthsuit.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:10%
It has cells, which the
soul permeates all of them.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:10%
And that is where the records
are held, in all those cells,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:10%
but more importantly in
the energy of the soul that

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:10%
is eternal.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And speak of it as one's
multidimensionality and

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:90%
vibrational frequency.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:10%
>>THE ARCTURIANS: Your universal
self cannot be found within

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:10%
the thinking mind.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.655 align:middle line:84%
This is just meant
to process, yes?

00:18:44.655 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:90%
To receive, process, transmit.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:84%
You have learned this
through the internet.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Look at the way that
you have expanded

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:90%
through your technology, yes?

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:04.600 align:middle line:84%
You used to get news maybe
months, years, from somebody

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the world.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a phone
conversation with them, yes?

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So it is becoming
more available.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And so is your connection
to this universal mind

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:90%
and through your higher mind.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you are looking
for this universal mind,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
would you not connect
with your universal self?

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it important
to access our soul?

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I think accessing
our soul is more or less

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
the answer to everything
because the reason we suffer

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:90%
is always within the ego mind.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And if our soul is
the aspect of us--

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I like to think that it's our
tether to this idea of source

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:90%
of the universal mind, or God.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the part of us
that is connected

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:06.270 align:middle line:84%
to harmony and creative
power and guidance.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So as we learn to
nurture our soul--

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and again, as they've
shared and we've discussed,

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
it's much more tangible and
physical and within reach.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So the more that we can
harness that and nurture

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that part of ourselves,
the more access we

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
have to universal intelligence,
greater creative power,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:90%
healing potential, et cetera.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have always
believed that we are portals.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.860 align:middle line:90%
But to what?

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, to our
ascension and our freedom.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:10%
I think it's fun and it
can be exciting to think

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:10%
about other dimensions but I
think, more importantly, it

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:10%
is to try to integrate the
information that comes through

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:10%
from these dimensions.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is generally about
moving past our own fears.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And our fears are really
meant to set us free,

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:90%
and we can only do that.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:90%
We can only set ourselves free.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, we are the portal
to everything that we ask for.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever meet a
channel, Bree, you didn't like?

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.987 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: [LAUGHS] Not yet.

00:21:15.987 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I need to meet more.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't look
forward to that, do you?

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: [LAUGHS]
--a channel.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some
of the things you've

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:90%
learned from some of these ETs?

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.967 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.967 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: A massive
amount of information.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I continue to
integrate everything

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that I receive into my
programs and my classes.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think the practice
alone has helped me to dissolve

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.472 align:middle line:90%
my own attachments to my ego.

00:21:40.472 --> 00:21:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has it made
you a better person?

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: It's made
my experience of life

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.350 align:middle line:84%
lighter and more joyous
and more expansive.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I guess you'd have to
ask other people if it's

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:90%
made me a better person.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:90%
I'd hope so.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
happier doing this?

00:21:54.455 --> 00:21:55.255 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:21:55.255 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:84%
It feels like I'm always
ideally moving, yeah,

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:90%
towards the light.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a difference
between the Pleiadians

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:90%
and the Arcturians?

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, you
know, I have always been

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:84%
more interested in, again, the
information that comes through.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I also haven't allowed
myself to read a lot of

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:84%
or consume a lot of information
so that what I receive

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.220 align:middle line:90%
isn't tainted.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I can say from experience
that both of their energies

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:90%
feel very loving and supportive.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I first was channeling the
Lumerians and the Pleiadians,

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and then a few years ago I was
introduced to the Arcturians,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and they were very polite.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And I have continued,
yeah, to connect with them.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when they
first came to contact you,

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.120 align:middle line:84%
what kind of state
of mind were you in,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.992 align:middle line:90%
and what was the episode?

00:22:52.992 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah,
so the first time

00:22:54.450 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I connected with the Pleiadians,
it was after that activation.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I sat down to essentially take
dictation, or channel write.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And they just laid out that
they were here to help us,

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're working
with us, like many other

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional beings.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're working
with lightworkers,

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and they used the
word "experiment."

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, can you
guys use a different word?

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're an experiment?

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.233 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: They replaced
it with experience.

00:23:30.233 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
that works better.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we're a part of it.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
we do have will,

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and that our will is
how we are choosing

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.890 align:middle line:84%
to use that life force energy
that we're all connected to.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you weren't in
contact with the Arcturians

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:84%
or the Pleiadians,
would you still

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:90%
be able to channel something?

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, I've
channeled a lot of different--

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.723 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The spirit
world, for example?

00:23:58.723 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, mhm.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I worked as a medium
and an intuitive for many years.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I channeled,
when I first started,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I actually would use these
ascended master cards.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And I would just pull,
give myself a pull,

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and channel the
three that came in

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.260 align:middle line:84%
so I could get used to working
with different energies.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know that
they're not playing tricks

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:90%
with you?

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, I have honed
in on my ability to, I think,

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
discern energy
information and intention.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you don't
think you can be tricked?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I think
it's possible, yeah.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I also haven't
experienced anything

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:84%
in my life that's been
negative, or there

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been any evidence for
me being tricked by anything.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's all been very
loving and supportive,

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:84%
so it's only enlightened my life
and those that I share it with.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This connection
with the Pleiadians,

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
does it get better
and better for you?

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: I think so.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:84%
I guess I would say,
if we are integrating

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
the information
that comes through,

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:84%
meaning if we are
putting it into practice,

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:84%
then essentially the
information can expand,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and we can understand
higher ideas.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I mean, they work
with the channel's ability

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.717 align:middle line:90%
to understand something.

00:25:30.717 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes they'll
ask me to-- if I'm

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:84%
asking about some
type of manifestation,

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.270 align:middle line:84%
they'll ask me to watch a video
on, I don't know, black holes

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:84%
or some type of
quantum something

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:84%
so that I can better understand
what they're trying to express.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who initiates the
questioning, you or them?

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Sometimes I open and
just ask what are we to know.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, I will
go in with some type

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.922 align:middle line:90%
of intention or question.

00:25:55.922 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you awake?

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Do you know consciously
that you're doing this?

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I feel like
I'm in the far background.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So when I come out of
the meditative state,

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I have a general awareness
of what was discussed,

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
exactly what it is.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
if I'm writing

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still in that state,
and I'll have pages and pages

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:90%
come through.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
when I'm writing

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that my identity was saying,
well, this isn't that good.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:90%
That's not really what I wanted.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be good enough
for this thing that I'm doing.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll read through
it from a conscious state,

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's incredibly
beautiful and powerful.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think that
doubt and that ego

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:84%
is always still giving
opinions on some level.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they look like?

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I have never
been super clairvoyant.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm more claircognizant
and clairaudient,

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:56.195 align:middle line:84%
which I think has allowed me to
become more of a clear channel.

00:26:56.195 --> 00:26:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So I don't get a lot of
visuals, but I do understand

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:90%
that they have bodies.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:84%
They're a little bit more
mutable and changeable

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have as much
of a reliance on their form

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.690 align:middle line:90%
as we do, or the identity.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During an intentional
meditation for ETs in contact,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:23.240 align:middle line:84%
you appeared to bring an entity
of light into your house.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what we're seeing.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, so
I was making a video,

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed these lights
that were around me.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like orbs.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:10%
So I stopped whatever I was
doing, and I just stood there,

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:10%
and I actually played
these tones that

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:10%
were a part of the CE5 app.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:10%
And then, yeah, watched it
later and saw these orbs.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.530 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting--
with the tones or the sound

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:10%
that I was using when
I was doing this,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.708 align:middle line:10%
they kind of moved with it.

00:28:04.708 --> 00:28:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So that one that
came from the corner

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.550 align:middle line:84%
was fast, and then
this one, because--

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:90%
maybe its kind of music--

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:12.820 align:middle line:90%
it was slower.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, yeah, it goes around
my body, and back up it.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a beautiful example
of how much there is going on

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.587 align:middle line:90%
beyond our conscious awareness.

00:28:25.587 --> 00:28:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that wasn't
somebody with a flashlight

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:90%
in front of you?

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: The orchestration!

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.645 align:middle line:90%
What we do for attention!

00:28:31.645 --> 00:28:33.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, no.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it surprised me
when I thought I saw it,

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and then when I
recorded and saw this.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you
feel the light on you?

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: I didn't feel it.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:47.694 align:middle line:84%
I just had a knowing
that it was there.

00:28:47.694 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've
been channeling,

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.450 align:middle line:90%
what's next for you?

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.630 align:middle line:90%
What do you do next?

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: You know, I--

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.100 align:middle line:84%
well, my intention is
always to help people

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.653 align:middle line:84%
to remember their true
potential, and who they are,

00:29:03.653 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:90%
and that we're not our pain.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.370 align:middle line:90%
That we're not our stories.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And that we truly
are incredible,

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:84%
miraculous beings here to
really shift consciousness.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I was channeling
the other day, and I

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:23.900 align:middle line:84%
saw what I couldn't quite
maybe lay out quite yet,

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
but it looked like I
was channeling almost

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to an extent of which
they were offering

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.450 align:middle line:84%
some really powerful,
I want to say,

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:90%
activations or energy healing.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So it looked like there
was more of a merge somehow

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.440 align:middle line:90%
that was happening.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So as far as channeling
goes, it looks

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:90%
like it can continue to expand.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And I also think
that as we choose

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.820 align:middle line:84%
to come from spirit,
as we grow personally,

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:04.550 align:middle line:84%
as we work on our own things
and move past our own fears,

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that we will open
more collectively.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:84%
More people will
be able to channel.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, as we kind
of lighten our load

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.483 align:middle line:84%
and drop our ego
stuff along the way.

00:30:16.483 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other kinds
of physical contacts

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:90%
have you had with the ETs?

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I have seen
them in the sky quite a bit.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:90%
And I also believe I've had--

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I really don't like
the word "abduction."

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was just going to ask
you, have you ever been taken?

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: It feels--
the word "abduction"

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.070 align:middle line:90%
feels really invasive and--

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Illegal.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But I have had a
couple experiences

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:90%
where I was in Vancouver, BC.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:52.015 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of friends
there, and my mom lives there.

00:30:52.015 --> 00:30:56.343 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced a lot of
fatigue, and I didn't know--

00:30:56.343 --> 00:30:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow,
I'm really tired,

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.903 align:middle line:90%
and I slept the full night.

00:30:58.903 --> 00:31:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
wrong with me,

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and I was like having
all these espressos.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was doing the trick.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.958 align:middle line:84%
And I also noticed some
markings on my back.

00:31:06.958 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
When it kind of hit me
what it might have been,

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I Googled alien
abduction marks on back,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and there was just
a plethora of them

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.460 align:middle line:90%
that looked exactly the same.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a
picture of your back.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at it, and you
can tell us a little bit more.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, so you can
see it's a little bit faded

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.973 align:middle line:84%
but on this bottom
one they were in--

00:31:30.973 --> 00:31:32.890 align:middle line:84%
there's three, three,
and three, and it's kind

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:33.620 align:middle line:90%
of in a diamond shape.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, there's a
close-up right underneath it.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, so they
were these perfect symmetrical

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.800 align:middle line:90%
imprints.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I was like,
what did I lean up against?

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.998 align:middle line:90%
What did I sleep on?

00:31:42.998 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
still on your back?

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: No.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.630 align:middle line:90%
They were kind of like bruises.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:84%
They didn't hurt, but they
went away in a few days.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And then it happened again, I
think, several months later.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Again, when I was in the same
place in BC, and same markings,

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.720 align:middle line:90%
same experience of fatigue.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And also, when I had Googled the
pictures, when I looked deeper

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.723 align:middle line:84%
at it, there were quite a lot of
them that came from that area.

00:32:14.723 --> 00:32:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's quite
an active area.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you think
those marks got there?

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: So from
what I understand,

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.408 align:middle line:90%
they share that they're--

00:32:26.408 --> 00:32:31.040 align:middle line:84%
they said that it was like
an energetic upgrade for me

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.330 align:middle line:90%
as far as what--

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They upgraded you, eh?

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.092 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Just energetically.

00:32:35.092 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:84%
They said that if you
are to help people

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.400 align:middle line:84%
hold a certain
frequency, that I would

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:84%
need to be able to hold that
frequency within myself.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And I also understand that they
were able to take information

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:90%
from my ethereal body.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.705 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think my physical
body floated out of the window.

00:32:55.705 --> 00:32:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
not sure, though?

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.455 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I'm quite-- well,
the night that it happened,

00:32:59.455 --> 00:33:00.913 align:middle line:84%
I was sleeping at
a friend's house,

00:33:00.913 --> 00:33:02.455 align:middle line:84%
and we were sleeping
in the same bed.

00:33:02.455 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:05.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't say.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But they told me that it
wasn't a physical-- it

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:12.590 align:middle line:84%
was my ethereal body, but
from the ethereal body

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:84%
that they could still
get all the information

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:16.990 align:middle line:90%
from the physical.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And they also shared
that they took kind

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.690 align:middle line:84%
of like a snapshot of all
my potential realities

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.220 align:middle line:90%
within a certain radius.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So if this was
included, that radius,

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.700 align:middle line:84%
then they'd be taking
the information

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:84%
from our consciousness
in this moment, as well.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.645 align:middle line:84%
So they described it as
they were understanding

00:33:37.645 --> 00:33:42.010 align:middle line:84%
where we are at
consciously, and then

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:46.110 align:middle line:84%
also the energetic
kind of adjustment

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.822 align:middle line:84%
that I may have
needed for my path.

00:33:47.822 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Alright, Bree, show
us a little bit of channeling,

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.325 align:middle line:90%
how you do this.

00:33:51.325 --> 00:33:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: OK, yeah.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.912 align:middle line:84%
So I just will need a minute
to just get out of the way.

00:33:56.912 --> 00:33:57.712 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Alright.

00:33:57.712 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: And yeah, and
then you can ask questions.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm also going to take a
sip of water really fast.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Alright.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you do
this channeling,

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.679 align:middle line:84%
you have to meditate a little
bit to get into a certain mode?

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, I--

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I think there's people,
like incredible channels,

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.790 align:middle line:90%
like Bashar, who have been--

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.010 align:middle line:84%
or Darryl, that
channels Bashar, that

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.449 align:middle line:84%
have been doing
it for many years,

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and it may come a little bit
more quickly or second nature.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:10%
If you see some of the older
videotapes of Esther Hicks when

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.510 align:middle line:10%
she channels Abraham,
you'll notice

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.260 align:middle line:10%
that her voice gets
really high, and there's

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.850 align:middle line:10%
a visible difference.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you alert?

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what's going on?

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I do, but I
have to completely let go.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, being a part of
that series was such a gift,

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.880 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very thankful for it.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
I also had to really get
over [CHUCKLES] the way

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.620 align:middle line:90%
that I look when I do it.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the shifts
in sound and mannerisms

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:07.070 align:middle line:90%
is just a matter of energy.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I was swaying a lot
when I was doing that.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, afterwards--
just even, actually,

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.760 align:middle line:90%
about a month ago--

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.435 align:middle line:84%
I understood to open my root
chakra more, and it stopped.

00:35:17.435 --> 00:35:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, that would have
been really helpful information

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:90%
before we filmed that.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a
matter of, I think,

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.940 align:middle line:84%
their energy trying to ground,
and the difference between ours

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:90%
and their frequency.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Alright, well, show us
a little channeling.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Alright, cool.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why are you smiling?

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PLEIADIANS: We are reminding
her of the fun of it,

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.440 align:middle line:90%
and how fun the experience is.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And if it is not fun and
if it does not fill you

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.607 align:middle line:90%
with light, then why bother?

00:36:22.607 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you say "we."

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PLEIADIANS: So we are the
group of which you call,

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:90%
and that we are, the Pleiadians.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.653 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:34.653 --> 00:36:36.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you channel
through Bree quite often?

00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:43.030 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PLEIADIANS: Yes, she is--

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting because it
is quite her human nature

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.220 align:middle line:90%
to be human.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
times in which she

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:03.200 align:middle line:90%
is showing up in service, or--

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:90%
yes, we will say this suffices.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:10.820 align:middle line:84%
When she is called to show
up in service, we are there.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But we are always
aware of her path,

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and always supporting her to
come into alignment with what

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:29.150 align:middle line:84%
we could say-- love, light,
harmony, ascension, growth,

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.660 align:middle line:90%
communion, and collaboration.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, is
it in this state

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:38.067 align:middle line:84%
that you pass on
information to her?

00:37:38.067 --> 00:37:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PLEIADIANS: Yes, mostly.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And we also would like
to remind everybody

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:84%
of their incredible
connection, yes.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And so regardless if it comes
from a Pleiadian or Arcturian

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:59.760 align:middle line:84%
or your favorite angel, we
ask you to consider, foremost,

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:04.940 align:middle line:84%
your intention to connect
with other realms,

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:84%
meaning what is it,
and how will you

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.920 align:middle line:84%
channel the information
that comes through.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And it is not just
this linear information

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.710 align:middle line:90%
that is passed along, yes.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:22.800 align:middle line:84%
There is a great remembrance
that occurs when you connect,

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So when you connect
with a realm or a being

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.230 align:middle line:84%
that you have deemed
outside of yourself,

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:34.370 align:middle line:84%
you are moreso, and also
perhaps more importantly,

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:38.760 align:middle line:84%
connecting with the larger
and greater aspect of you.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, do you need Bree
in order to do what you do?

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PLEIADIANS: Well, we are happy
to collaborate in this way.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:55.070 align:middle line:84%
There are-- again, there
are ways in which you are

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.050 align:middle line:90%
receiving--

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.270 align:middle line:90%
we won't say our information.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.120 align:middle line:84%
We will say light
information-- as you

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:84%
move throughout what you have
deemed your physical realm.

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So as you are walking in nature,
you are receiving great wisdom,

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can receive
great heights of wisdom

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:18.620 align:middle line:84%
through what the Earth
consciousness holds.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:84%
We are happy to come
through in this way,

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:26.570 align:middle line:84%
but we are also saying that our
information is not ours, yes.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:33.820 align:middle line:84%
We are, as you are, a vessel
for divine intelligence.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.695 align:middle line:90%


00:39:36.695 --> 00:39:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of information

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.410 align:middle line:84%
are you trying to
impart on her now?

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PLEIADIANS: Well,
we are hopeful

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:50.570 align:middle line:84%
that, through this
interaction, above all,

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:53.690 align:middle line:84%
you are reminded
that you are not just

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.700 align:middle line:90%
this skin and bones, yes.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.720 align:middle line:84%
You are far more than what
meets your physical eye,

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and you can come to know
your physical senses

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.990 align:middle line:90%
to be your metaphysical.

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in God?

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PLEIADIANS: Well, we
find it interesting the--

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.160 align:middle line:90%
we won't say incessant.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We will say habitual
nature of humans

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:84%
to attempt to put the idea
of infinite consciousness

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and the manifestation of this
consciousness in a box, yes.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
ideas of what God is.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And we will say that God
speaks through all things.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:46.170 align:middle line:84%
God, as you would
have it, is the fabric

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:50.160 align:middle line:84%
that holds all things
as one, and allows

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:57.550 align:middle line:84%
for there to be harmony and
collaboration of this oneness.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So we can say that we are
all God, in this manner.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you bring
Bree back for a moment?

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.988 align:middle line:90%
>>PLEIADIANS: Yes.

00:41:07.988 --> 00:41:09.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bree, are you here?

00:41:09.155 --> 00:41:10.072 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Thank you.

00:41:10.072 --> 00:41:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, can you
recollect what you just did?

00:41:14.015 --> 00:41:16.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.770 align:middle line:10%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, it always
takes me just a second to hop

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:22.920 align:middle line:10%
back in the driver's seat.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.262 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Get back
in your body, Bree.

00:41:25.262 --> 00:41:26.123 align:middle line:90%
Come back.

00:41:26.123 --> 00:41:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Bring Bree back.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] Yeah.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.460 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it just feels like--

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:84%
they call it channeling
for a reason, I suppose.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:43.780 align:middle line:10%
It does feel like tuning
into a different channel.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.150 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, because it feels
like a stream of--

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:52.470 align:middle line:10%
I guess the relation we
make is when we do something

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:57.390 align:middle line:10%
like free writing, or we
really open to our creativity

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:01.590 align:middle line:10%
when you allow that
flow to take over,

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:05.920 align:middle line:10%
would be the closest that we
get in our everyday lives.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:10%
I think--

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do
they want from us?

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I don't
think they want anything.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:17.430 align:middle line:10%
I really do feel that they're
here to help us along our path,

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:20.370 align:middle line:10%
and that we are
connected in ways, maybe,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:24.605 align:middle line:10%
that our linear mind can't
quite construct or understand.

00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:25.980 align:middle line:84%
When I first
connected with them,

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.000 align:middle line:84%
they were like, we're
from your future,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.890 align:middle line:90%
but we're also from your past.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
think we're savages?

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: No.

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Their messages are always loving
and not judgmental at all.

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:84%
We all-- a few years
ago, I was just

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.090 align:middle line:84%
kind of watching
the world unfold.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, kind
of just thought,

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.360 align:middle line:90%
damn, pick me up you guys.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm over it.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:55.150 align:middle line:10%
And then I understood that
they have their own contrast

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:56.890 align:middle line:10%
to deal with, and chaos.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.785 align:middle line:10%
We all become forgetful.

00:42:59.785 --> 00:43:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they remind
us of that all the time.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:07.120 align:middle line:10%
It's less about savages
or evil, and more just

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.712 align:middle line:10%
about forgetting
our inherent nature.

00:43:10.712 --> 00:43:12.670 align:middle line:10%
And I think that eventually,
no matter the path

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.575 align:middle line:10%
we take, our destiny
is harmony, right?

00:43:16.575 --> 00:43:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Thank you so much.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
to talk to a channeler.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.160 align:middle line:10%
You never know who you're
going to interview,

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.440 align:middle line:10%
but all the information
is fantastic.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:32.200 align:middle line:90%
