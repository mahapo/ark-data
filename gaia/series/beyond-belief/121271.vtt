[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.978 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:20.771 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.482 align:middle line:84%
We've got a fascinating
program for you today.

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.817 align:middle line:84%
We're going to deal with
the Akashic Records,

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.444 align:middle line:90%
records of your life.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.738 align:middle line:90%
It's a directory of your life.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.949 align:middle line:90%
Our special guest is Bill Foss.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.578 align:middle line:84%
Bill is an international healer,
well-known author, his book,

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
"Journey to the
Akashic Records."

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.792 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take
a look at this.

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:42.876 align:middle line:90%
>>Who are we?

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.086 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.504 align:middle line:90%
And what's next?

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:84%
These universal questions
have driven the life's work

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual teacher
Bill Foss, who

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.011 align:middle line:84%
has probed beyond physical
reality for many years

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:56.139 align:middle line:84%
to unveil what is unseen
on the astral plane.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.933 align:middle line:84%
At the forefront
of his research,

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:01.186 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic Records, containing
what has been, what is,

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.105 align:middle line:90%
and what is to come.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.274 align:middle line:84%
Known throughout history
and across cultures

00:01:05.274 --> 00:01:07.401 align:middle line:84%
by many different
names, the Records

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:10.696 align:middle line:84%
are said to provide insight into
everything from an individual's

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:14.491 align:middle line:84%
dreams, feelings, and even
death to larger world events,

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.536 align:middle line:84%
lost civilizations
like Atlantis, aliens,

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:18.495 align:middle line:90%
and much model.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.248 align:middle line:84%
Bill Foss explains how
the Akashic Records

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.293 align:middle line:84%
can unlock past and future
thoughts and actions.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.463 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, that's an
interesting background

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:28.964 align:middle line:90%
we've seen.

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:30.173 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:30.966 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, George.

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.342 align:middle line:84%
It's really good to be
here with you today.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.303 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all this?

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:36.305 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not like you
wake up in the morning

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'm going to
study the Akashic Records.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.143 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Exactly.

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:43.979 align:middle line:84%
It all started
about 20 years ago.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.108 align:middle line:84%
I was a touring musician,
professional musician,

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:55.198 align:middle line:84%
and an artist and working as
a professional artist as well.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:58.702 align:middle line:84%
And there had to be more
with all the creativity

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.912 align:middle line:90%
that I was channeling naturally.

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:04.416 align:middle line:84%
At one point, it seemed like
there was an invisible world

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.918 align:middle line:84%
attached to the other
side of the paintbrush

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.961 align:middle line:84%
with the images that
were coming through.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.632 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to know more.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I started asking God, please
show me the way it all works.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.515 align:middle line:84%
And that week, in fact
the very next day,

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I was guided to a teacher,
a special private teacher,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.439 align:middle line:84%
and books started being
put in front of me

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.983 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking
about the Records.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.445 align:middle line:84%
And I then had my
first experiences

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:34.529 align:middle line:90%
of going into the Records.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.573 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd go to like a
bookstore, and all of a sudden

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
there'd be something
on the Akashic Records,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.743 align:middle line:90%
just like looking at you?

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:40.702 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: [LAUGHING] Fly
off the shelf and--

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.454 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Calling you,
Bill, Bill, read me!

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:44.039 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.627 align:middle line:84%
My first book set was
"Life and Teachings

00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:51.338 align:middle line:84%
of the Masters of the Far
East," Baird T. Spalding,

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:54.508 align:middle line:84%
which was just a
wonderful classic study

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:57.427 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient masters on
the other side of the world.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:02.099 align:middle line:84%
And it went from that directly
into as I prayed to God,

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and I asked, I
said, please, God,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.352 align:middle line:90%
show me the way it all works.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.645 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to know.

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.897 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
what was going on

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:12.984 align:middle line:84%
as I started my, as I call
it, my re-remembrance program.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this a
life-changing event for you?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.862 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: It was.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:19.282 align:middle line:90%
When it came slowly over time.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.786 align:middle line:84%
So as I started studying,
I started re-remembering

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:29.292 align:middle line:84%
what I know to be true from my
records from past lifetimes.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:34.673 align:middle line:84%
So as I got into the records
over the course of studying

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:36.633 align:middle line:84%
the Records for
the last 20 years,

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.345 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I had been
there in between lives,

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:44.182 align:middle line:84%
working in the Records, and
also working with the Records

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:44.975 align:middle line:90%
in other lifetimes.

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:46.309 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
we've got some people

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.853 align:middle line:84%
watching the show
right now, Bill,

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.897 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying, OK, what
are the Akashic Records?

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.065 align:middle line:90%
What are they talking about?

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:52.899 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:53.733 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:59.030 align:middle line:84%
The word "askasha" translates
in several ancient languages

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and ancient texts
as "Sky Library."

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.037 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Tibetans
called it "Sky Library."

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.708 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient Egyptian,
ancient Tibetan,

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:13.253 align:middle line:84%
some other Chinese,
Lemurian, Atlantis--

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:18.841 align:middle line:84%
all of these cultures
had this akasha,

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:23.305 align:middle line:84%
this word that meant "ether"
or "air," Sky Library.

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:27.142 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic Records is
sort of like God's library

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:84%
in the higher dimensions
surrounding the planet, where

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.356 align:middle line:90%
your soul records are stored.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.942 align:middle line:84%
So everybody, you and
I and everybody else

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.446 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, 6 billion
people plus right now,

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.072 align:middle line:90%
has a book of life.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:45.034 align:middle line:84%
So it's an energetic,
etheric book of life that--

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:46.578 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The good
and the bad, right?

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.288 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, all of
your life experiences

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:53.168 align:middle line:84%
from all of your lifetimes,
past, present, future.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.587 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you've
had 20 different lives,

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:58.548 align:middle line:84%
reincarnated lives,
they're all in that record?

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Exactly-- or 20,000.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.552 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or 20,000.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:08.642 align:middle line:84%
So, when you die, does
somebody open up that book

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:11.269 align:middle line:84%
and do a review of
what you've done?

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.479 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: You do.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.271 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.732 align:middle line:84%
And there are special
teachers there.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.276 align:middle line:84%
There are teachers and
keepers of the Records that

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:25.951 align:middle line:84%
are in this library or
this school, where God,

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.827 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the
archangels, sometimes

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
family members, whatever is
perfect for the individual.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.548 align:middle line:84%
They're taken in, you look
at your lifetime, basically.

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:42.717 align:middle line:84%
You look at your most
current lifetime,

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and you get to see what all of
your missed opportunities were,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.186 align:middle line:84%
your resentments, things
you need to work on,

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.815 align:middle line:84%
and your triumphs, the things
that you've accomplished.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:06:01.236 align:middle line:84%
And because you're in the
higher dimensions at that time,

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:04.531 align:middle line:84%
you're able to see
beyond the moment.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.533 align:middle line:90%
You're able to look at the past.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.494 align:middle line:84%
And you see how this
lifetime correlates

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.162 align:middle line:90%
to your other lifetimes.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they there
in your soul state?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.335 align:middle line:84%
Are there instructors
there that tell you

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
what you did right

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.674 align:middle line:84%
and what you did wrong
with the Records?

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.052 align:middle line:84%
Or do they just
merely lay it out?

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.681 align:middle line:90%
Yes to both.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
There is really
no right or wrong.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.146 align:middle line:84%
There is greater
than and less than,

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:84%
but those don't actually
equate to right or wrong

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.401 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking
at the Records.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:47.616 align:middle line:84%
You look at your responses
to events in your life.

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:53.496 align:middle line:84%
So that being said,
they're there to guide you.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:59.252 align:middle line:84%
They're there to-- it's
really all about your soul.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:05.675 align:middle line:84%
So the Akashic Records exists
primarily for our souls,

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:09.888 align:middle line:84%
for our souls to have an
experience with our-- enjoined

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.264 align:middle line:90%
with a physical body.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:15.393 align:middle line:84%
When we go back
into soul, then we--

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:20.565 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic Records is
like a world wide web.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.902 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that the eyes are
the window to the soul, right?

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.528 align:middle line:90%
We've all heard that.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:84%
The soul is like a window
into the Akashic Records

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.493 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.244 align:middle line:90%
It can be interactive.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:41.753 align:middle line:84%
So this lifetime here, you and I
and everyone watching, everyone

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:46.007 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, we're having
an interactive experience

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.927 align:middle line:84%
with the Akashic Records
whether we know it or not.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.763 align:middle line:84%
We're connected, and we're
inputting information

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:52.555 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if in one's
life you did some things

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:90%
that you weren't too proud of?

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you change them
in the Records,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.109 align:middle line:84%
or are they there
until the end of time?

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:08.154 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: That's an
interesting question, George.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:11.574 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people that
are studying psychically

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.411 align:middle line:84%
or mystics,
practitioners, I've heard

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.872 align:middle line:84%
about people wanting to go
in and change their records.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.582 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:20.625 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:25.004 align:middle line:84%
But you want to use kid gloves
with something like that.

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:29.092 align:middle line:84%
Because if you were to go
in and change an event,

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:33.596 align:middle line:84%
you could be
changing your karma.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
It could cause a certain
other string of events

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.767 align:middle line:90%
to happen, just like--

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:41.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you change
it as if it never occurred?

00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:43.022 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: No.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so
once it's done, it's done.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.942 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Right.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.862 align:middle line:90%
Once it's done, it's done.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:52.782 align:middle line:84%
And that being said,
that experience

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.827 align:middle line:84%
for the soul, our soul
on the other side,

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:59.789 align:middle line:84%
is learning from pain,
is learning from joy,

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.417 align:middle line:84%
is learning from all
of the experiences.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:07.088 align:middle line:84%
It's having an interactive--
it's a platform of observation,

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:10.842 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it, the physical,
3D reality for our soul.

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:19.642 align:middle line:84%
That's important because when
we get back up into the Records

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.145 align:middle line:84%
and we look at those
lifetime events,

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:90%
we see what that was about.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.609 align:middle line:84%
We see what that separation
or that loss of a loved one

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.819 align:middle line:90%
was about.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With these
records-- and they've

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.242 align:middle line:84%
been going on since the
beginning of time, right?

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.202 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.411 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who records them?

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.955 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm thinking
of it in terms

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:46.336 align:middle line:84%
of there's always somebody
around to illustrate things

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.046 align:middle line:84%
and to write them
down and stuff.

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:52.759 align:middle line:90%
How did they get into this book?

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:56.304 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: When we go
into the Records--

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:84%
so if we were to do a
guided journey right now

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.936 align:middle line:84%
or to meditate, our mind
takes us in archetypally.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:06.731 align:middle line:84%
So we use archetypal
imagery to go in there.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:13.947 align:middle line:84%
The true Records-- so we often
will see a temple or a library.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:18.827 align:middle line:84%
We'll see scrolls, books, maybe
templates with soul symbols

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.621 align:middle line:84%
or energetic etheric
symbols written.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's closer to what
actually exists there.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.003 align:middle line:84%
There are ancient
Elohim-- Elohim

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
being a certain type of an
angel or an angelic being.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:40.223 align:middle line:84%
There are certain ancient Elohim
masters that watch over this.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.308 align:middle line:90%
So it's a protected place.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:47.605 align:middle line:84%
Often people will
say, I want to get in

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:51.818 align:middle line:84%
so I can find out
about this alien group,

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.779 align:middle line:84%
or I want to know what
this other government is

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.197 align:middle line:90%
doing et cetera, et cetera.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:11:00.493 align:middle line:84%
There's a self-protect
mechanism of the Records.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:03.454 align:middle line:84%
It's there primarily for
the souls of the planet

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:90%
to know who we are.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.501 align:middle line:90%
That's primary.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.336 align:middle line:84%
That's first and
foremost with it.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:13.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
access our records?

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:17.093 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: That's a great question.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:18.469 align:middle line:90%
By practice.

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:20.555 align:middle line:90%
Practice, practice, practice.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.682 align:middle line:84%
And some people
get in right away.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.934 align:middle line:84%
Some people will have
just an open experience.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.019 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it meditation?

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:26.311 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.353 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what
you mean by practice?

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:27.645 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:28.688 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.482 align:middle line:90%
Guided meditation.

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:36.321 align:middle line:84%
As we're all connected
anyway, the primary way

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:40.742 align:middle line:84%
that I teach in the
workshops is through

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:43.786 align:middle line:84%
guided meditation with
certain breathing techniques,

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:46.998 align:middle line:84%
to focus the mind,
let go, balance.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:49.834 align:middle line:84%
So you're trying to reach
that REM state, basically,

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.294 align:middle line:90%
while you're awake.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:54.881 align:middle line:84%
And we travel up
through the mental body,

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:58.551 align:middle line:84%
through the consciousness,
up through the astral plane

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:02.764 align:middle line:84%
and on up into the higher
dimensions, have an experience,

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:06.392 align:middle line:84%
then come back and see back into
the physical body and the mind.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:10.021 align:middle line:84%
This allows the person
to isolate the body,

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:16.027 align:middle line:84%
isolate the ego, go in,
look, view, learn or see,

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:16.986 align:middle line:90%
and then return.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it make
you a better person

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.531 align:middle line:90%
by accessing the Records?

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.702 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: It makes you a
more knowing person, yes.

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:27.664 align:middle line:84%
It will bring you to a
state of enlightenment.

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:30.708 align:middle line:84%
It will bring you
to-- it will inspire

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.251 align:middle line:84%
what I call moments
of enlightenment

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.461 align:middle line:90%
to start occurring.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.505 align:middle line:84%
You'll start
knowing who you are.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:42.595 align:middle line:84%
It will also-- if you practice
accessing your records,

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:45.932 align:middle line:84%
it will turn on
certain dormant parts

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.809 align:middle line:90%
of your psychic awareness.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:51.646 align:middle line:84%
Accessing the Akasha while
you're still in human form

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:55.149 align:middle line:84%
is one of the greatest
gifts that we have,

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:58.236 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest tools
that we have, bar none.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.531 align:middle line:84%
Because when you access
in the middle of your life

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:06.536 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to when you're out
of body, you're still here.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.162 align:middle line:84%
You're still here
in physical form,

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.832 align:middle line:84%
and you can start working
with your records.

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:15.003 align:middle line:90%
You can start changing.

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:17.964 align:middle line:84%
You can start really doing
some interactive, positive,

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.465 align:middle line:90%
life-changing work for yourself.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:24.429 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody
was a murderer

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:29.475 align:middle line:84%
and they tap into their
records, what would that show?

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.186 align:middle line:84%
That they've had
this horrible life?

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.397 align:middle line:84%
And how many horrible
lives have they had?

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:37.692 align:middle line:84%
Because I assume if you're
a murderer in one life,

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.318 align:middle line:84%
you've been a
murderer in another?

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.029 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it just pops up.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.655 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: [CHUCKLES] Yes.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:43.948 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:47.285 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to add to
that in answer to that

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:51.998 align:middle line:84%
and say that on a soul
level, sometimes what we do

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:58.838 align:middle line:84%
is we'll be a murderer
and then be a lover

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:05.344 align:middle line:84%
and then be a robber, then
be an accountant, then

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:09.724 align:middle line:84%
be a scientist, then be-- so the
key to answering that question

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:13.519 align:middle line:84%
or commenting on that
question, George, is, what

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.813 align:middle line:90%
is that so learning about that?

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:20.068 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously there are
some agreed-upon laws

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:22.612 align:middle line:84%
straight across the board that
says killing another person is

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:25.198 align:middle line:90%
not a good thing.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
That soul might be learning
about the higher-- experiencing

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.832 align:middle line:84%
elements of learning about life
and death and how precious life

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:37.835 align:middle line:84%
and death are or
things of that nature.

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:42.924 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, so a serial killer
or somebody of that nature

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:46.511 align:middle line:84%
can have that thing
that they repeat

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:50.139 align:middle line:84%
or loop through their records
and through their lifetimes.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:54.268 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes we'll have
the opportunity to--

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:58.022 align:middle line:84%
and we've even seen this
in a person's lifetime.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:02.151 align:middle line:84%
Let's say somebody was a
trained assassin or something

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:07.281 align:middle line:84%
or a killer, and they've
turned over a new leaf.

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.742 align:middle line:84%
They had a state
of enlightenment

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:13.371 align:middle line:84%
occur during their lifetime, and
you could now trust that person

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.497 align:middle line:90%
with your life.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:18.126 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of these people
have turned into the greatest

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.545 align:middle line:90%
humanitarians on the planet.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:23.172 align:middle line:90%
So it's all over the board.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.174 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who records your life?

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
How does it get into
the Akashic Records?

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.848 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Well, you do.

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:32.849 align:middle line:90%
You're recording.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:33.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By your actions?

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:36.978 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: By your actions,
by your responses.

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:40.648 align:middle line:84%
So it's a natural-- on the
other side, there's a matrix.

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've had TiVo long
before we had TiVo, right?

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Exactly.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.652 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.782 align:middle line:84%
On the other side,
it's a soul matrix.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:53.619 align:middle line:84%
So your soul is part
of a group of 12 souls.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.414 align:middle line:90%
There's 12 groups.

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:57.957 align:middle line:90%
There's an oversoul for that.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.917 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what do
you mean by 12 groups?

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.422 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: OK, so 12 throughout
history of sacred texts

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:07.425 align:middle line:90%
has been a sacred number.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.177 align:middle line:90%
Souls travel in groups of 12.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.264 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 12 individual souls?

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.558 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yes, 12
individual souls that can

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:90%
operate singularly or together.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.606 align:middle line:84%
So the Akashic
Records, tying this in,

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:25.109 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic Records is all
about the souls of the world.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:29.572 align:middle line:84%
That's why it exists primarily,
for the soul experiences, 12

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:32.617 align:middle line:90%
souls and an oversoul.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:37.747 align:middle line:84%
And then 12 of those groups
and an over-oversoul and then

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.290 align:middle line:84%
what they call the monad
and then all the way

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.585 align:middle line:90%
back in to God.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:46.005 align:middle line:84%
Now, each individual
soul and the oversouls

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.798 align:middle line:90%
are connected into the Records.

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:51.844 align:middle line:84%
So if we looked at it, we could
look at a template or a matrix

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.137 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:56.933 align:middle line:84%
Here in physical reality, which
is a little bit different,

00:16:56.933 --> 00:17:05.273 align:middle line:84%
we have what we call almost like
a chaotic synchronicity of when

00:17:05.273 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:84%
souls come into form
when they leave.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's a dance
more with the souls

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.906 align:middle line:90%
incarnating on the planet.

00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:16.452 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, for instance, you and
I were meant to do something,

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:84%
and we could be at opposite
ends of the planet.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.958 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reasons,
karmic-- if we had something--

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Puts it together.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.169 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yeah, we're going
to be in another country,

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:26.753 align:middle line:84%
we're going to walk
across the street,

00:17:26.753 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look at each
other, maybe open a door

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.591 align:middle line:90%
and have a conversation.

00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And then who knows
from that point?

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:36.347 align:middle line:90%
We've come back together.

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:38.891 align:middle line:84%
And there is no time
on the other side,

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:43.145 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't matter whether
we would come together and do

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:46.566 align:middle line:84%
something for a few moments,
and that could be it.

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Or we could come together and
have a lasting relationship

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:50.736 align:middle line:90%
over the rest of that life.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.614 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Show me how I
would tap into my records.

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:54.407 align:middle line:90%
What would I do?

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.492 align:middle line:90%
How would I start?

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:59.704 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: In the
workshops, George,

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.998 align:middle line:90%
we start with meditation.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:11.173 align:middle line:84%
So any form-- and I'll teach
people or share with people

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:15.469 align:middle line:90%
how to get into a quiet state.

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:18.222 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
you want to do.

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:21.642 align:middle line:84%
We have 60,000-plus
thoughts a day.

00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:24.353 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes more,
sometimes less.

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.106 align:middle line:84%
With meditation,
if you can breathe,

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.859 align:middle line:84%
if you can breathe
and slow down,

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:84%
you're going to turn on the
creative part of your mind.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.904 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Illustrate that for me.

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:35.114 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: OK.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:38.743 align:middle line:90%
So you mean just a meditation?

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:42.913 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that we use is
we'll use the 20-20 breath.

00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:44.081 align:middle line:90%
I call it the 20-20.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:47.418 align:middle line:84%
It's a pranayam breathing
technique that's

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:49.795 align:middle line:90%
part of Kriya yoga from India.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is
you count to 20 or 10

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you can do
and regulate the inhale

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.929 align:middle line:90%
and regulate the exhale.

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, usually we'll start
with 5, 10, or 15 minutes.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.351 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just do one
breath for you here.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.143 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:04.935 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:10.816 align:middle line:90%
[INHALING HEAVILY]

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:21.077 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALING HEAVILY]

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:24.288 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can actually
hear you breathe.

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.248 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:29.043 align:middle line:84%
There's a yogic
sound that you make

00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:30.211 align:middle line:90%
with the back of the throat.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.421 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But by doing
that, what's happening?

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:37.259 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: OK, multiple
things are happening.

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
There's prana, there's light
that is attached to the oxygen

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.474 align:middle line:90%
molecules in the atmosphere.

00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:45.434 align:middle line:90%
There's cosmic energy.

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:47.770 align:middle line:84%
When you regulate
the breath like that,

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:51.607 align:middle line:84%
and you do so over the
course of several moments,

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:56.946 align:middle line:84%
that prana, or that light, that
cosmic light, will find you.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:20:00.116 align:middle line:84%
It will become consciously
aware that it's being looked.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.492 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it energizes you?

00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:03.077 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, it does.

00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:08.374 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten to a point from
practicing this for years,

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:90%
it'll slow you down.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.586 align:middle line:84%
It will energize you and slow
you down at the same time.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:13.212 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
something, Bill,

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:15.923 align:middle line:84%
do you think people should do
every morning, for example,

00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:16.715 align:middle line:90%
when they wake up?

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.092 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: It's good for anything.

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:20.136 align:middle line:90%
It's good for pain relief.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
It's good for going
to sleep at night.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.224 align:middle line:84%
It's good for morning
meditation, yes.

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.435 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
forms of meditation, too.

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:31.772 align:middle line:84%
So these are all precursors
to getting into the Records.

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:35.526 align:middle line:84%
The other benefits to
any form of meditation,

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:41.365 align:middle line:84%
and most specifically to an
advanced level like this,

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:44.702 align:middle line:84%
it's very simple,
and it will give you

00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:47.163 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper
states of knowing.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:50.624 align:middle line:84%
It will give you deeper
states of relaxation.

00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:54.211 align:middle line:90%
It can clear karma for you.

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:58.007 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that
everybody wants to--

00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:01.051 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you do that,
what, 5 times, 10 times,

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.761 align:middle line:90%
each breath type?

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:05.139 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: I'll do 16,
but because I count,

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:07.725 align:middle line:84%
I use the traditional
way that the yogis did.

00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:10.936 align:middle line:84%
And we have four
creases in our fingers.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.438 align:middle line:90%
And I'll do this.

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:16.358 align:middle line:84%
But for the common layperson
or anyone that wants to start,

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:19.945 align:middle line:84%
sometimes this is
a little laborious.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.739 align:middle line:84%
You're counting, and
you're counting here.

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.491 align:middle line:90%
I'll say five minutes.

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:27.786 align:middle line:84%
Do it for five minutes and
experience what's happening.

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:30.206 align:middle line:90%
But you gotta practice.

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:31.957 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so once
you do that, you

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:37.213 align:middle line:84%
get through that stage,
what happens next?

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:38.088 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Within--

00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:39.507 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tapping
into the Records.

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:40.883 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Tapping
into the records.

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:47.806 align:middle line:84%
We have certain ways that I've
been shown to work with people

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.975 align:middle line:90%
and that I've learned.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:54.647 align:middle line:90%
And you want to sit quietly.

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.524 align:middle line:90%
The mind is powerful.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:22:04.907 align:middle line:84%
So we use the mind to
basically just intend ourselves

00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:06.784 align:middle line:90%
into the Records.

00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:09.912 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
different every time.

00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:11.872 align:middle line:84%
It can be similar
every time you go in,

00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:14.917 align:middle line:90%
or it can be vastly different.

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:19.171 align:middle line:84%
And you want to have the
experience of just sitting

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.674 align:middle line:84%
aside the time to
do it, number one,

00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:24.009 align:middle line:90%
is the most important thing.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.303 align:middle line:84%
Because then you say,
I'm going to sit down.

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:30.182 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have an experience.

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get
into the Records,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.854 align:middle line:90%
that's experience, too.

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:38.691 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
I share in the classes.

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:41.402 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there are many
people who don't access this.

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:42.194 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:44.905 align:middle line:84%
I've people come to
the workshops, every so

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:47.992 align:middle line:84%
often-- when we're
in a group of, say,

00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:53.414 align:middle line:84%
20, 50, whatever, there's an
energy field that's created.

00:22:53.414 --> 00:22:57.626 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I'll
intend a gateway or portal

00:22:57.626 --> 00:23:02.131 align:middle line:84%
into the Records so that
people can have an experience.

00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:07.136 align:middle line:84%
Every so often, 100th person
or so, somebody will say,

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:08.846 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't get in.

00:23:08.846 --> 00:23:10.848 align:middle line:84%
So we'll talk about
that, and I'll say,

00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:13.309 align:middle line:84%
there are subtle
layers of conflict

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:16.312 align:middle line:84%
that it's important for
people who don't get in.

00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:18.188 align:middle line:84%
Even if we are
used to getting in

00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:22.901 align:middle line:84%
and then we don't, we
have the reference point

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that maybe there's
subtle layers of conflict

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.743 align:middle line:84%
and-- I call it conflict,
but energy interferences that

00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:32.202 align:middle line:90%
can be in the mental field.

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:34.079 align:middle line:90%
It can be in the ego.

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:37.166 align:middle line:84%
It can be in the
eyes or the senses.

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:40.002 align:middle line:84%
The ego wants to
have the experience.

00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:43.172 align:middle line:84%
The ego also wants to
manage the soul's journey.

00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:46.342 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had
anybody emotionally break down

00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:90%
when they tap into the Records?

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.055 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they see things
that they didn't anticipate?

00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:52.681 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, yeah.

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:57.686 align:middle line:84%
That we've physical
healings occur.

00:23:57.686 --> 00:24:01.398 align:middle line:90%
We've had karmic shifts.

00:24:01.398 --> 00:24:06.445 align:middle line:84%
We've had real estate sales
happen during the class.

00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:13.077 align:middle line:84%
The emotional-- when
somebody gets in

00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:18.165 align:middle line:84%
and they see who they
really are, some people,

00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:21.293 align:middle line:84%
it's just overwhelming--
in a good way.

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:22.461 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can't take it?

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:26.215 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Well, in a good way.

00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:27.341 align:middle line:90%
They see who they are.

00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:30.594 align:middle line:84%
They see who their guides
are on the other side.

00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:32.012 align:middle line:84%
Meeting their
guides in the Record

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:34.056 align:middle line:84%
is an excellent
way to get in touch

00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:39.144 align:middle line:84%
with your personal guides,
seeing family members again.

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:45.901 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we see somebody that
we lost, a mother or a father

00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:51.281 align:middle line:84%
or a child in a
lucid way that lets

00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:55.869 align:middle line:90%
they're really present for us.

>>NOORY: When you wrote the
book "Journey to the Akashic

00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:01.542 align:middle line:84%
Records," which is a
field guide, basically,

00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:06.422 align:middle line:84%
for tapping into
your records-- I've

00:25:06.422 --> 00:25:08.716 align:middle line:84%
got to little four-year-old
granddaughter.

00:25:08.716 --> 00:25:10.926 align:middle line:84%
I assume she's got
her records, right?

00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:11.802 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:14.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And does that
clock start when she

00:25:14.805 --> 00:25:18.392 align:middle line:90%
was a baby for the new records?

00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:19.768 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:23.731 align:middle line:84%
We're also-- as a
soul, we're also

00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:27.276 align:middle line:84%
inputting at our
deepest levels of sleep

00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:29.486 align:middle line:84%
we're inputting into the
Records-- we're connectedd--

00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:30.612 align:middle line:90%
and between lives.

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:31.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unknowingly, probably.

00:25:31.905 --> 00:25:35.033 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Unknowingly,
naturally and unknowingly.

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:38.954 align:middle line:84%
We're also inputting and
connected in between lives.

00:25:38.954 --> 00:25:42.416 align:middle line:84%
So we can learn while
we're out of physical body,

00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:44.251 align:middle line:90%
and often we do.

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the
ancients and their belief

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.881 align:middle line:90%
system with these records.

00:25:48.881 --> 00:25:50.758 align:middle line:84%
Because I assume that's
where it all started.

00:25:50.758 --> 00:25:53.093 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:57.014 align:middle line:84%
One of the-- I'll
say ancient and yet

00:25:57.014 --> 00:26:01.602 align:middle line:84%
common or current
civilizations that we study

00:26:01.602 --> 00:26:02.603 align:middle line:90%
is going to be Egyptian.

00:26:06.023 --> 00:26:09.401 align:middle line:84%
And their ancestors
being the Atlanteans,

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:16.992 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians would travel
into the Akasha or the Akashic

00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:22.164 align:middle line:84%
Records through what they call
the upper openings of the body.

00:26:22.164 --> 00:26:30.214 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a syllable in
Egyptian terminology in there.

00:26:30.214 --> 00:26:34.301 align:middle line:84%
And that syllable
was art, A-R-T.

00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:39.973 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it interesting that
we perceive art or things

00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:43.769 align:middle line:84%
creative, artistic
through our senses?

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:50.734 align:middle line:84%
So the upper openings of
the body are important.

00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:53.445 align:middle line:84%
The soul is coming
through the senses.

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.155 align:middle line:90%
The Egyptians knew this.

00:26:55.155 --> 00:27:02.579 align:middle line:84%
So the high priests and
the royal class families,

00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:84%
the priests trained the royal
class families to journey,

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.044 align:middle line:84%
to connect into the
Records, and also to heal.

00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:11.213 align:middle line:90%
They were healers.

00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:14.424 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that many
people don't know, commonplace,

00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:18.929 align:middle line:84%
they look at a ruler as
being just celebrity status,

00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:22.140 align:middle line:84%
ruling over the land,
and things like that.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.311 align:middle line:84%
Many rulers over the
course of history

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:29.523 align:middle line:84%
have been great
healers and psychics.

00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:34.862 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You use this
to heal, too, don't you?

00:27:34.862 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, yeah.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:42.619 align:middle line:84%
We've had physical healing
occur in the workshops as well.

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:43.912 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And emotional healing?

00:27:43.912 --> 00:27:45.497 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:49.376 align:middle line:84%
When you continue to
go into the Records,

00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:55.883 align:middle line:84%
you naturally at the same
time access your soul field.

00:27:55.883 --> 00:27:59.052 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a
soul field around you.

00:27:59.052 --> 00:27:59.845 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:01.346 align:middle line:90%
Everybody does.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:05.267 align:middle line:84%
And when we're studying
metaphysically,

00:28:05.267 --> 00:28:09.813 align:middle line:84%
we feel the chakras, we
feel the solar plexus,

00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:11.231 align:middle line:90%
we feel the heart.

00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:15.485 align:middle line:90%
We feel on this level.

00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:18.572 align:middle line:84%
We feel the mind
or the third eye.

00:28:18.572 --> 00:28:21.325 align:middle line:84%
People feel with Reiki, or
they feel an energy field

00:28:21.325 --> 00:28:22.826 align:middle line:90%
coming from others.

00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:27.706 align:middle line:84%
The soul energy is
your true essence

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:29.583 align:middle line:90%
and has the power to heal.

00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:32.753 align:middle line:84%
It has the power to
correct everything.

00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:84%
So this is a main importance
of working with the Records.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Because the records is
all about your soul.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.887 align:middle line:84%
The soul energy is
going to be more

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:46.058 align:middle line:84%
silent than any other energy
that you're going to feel.

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:49.561 align:middle line:84%
And yet when you go
into the Records,

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:53.023 align:middle line:84%
it will start
intending itself down

00:28:53.023 --> 00:28:54.691 align:middle line:84%
through your physical
body more and more.

00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:58.153 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can somebody else tap
into someone else's Records?

00:28:58.153 --> 00:29:00.614 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you tap
into mine, for example?

00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Good question.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.326 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:07.162 align:middle line:84%
Let me answer that with
a question and say,

00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:10.248 align:middle line:90%
what is the purpose of doing so?

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Being nosy.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.793 align:middle line:90%

00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:13.961 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: I wanna know

00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:16.838 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what you did.

00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:20.175 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: I talk about that,
and a lot of practitioners

00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:22.260 align:middle line:84%
want to know that or
just common people

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:27.432 align:middle line:84%
when we come to the class
to have an experience.

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:33.146 align:middle line:84%
It's high-level information,
and everything is there.

00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:33.939 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:38.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it confidential
information to the individual?

00:29:38.527 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it sounds like you
don't want people to tap

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.074 align:middle line:90%
into other people's records.

00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:48.328 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: I don't think
it's the highest place.

00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:52.457 align:middle line:84%
I teach people to start with
tapping into their own records.

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:58.588 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little
bit, you know--

00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:01.508 align:middle line:84%
that's a little bit murky
territory when you--

00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:02.426 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Questionable?

00:30:02.426 --> 00:30:03.552 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: It's questionable.

>>FOSS: Unethical.

00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:07.681 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say, what is
your purpose for doing so?

00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:08.473 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:11.268 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To control

00:30:11.268 --> 00:30:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Somebody can.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.396 align:middle line:90%
Somebody can.

00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:16.064 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
will keep somebody

00:30:16.064 --> 00:30:20.402 align:middle line:84%
from accessing the Akashic
Records is conflict.

00:30:20.402 --> 00:30:23.405 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody has
no conflict, they

00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:29.036 align:middle line:84%
could access, to a certain
extent, another person's

00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:29.995 align:middle line:90%
records.

00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:32.581 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, I
would ask of that person

00:30:32.581 --> 00:30:35.917 align:middle line:84%
or that situation, what is
your purpose for doing so?

00:30:35.917 --> 00:30:40.422 align:middle line:84%
Because with the
amount of souls that

00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:42.758 align:middle line:84%
is interactive with
the Akashic Records

00:30:42.758 --> 00:30:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient Elohim
masters watching over it

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.056 align:middle line:84%
and the ascended masters
and the archangels

00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:52.434 align:middle line:84%
and all of their legions of
angels and God, Creator God

00:30:52.434 --> 00:31:00.067 align:middle line:84%
Himself, Herself--
there's a lot of people

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:02.652 align:middle line:90%
watching on the other side.

00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:06.239 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
be able to just get in

00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:07.574 align:middle line:90%

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:17.686 align:middle line:84%
on the other side and dimensions
and metaphysics and all of it,

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:20.355 align:middle line:84%
we know that there's a
great balance happening

00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:21.982 align:middle line:90%
between light and dark.

00:32:21.982 --> 00:32:23.525 align:middle line:84%

>>FOSS: [LAUGHING] OK.

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:05.817 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By tapping into
the Akashic Records,

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:84%
does it determine-- because
I am a strong believer

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.197 align:middle line:90%
in reincarnation.

00:33:10.197 --> 00:33:16.119 align:middle line:84%
Does it determine what your next
life would be, physical life?

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:17.245 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:18.079 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:21.625 align:middle line:90%
You can create it.

00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:84%
There are different
examples of that.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.838 align:middle line:84%
Let's say somebody had
finished all of their karma,

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:30.258 align:middle line:84%
and they were in a
really good place,

00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:32.928 align:middle line:90%
but they just loved being here.

00:33:32.928 --> 00:33:37.057 align:middle line:84%
That person, that soul,
oftentimes when they go up

00:33:37.057 --> 00:33:38.683 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking
at the records,

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:40.769 align:middle line:84%
and they're there with the
teachers or the keepers

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:43.021 align:middle line:84%
of the records,
archangels, they'll say,

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:45.649 align:middle line:84%
hey, you've learned
pretty much everything

00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:47.859 align:middle line:90%
that you need to work on.

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.236 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do?

00:33:49.236 --> 00:33:50.278 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to come back?

00:33:50.278 --> 00:33:53.782 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to come back
and play one more lifetime

00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and have good experiences?

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.619 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to come
back and help others?

00:33:57.619 --> 00:34:04.793 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, some of the
great teachers or saints

00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:06.044 align:middle line:90%
have done just that.

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:09.965 align:middle line:84%
Mother Teresa would
be an example of that.

00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:15.011 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you talk about
karma, what goes around

00:34:15.011 --> 00:34:17.138 align:middle line:90%
comes around.

00:34:17.138 --> 00:34:18.764 align:middle line:90%
What determines that?

00:34:18.764 --> 00:34:24.062 align:middle line:84%
Who's there determining what
goes around comes around?

00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:29.525 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: It's like
inputting into the Records.

00:34:29.525 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural dynamic
of cause and effect.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:37.449 align:middle line:84%
So when I use the
term "karma," I often

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:40.829 align:middle line:84%
will use cause and
effect as well.

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:45.041 align:middle line:84%
Because for every action,
there's an equal and opposite

00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:48.168 align:middle line:90%
reaction, right?

00:34:48.168 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So if we do
something, it's going

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:57.762 align:middle line:84%
to have a repercussion, whether
it's good, or in this duel

00:34:57.762 --> 00:35:01.766 align:middle line:84%
playing field, it's going to
have an interaction that's

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:05.645 align:middle line:84%
either going to be beneficial
or it's going to take away from.

00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:09.441 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was growing up
as a Catholic boy in cataclysm

00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:13.862 align:middle line:84%
classes, they always
talked about this book,

00:35:13.862 --> 00:35:17.073 align:middle line:84%
the Book of You,
the book that would

00:35:17.073 --> 00:35:19.367 align:middle line:90%
have all your records in it.

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:21.202 align:middle line:84%
Is that this, the
Akashic Records?

00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:22.746 align:middle line:84%
Is that what they
were talking about?

00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:23.788 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:24.581 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:33.298 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic Records has
translated in other religions.

00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:39.012 align:middle line:84%
Catholicism has certain
levels of mysticism within it.

00:35:39.012 --> 00:35:41.723 align:middle line:84%
So if you go up into
the higher studies

00:35:41.723 --> 00:35:47.145 align:middle line:84%
and you look at some of the
rituals, the religious rituals,

00:35:47.145 --> 00:35:50.190 align:middle line:84%
you can see that they are
based on a certain level

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.569 align:middle line:84%
of mysticism,
Christian mysticism.

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:56.696 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they all the same?

00:35:56.696 --> 00:35:59.658 align:middle line:84%
Different religions, but they
all focus in on the same thing?

00:35:59.658 --> 00:36:01.576 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Right.

00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:03.578 align:middle line:84%
They're all connected
to the same thing.

00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:08.333 align:middle line:84%
So just like all religions
have their own version of God,

00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:13.088 align:middle line:84%
but that version of God is
connected to the true God.

00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:14.506 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somewhere
along the line,

00:36:14.506 --> 00:36:17.217 align:middle line:84%
somebody needs to tell all
the religions that we're all

00:36:17.217 --> 00:36:18.635 align:middle line:90%
dealing with the same God.

00:36:18.635 --> 00:36:19.469 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Exactly.

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because As they act
like it's someone different.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:22.972 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Exactly.

00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:23.765 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:33.358 align:middle line:84%
In writing the book and in
teaching workshops, the more

00:36:33.358 --> 00:36:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to go
into our own soul records

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.572 align:middle line:84%
and see who we are, if
somebody gets in just and just

00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:44.285 align:middle line:84%
gets a glimpse of
who they are, it

00:36:44.285 --> 00:36:48.665 align:middle line:84%
can change their
outlook on their family,

00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:51.876 align:middle line:90%
physical reality, their life.

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:53.753 align:middle line:84%
Once they're in that
soul energy and they

00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:56.631 align:middle line:84%
look at their self in the
mirror, they look at their soul

00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:59.509 align:middle line:84%
through that mirror,
through that reflection,

00:36:59.509 --> 00:37:02.929 align:middle line:84%
it can change how they
feel about God, too.

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:05.974 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the most powerful--

00:37:05.974 --> 00:37:08.476 align:middle line:84%
is one of the simplest
things that we learn early on

00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:10.812 align:middle line:90%
in religion, connecting to God.

00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:15.442 align:middle line:84%
And as you go in and you do
this work, when you really,

00:37:15.442 --> 00:37:19.654 align:middle line:84%
really can start connecting
more and more to your creator,

00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:22.574 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the most
powerful relationships

00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:25.076 align:middle line:90%
that you can ever achieve.

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:28.413 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So by the breathing
meditation in the beginning,

00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:31.082 align:middle line:90%
that gets you into a state.

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:34.586 align:middle line:84%
Then what's your next step
to access the Records?

00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:39.549 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Continue
setting time aside.

00:37:39.549 --> 00:37:43.052 align:middle line:90%
Just make it a regimen.

00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:48.766 align:middle line:84%
Disciplining yourself to
sit down and get quiet

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:51.060 align:middle line:84%
for some people is one
of the hardest things.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, does it just
come to you automatically

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.106 align:middle line:90%
at a certain time?

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.525 align:middle line:90%
You want to allow.

00:37:57.525 --> 00:38:00.487 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, for
instance, George,

00:38:00.487 --> 00:38:04.324 align:middle line:84%
if we were going to sit down
every morning at 8:00 AM

00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:07.327 align:middle line:84%
or every night at 10:00
when we go to sleep,

00:38:07.327 --> 00:38:08.495 align:middle line:90%
say, I'm going to practice.

00:38:08.495 --> 00:38:09.287 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not me.

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.205 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the air then.

00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:13.082 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: [LAUGHING] You are.

00:38:13.082 --> 00:38:15.627 align:middle line:84%
Somebody would say, I'm going
to practice for 15 minutes.

00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:17.337 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to set
aside this time.

00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:21.174 align:middle line:84%
Then naturally their
psyche, their subconscious

00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:24.886 align:middle line:84%
would start programming so that
they would go in at that time.

00:38:24.886 --> 00:38:28.139 align:middle line:84%
So you can pick up
some momentum that way.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:31.184 align:middle line:84%
The main thing is just
to continue practicing,

00:38:31.184 --> 00:38:34.604 align:middle line:84%
to intend into the
Records, to intend

00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:36.606 align:middle line:84%
with the mind and
the subconscious.

00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:40.360 align:middle line:84%
The superconscious, conscious,
and the subconscious parts

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.739 align:middle line:84%
of your mind intend into
that which you're already

00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:49.202 align:middle line:90%
connected with and allow.

00:38:49.202 --> 00:38:52.247 align:middle line:90%
Allow is a big word.

00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:56.543 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
tell someone who would say,

00:38:56.543 --> 00:38:59.087 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about
the Akashic Records.

00:38:59.087 --> 00:39:01.464 align:middle line:84%
All I care about is
my life right now

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:03.424 align:middle line:90%
on good old planet Earth.

00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:05.552 align:middle line:84%
What do you tell
somebody like that?

00:39:05.552 --> 00:39:07.136 align:middle line:90%
Can you get to them?

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: You can.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:17.272 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody has dreams
and some mystical experiences

00:39:17.272 --> 00:39:20.275 align:middle line:84%
that they're not sharing
with the rest of the world.

00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:27.073 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the people that are
like just earthbound, good,

00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:30.493 align:middle line:84%
old-fashioned--
their spirit guides,

00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:35.164 align:middle line:84%
they don't believe in that,
even these people have

00:39:35.164 --> 00:39:40.712 align:middle line:84%
synchronicities happen or
things that make them think.

00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:42.338 align:middle line:84%
One of the big
things that I find

00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:45.925 align:middle line:84%
with people in general, the
old-fashioned people that

00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:47.802 align:middle line:84%
don't want to go
into metaphysics,

00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.929 align:middle line:84%
they know there's
more out there,

00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:51.723 align:middle line:84%
but if they go into
that, it's going

00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:53.516 align:middle line:84%
to open up a whole
new playing field,

00:39:53.516 --> 00:39:56.185 align:middle line:84%
and some people just
aren't willing to go there.

00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.729 align:middle line:90%
However, they will get there.

00:39:57.729 --> 00:40:02.984 align:middle line:84%
So let's say somebody who
doesn't believe in spirit

00:40:02.984 --> 00:40:05.987 align:middle line:90%
guides or doesn't believe in--

00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:08.031 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there are
many out there that don't.

00:40:08.031 --> 00:40:09.449 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:12.535 align:middle line:84%
So that person, in
their moment of passing

00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:16.080 align:middle line:84%
when the veils move back and
time is in the eternal moment

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.958 align:middle line:84%
and they're crossing
over, they might

00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:21.669 align:middle line:90%
look over and say, who are you?

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:23.379 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:40:23.379 --> 00:40:26.007 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a family
member or an angel.

00:40:26.007 --> 00:40:28.301 align:middle line:84%
They'll know that
person right away.

00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:30.637 align:middle line:84%
But it could be
startling for them.

00:40:30.637 --> 00:40:36.893 align:middle line:84%
These people usually have a lot
of conflict, a lot of conflict

00:40:36.893 --> 00:40:40.021 align:middle line:90%
that is built up in the ego.

00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:44.776 align:middle line:84%
And the ego is the
lower part of our mind

00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:49.781 align:middle line:84%
and our heart, our core
self, that wants to control

00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:51.616 align:middle line:84%
or needs to be
right about the ways

00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:55.453 align:middle line:90%
that we view physical reality.

00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:57.914 align:middle line:84%

By tapping into the

00:41:04.504 --> 00:41:08.174 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: It's good
to make a list.

00:41:08.174 --> 00:41:12.387 align:middle line:84%
Make a list of the things

00:41:12.387 --> 00:41:14.722 align:middle line:90%
You're in a balance place, OK?

00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:17.725 align:middle line:84%
So you want to intend,
which is you're

00:41:17.725 --> 00:41:20.520 align:middle line:90%
looking for certain things.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.313 align:middle line:90%
And you want to allow.

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:24.440 align:middle line:90%
So you want to see new things.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.485 align:middle line:84%
You want to see things
that you don't normally

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:31.114 align:middle line:84%
see in the here and
now on this side.

00:41:31.114 --> 00:41:36.202 align:middle line:84%
So you might look for,
are there any karmas

00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:37.286 align:middle line:90%
that I need to work on?

00:41:40.123 --> 00:41:44.502 align:middle line:84%
And that can show you natural
events of this lifetime.

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:48.589 align:middle line:84%
We get so layered
up from the time

00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:53.136 align:middle line:84%
that we're small when we're
kids up through our lives.

00:41:53.136 --> 00:41:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have so many
experiences continually,

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.266 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we had an
interaction with somebody

00:41:58.266 --> 00:42:03.521 align:middle line:84%
that we don't remember that
left a scar for that person

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:08.234 align:middle line:84%
or that created a chasm
between the two people.

00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:11.362 align:middle line:84%
And you when you go
into the Records,

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:13.906 align:middle line:84%
maybe they'll show
that to you right away.

00:42:13.906 --> 00:42:15.074 align:middle line:90%
It can be that simple.

00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:19.746 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing how
it can change your life just

00:42:19.746 --> 00:42:25.376 align:middle line:84%
by the meditation, the breathing
exercises and I guess quietly

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:28.796 align:middle line:84%
just thinking of your
lives and what you've done.

00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:29.881 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yeah.

00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:36.804 align:middle line:84%
It really is, in my opinion,
one of the most powerful things

00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:39.015 align:middle line:84%
that you can have
access to work with.

00:42:39.015 --> 00:42:40.558 align:middle line:90%
And you have it.

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:41.517 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all do.

00:42:41.517 --> 00:42:41.893 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's right there.

00:42:41.893 --> 00:42:43.144 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: We all have it.

00:42:43.144 --> 00:42:53.404 align:middle line:84%
And when you get into viewing
and you see more and more,

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:57.533 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have the ability
to see things that are just

00:42:57.533 --> 00:42:59.452 align:middle line:90%
going to inspire you to no end.

00:42:59.452 --> 00:43:03.706 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're brave enough
to look into your past lives,

00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:08.377 align:middle line:84%
your souls, who you
were, who you will be,

00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:12.548 align:middle line:84%
you might want to journey
to the Akashic Records.

00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:14.133 align:middle line:84%
Bill, thanks for
being on the program.

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:14.967 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:17.136 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Thank you, George.

00:43:17.136 --> 00:43:21.724 align:middle line:90%
