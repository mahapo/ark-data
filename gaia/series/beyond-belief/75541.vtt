00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.634 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
back to this edition

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
In our last edition,
we were talking

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:10%
with Kelly S. Jones
about feng shui

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.850 align:middle line:10%
and how it affects people,
both in their energy levels,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:10%
their relationships.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:10%
You name it, it works.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:10%
We're talking with her now about
her latest work, the "Akashic

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:10%
Records Soul Dialogues."

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Kelly, welcome
back, first of all.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY S. JONES: Thank you.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.254 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always
good to have you.

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:90%
What are the akashic records?

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I've heard so many stories
about these things.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: I like to
actually walk somebody

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:10%
through their imagination,
and even sometimes close

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:10%
their eyes to imagine a field.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:10%
And it's a field of which all
potential and all possibility

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:10%
exists.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And we are in it.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:10%
We are them, and they are in us.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And many people get confused
with the word "records."

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And they think
it's literally a record.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.839 align:middle line:90%
But this field--

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's in
the hall of records.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Records.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:84%
It's been referred to
as the hall of records,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
the library of light, the mind
of God, God's remembrance.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:84%
There's many ways that
they are referred to.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And they hold what we would
call our past, present,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:90%
and potential future.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's because we are
here in linear time,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And we've agreed to this
time-space continuum that

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.062 align:middle line:84%
says well, there is a
past, there is a present,

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and there's the future.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But where these records
reside, we could say,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.090 align:middle line:84%
is really in the eternal
now, in the present moment.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And so there is no past.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:90%
There is no future.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:10%
There is only now.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is this what
they tried to teach us

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:10%
in my Catholic catechism classes
years ago, that when you die

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:10%
there's a book, there's a
record of everything you did?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Is that what the
Akashic records are?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Indeed.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible actually refers
to it as the "book of life."

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And every spiritual tradition
has a way of referring to them.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're really there
for us to keep track of,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and to know our own personal
growth and transformation.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we are our
living records.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have a divine
right to know them,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:90%
and to access them at any time.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.040 align:middle line:10%
I just happen to do it
in a way that allows,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:10%
with one's permission, me to go
into and actually communicate

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:10%
with masters, teachers, and
loved ones of the individual.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:10%
So they, in essence, are
working in tandem with me

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:10%
to bring forth the
wisdom, the insight,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:10%
the guidance that is there.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.884 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once the records are
done, can you change them?

00:03:09.884 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Indeed.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can they be altered?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Yes.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:90%
We rewrite our records--

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take out the bad stuff.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.196 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: All the time.

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, and how we do
that is by shifting

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:84%
the matrix of our
perception, of that which

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
we perceived as
having experienced.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if I
look back in childhood,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.560 align:middle line:84%
or somebody's
experience in childhood,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.706 align:middle line:84%
to say what was my
mother or father doing,

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:90%
or what were they thinking?

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:84%
What was the truth of their
behavior and their actions?

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And when that information
is brought forward,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
the energetic space within
one's being-ness shifts.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
They have a whole new
perspective and understanding

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:84%
of what transpired,
let's say, in childhood.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And in that, the records,
their perception, is rewritten.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Truth has been revealed.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And they know it.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
There's an internal
feeling that says yes.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there everything
in there, the good and the bad?

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: And the ugly, yes.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:10%
So what they say
is it's a recording

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:10%
of our every thought,
word, deed, and action.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Every thought?

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.027 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Every thought,
yes, even thoughts.

00:04:14.027 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Yes.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:10%
And individually
and collectively.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.266 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They
didn't tell me that.

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:20.071 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:10%
Oops.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: Yeah.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:10%
And it's an amazing field
that nothing bypasses.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Everything gets recorded.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:90%
So everything is known there.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's there to
be in service to us.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not to have
judgment about it.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting, even
when we said thoughts,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:84%
there's a sense of uh-oh, do
I need to be worried about it?

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, the
beings that I work with,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.540 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic masters
and teachers,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
they reside in a field of
complete love and non-judgment.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:10%
And so there's nothing
that we can ever say or do

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.031 align:middle line:10%
that there is--

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:01.072 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They won't take
fault with you, I guess.

00:05:01.072 --> 00:05:01.572 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: Never, never.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:10%
And in fact--

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's unusual.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Even when they--
well, because they're

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
in the dimension
of the heart, which

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
is where the records
actually are.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So the closer we get, and
align with the true essence

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
of our being, the heart of
who we are, and we drop out

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.480 align:middle line:84%
of the mind, which
wants to think it

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:84%
knows, and figures it out, and
bow to the heart of our being,

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:84%
then we can bring forth the
greater wisdom of the heart

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:90%
to every life situation.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kelly, how soon in
one's life do they start,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:90%
a little baby?

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:90%
When?

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So it's really
since we decided, as soul,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:90%
to individuate from source.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.487 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that could
be almost at any time.

00:05:43.487 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: The records
are always there.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:10%
And so it's called the
recording of our soul's journey

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:10%
through lifetimes.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:10%
So it's every lifetime
that we've experienced.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
what you're speaking

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:84%
to might be a little
different, which

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
has to do with innocence,
which has to do with--

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pure innocence.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: The truth of
who we are, exactly.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we overlay, shall we
say, the personality or the ego,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:84%
which begins to judge or mask
the pureness of who we are.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And we start being conditioned
by the human condition.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we're learning
to do is actually

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:90%
unlearn the human conditioning.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we can access the Akashic
records, which brings forth

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that wisdom that assists us in
understanding even the deeper

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
pieces, or the lessons
that we came here to learn.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:90%
And so those are vital.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're important
to our soul journey.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And they're recorded
in the records, as well.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell me about your
work "Akashic Records Soul

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.637 align:middle line:10%
Dialogues" again.

00:06:45.637 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:10%
What does this mean?

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:10%
What's this all about?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: That's, I've done a
group with my partner, Doug,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:10%
for a couple of years now,
where we had a gathering of what

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:10%
we call kindred spirits.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'd open the records
of the entire group.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And we created different
subjects and topics

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:84%
to talk about on
a monthly basis.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And so there would be Q&A,
questions and answers,

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that would be brought
forth from the audience

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
that the Akashic records
and the masters and teachers

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:90%
responded to.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, I like that.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So this
became a transcript.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:10%
I call it a down to Earth
enlightenment handbook.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.490 align:middle line:10%
So there are 116
different topics actually,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:10%
and eight divine opening
meditations in there.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And it just assists
us in relating

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
to different everyday
questions that we all

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:84%
experience, from
relationships, shame, judgment,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness, to what's
happening in the economy,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and the world at
large collectively.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's a nice composite.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can people
read their own records?

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Indeed.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without
dying to get there?

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Indeed.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you do that?

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Indeed.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
ways, if you will,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that we actually
access our records.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And some, it might be deja vu,
dreams, hypnosis, iridologists,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:90%
palm readers, astrologers.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So there's many different
modalities to access.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I use one that allows
me to, actually

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:84%
it's been scientifically
shown to alter my brain wave

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:10%
And so when we even go
into deep relaxation,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:10%
when we go into
meditative states,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:10%
we afford ourselves the
opportunity to avail to us

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:10%
more of the heart
of who we are, more

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:10%
of our own internal being-ness,
which is our Akashic records.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:10%
It's in our DNA.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:10%
And to-- when we move
even from the beta,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.230 align:middle line:10%
the active awake state,
to the alpha and theta,

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:10%
more information is allowed in.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So it is a accessing of other
dimensional information,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
subconscious,
super-conscious, soul level,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:90%
to be available to us.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is the
avatar of forgiveness?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: That was one of
the Akash fills we did.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.900 align:middle line:10%
It's what we call our gathering.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was a deep
exploration, if you will,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.850 align:middle line:84%
of this idea of
forgiveness, and what it is,

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and how we can do it,
and the truth of it,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:90%
and how it unveils for us.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate truth is
there's nothing to forgive.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But we often sit
in a place of well,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:84%
how do I forgive
when I don't feel

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:90%
like being forgiving, even?

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And one of their answers was you
desire more joy in your life.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:10%
So it's answers like
that, and insights

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:10%
like that that they often
bring forth in experiences.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sometimes
forgiveness is difficult.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I can forgive people
for a lot of things.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:10%
I could not forgive somebody
who would, let's say,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:10%
intentionally go out and
hurt or kill someone,

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:10%
especially if I knew
that other person.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.912 align:middle line:10%
Is there something wrong
with me that I don't forgive?

00:09:52.912 --> 00:09:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>>JONES: Well, I
certainly wouldn't

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:10%
say there's anything
wrong with anybody.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the answer to
that question is no.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is recognizing
that the truth of who we are

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:90%
is not the murderer.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, one was
not in their right mind

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:90%
when that choice was made.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we're able and capable
to see beyond the part that

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:84%
made that choice
and decision, to see

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:84%
the light of the
being-ness that is there.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we all
actually are, always have been,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:90%
and always will be.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened
is that one has

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.125 align:middle line:84%
forgotten the light
that they are.

00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We're
going to come back

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.624 align:middle line:10%
in just a moment on "Beyond
Belief," where Kelly S.

00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:10%
Jones will provide us with an
Akashic records consultation.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.617 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:10:43.617 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't go away.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:10%
Hey, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.800 align:middle line:10%
Kelly S. Jones,
our special guest

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:10%
as we talk about
the Akashic records.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:10%
And we have another
Kelly with us,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:10%
because Kelly
number one is going

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:10%
to be telling Kelly number two
about her own personal records.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.699 align:middle line:90%
Kelly, take it away.

00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Thank you.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Kelly.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.055 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Hello.

00:11:10.055 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Great, thanks.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.491 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Wonderful.

00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:90%
So your records are open.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:10%
And who I communicate with are
your Akashic records masters,

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.000 align:middle line:10%
teachers, and loved ones.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:10%
And so is it OK if I
share with you some

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:10%
of the information that's
actually coming through?

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes I actually have
the client ask a question,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.313 align:middle line:90%
but I'm receiving information.

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: I'm ready.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Are you ready?

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.033 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: OK.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So I look up, also, to
receive that information.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And so here's what
they're sharing.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
They're saying,
dear one, welcome

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:90%
to your grand transformation.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.840 align:middle line:84%
You are undergoing,
shall we even say,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:84%
a planetary alteration
within your being-ness

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
that is manifesting in the
physical form in a way that

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.010 align:middle line:84%
is unique, new, and
different for you.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.910 align:middle line:90%
And so it is unfamiliar to you.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And because it's unfamiliar,
it is causing a disturbance,

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, in
your energy field.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:90%
So it may feel unbalancing.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.610 align:middle line:84%
It may feel as if it's,
you're ungrounded and looking

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:90%
for balance and stability.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It is a lesson, shall
we say, to understand

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
what is held in this
field of uncertainty.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Because within this uncertainty,
you are looking to find,

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
within the heart
of your being-ness,

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.121 align:middle line:90%
your certainty of being.

00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing me that
you do work with clients where

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
you assist them very
much in the same way

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are speaking
of here now.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And it is through that
modality and this experience

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
that you are coming to
recognize what they experience.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And unless you know
it, it is hard for you

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:90%
to have compassion for it.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So in your traveling the same
footsteps that they travel,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.280 align:middle line:84%
can you actually bring
them to a new place

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:84%
that you are finding
within yourself,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that you know they
hold within them?

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And in that balance
and stability,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and the trust of their
presence, their soulful self

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:84%
guiding them, you can
share that with them.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.427 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense to you?

00:13:27.427 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, definitely.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.387 align:middle line:90%
Can I ask a specific--

00:13:30.387 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Sure.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Around that?

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.199 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I dissolved my
business a couple months ago

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
around a certain aspect
of guiding people.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And I've been pretty frustrated
the last couple of months

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:84%
without feeling that there's
a lot of new direction.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to
know what they have

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.729 align:middle line:84%
to say about
rekindling my passion.

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:52.004 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Hm.

00:13:52.004 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting, the
first thing they're sharing

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
is there's a judgment about
not having the passion.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's being in
resistance of what is.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet what is, is
the opportunity for you

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:84%
to find peace and harmony,
and balance within that state.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So as you do, as you
allow what is to be--

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's an acknowledgement,
shall we say.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:84%
It is not that you
have to accept it,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.010 align:middle line:84%
or-- nor will it stay
and remain this way.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
actually asking is,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:84%
how do I realign my
inner being, not only

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
to know this experience so
that I can be a guide for it

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:90%
to others in this experience.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:84%
What can I do to further
enhance my knowing-ness of what

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:84%
is of passion to me in my
next evolution of being-ness,

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
of sharing my talents
and gifts to the world?

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's see, what is the most
important thing that Kelly

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:90%
can do at this time?

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a re-emergence.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
What's important for you is
to re-emerge into the work

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:90%
that you've actually been doing.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not about leaving it,
letting it go, nor ignoring it.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.830 align:middle line:84%
It's about opening that book
again, and looking in it,

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and finding in there what
jumps out, what speaks to you

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
more prominently now,
that didn't before.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
There's so many nuances,
facets to this gem

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:90%
that you offer the world.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And you took off on one
aspect of it in the past.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Now it's time to pick
up a different aspect.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's within
you that you will

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
find what that is in
your-- it's funny,

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
they're saying in
your book of life.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But they're also saying
that you have a book.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And so in your own
book, there are--

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
it's about helping people
understand how to start anew.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.730 align:middle line:84%
What is new on their journey
that they have to offer,

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
that they want to explore,
that's new and different?

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have had a
blessing in the sense

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
that you've kind of
had a lot of your life

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
laid out before you.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you actually see the
multi-facets of what is.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Whereas others that
come to you have

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:84%
seen certain aspects,
but not others.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And so because you
see greater, you

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.675 align:middle line:84%
know how to move
into that newness.

00:16:17.675 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And so what you're
doing is helping them

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:90%
in the transitions.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So you're experiencing this
to experience a new transition

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
so you can help walk them
from point A of the unknown,

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.881 align:middle line:84%
a facet they can't see, but you
can help them see on top of it.

00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: I get it.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
very frustrated,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and wondering why
I'm so frustrated.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But OK, so I hear
them saying to me

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
that is so I can have the
experience of frustration

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.022 align:middle line:90%
to relate to my audience.

00:16:46.022 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Exactly.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Relate to my clients.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:48.518 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Exactly.

00:16:48.518 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So you know their
experience personally.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're also creating the
bridge of light, shall we say,

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:84%
between where you're at and
your own anew expression, which

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:90%
for you is not far from you.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But for clients, it could
be farther for them.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you can
help sort of-- it's

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
like they're showing
me a flashlight.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a flashlight
lighting the path.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And that flashlight
allows them, and you,

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
to see what's that next
step, and to encourage

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
them to put that next step,
one in front of the other,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
in front of the other, and trust
and know that that path is laid

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
before them, and is solid,
and available to them.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Can they
give me one next step?

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: They asked
you, open the book.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Open your book.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.486 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Open my book.

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Open your book
and ask to be shown.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: My next step.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.651 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Yes.

00:17:38.651 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they've said
it and will repeat it.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How will
that step come to her?

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Will it be an epiphany, or what?

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So what
it is, is you will

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.361 align:middle line:84%
be finding clients
who are starting anew.

00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: OK.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: That's the next step.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.240 align:middle line:90%
That's who you're finding.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: OK.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: That's who you're
drawing to you and connecting.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: OK.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Does that make sense?

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.209 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Yeah, in and
of itself, that is--

00:17:59.209 --> 00:18:00.875 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: That is the
next step, exactly.

00:18:00.875 --> 00:18:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: OK.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:01.649 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:01.649 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Exactly.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the who am I
in service to now?

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I've been in service
to this group,

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:12.480 align:middle line:84%
doing this aspect, this
facet of the gem of myself.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I have served
humanity in this way.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Now there's another gem.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
There's another facet that I am
coming to bring light through,

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:90%
to be in service from.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: OK.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: But I need to know it,
and experience it, and embrace

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.925 align:middle line:84%
it fully in order to be
able to say, I get you.

00:18:29.925 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I understand what
you're going through,

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and I know the steps
of which to take

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
to get where it is that I
can see and help you get to.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: So I let
go of my judgment,

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:90%
because it's different.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Well, because--

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: This is
different for me.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not--
yeah, I'm just kind

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:84%
of freaking out
because it's different.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Indeed it is.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: OK.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Indeed it is.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kelly, do the
records show Kelly's future?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: So it shows the
potential and the highest

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:90%
probability.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what just came forth
for her was in direct response

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:90%
to her intention to know.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
there's an unfoldment.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I can hear, sense,
see, feel, know

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
what it is her divine
beings of light are guiding

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
her to know from
her own records.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And here's how it relates
and how she can specifically

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:90%
understand and relate to it.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And not just at a mental
level, but a heart level,

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:90%
does it feel right?

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Does the information align
within the being-ness of you,

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:23.744 align:middle line:90%
that it feels right?

00:19:23.744 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Yeah, it moved me
from a state of confusion

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and frustration to peace
and calm, actually.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.857 align:middle line:90%
It kind of dropped something in.

00:19:30.857 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Which, maybe if we're talking
about the Akashic records,

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
it's the part of me that might
be just feeling that truth.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.871 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Yes, exactly.

00:19:38.871 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
anything in the records

00:19:41.078 --> 00:19:43.795 align:middle line:90%
you didn't know were in there?

00:19:43.795 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Based on
what she just shared?

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Let's just say it's
like I have the door ajar to it

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:90%
on my own path, by my own self.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But what she just brought
forth made it 100%.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:84%
It brought it to
deeper clarity for me,

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.790 align:middle line:90%
and that helps me relax.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think there would be
a sense of confirmation

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:90%
that it brought me.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:03.890 align:middle line:90%
I know it did.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it was really
beautiful, actually.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I can rest
into-- it sounds

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:84%
like there's an underlying
theme, like surrender to me.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And what I call it
is opening doors of light.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And so those doors of light
can be, yes, confirmation,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:90%
clarification.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's
brand-new information

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.224 align:middle line:90%
hadn't thought about.

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Not sure you thought
about the potential

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of a different type
of clientele that

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.746 align:middle line:84%
is looking to create
anew in their own life.

00:20:30.746 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So for me that might have been
a bit of new information--

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: That is also
confirming who she is

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:90%
and where she's coming from.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:90%
So the records, it depends.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the person.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Every session is different,
where everybody is

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:84%
is different, their desire
to know, their need to know,

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.044 align:middle line:90%
and their openness to know.

00:20:49.044 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody
have the ability

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
to change the outcome
of their records?

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: Well, we're
always in the now moment.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're always
at a choice point.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're always creating,
shall we say, our records.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So we can change what's
been created, again,

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.670 align:middle line:84%
as I shared before, when
we shift our understanding

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and our perception of
our past experience.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Kelly
might be-- could

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:84%
be, she's not-- but she
could be in judgment

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.875 align:middle line:84%
of how her life has
been going, right?

00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JONES: And then let's say her
masters and teachers brought

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:84%
forth to say,
Kelly, well, here's

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:84%
why everything that's been
happening to this point

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:90%
has been happening.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's bringing
you into a point that

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
allows you to understand
your clientele better.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So you needed these
life experiences.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:10%
You needed to move into
the heart of compassion

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:10%
so that now you can
be fully present

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.401 align:middle line:10%
and do what you came to do in--

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And you're
prepared for it.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Exactly.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kellys, thank you
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Thank you.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JONES: Thank you.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:48.901 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wasn't that something?

00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:10%
Akashic records, your
future, soul dialogues.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:12.767 align:middle line:90%
