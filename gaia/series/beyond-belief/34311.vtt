>> George Noory: And
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.193 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all have
psychic abilities,

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:29.529 align:middle line:84%
but there are some people
who have psychic abilities

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.798 align:middle line:90%
that are way broader than ours.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.501 align:middle line:84%
Let me introduce
Victor Paruta to us.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.203 align:middle line:90%
Hey, the world-renowned psychic.

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.304 align:middle line:90%
How are you, Victor?

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Victor Paruta: Good
to see you, George.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.673 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Good to see you, too.

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:44.044 align:middle line:84%
You know when you do psychic
work, how does that come to you?

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Victor Paruta:
In a number of ways.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.381 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a multisensory
experience

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:50.083 align:middle line:90%
when I do readings for people.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.718 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.387 align:middle line:90%
We all do have psychic abilities

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:56.156 align:middle line:84%
and they all happen
in different ways.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.191 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you exactly
how I do a reading.

00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:58.992 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: All right.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Victor Paruta: I sit

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.262 align:middle line:84%
down with the client
and I close my eyes.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.565 align:middle line:84%
I start getting initial
impressions just

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:09.002 align:middle line:84%
through my mind's eye,
through my inner imagery.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:13.473 align:middle line:84%
And usually during those first
few moments when I'm tuning

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:17.511 align:middle line:84%
into somebody, I tune into
their essential issues

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:19.112 align:middle line:84%
and I know what's
going on with them.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.949 align:middle line:84%
And then when I open my eyes
and I start looking at them,

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:23.884 align:middle line:90%
I start reading their auras.

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:27.321 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at their auras,
I can see in different parts

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.424 align:middle line:84%
of their energy fields
different types of information.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.759 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You remember
the Edgar Casey story of auras.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
He was getting on an elevator
in a high-rise building,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and the door opens and he
sees several people in three,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.003 align:middle line:90%
and he always can read auras.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:44.571 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't see anything.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.872 align:middle line:90%
He panicked he backed out.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:50.544 align:middle line:84%
The elevator apparently
snapped and those people died.

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:51.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Victor Paruta: Yes.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.147 align:middle line:84%
And he did that because all of
their auras were gray or black.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.349 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Victor Paruta: So he
knew that they would die.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:02:00.253 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, if he had not
followed his intuition --

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.388 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: He
would've been one of them.

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:02.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Victor Paruta: -- he
would been one of them,

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:03.857 align:middle line:84%
and the world would've
had a great loss.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Victor, how'd you get
involved in psychic work?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.897 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: You know, George, growing
up, I grew up in Cleveland,

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:14.768 align:middle line:84%
Ohio, regular middle-class
family,

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:17.371 align:middle line:84%
went through school,
went to church.

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.674 align:middle line:84%
None of that stuff
ever seemed to pop.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:21.908 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Pop?

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:25.545 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: It wasn't "the thing"
that made sense to me.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:28.548 align:middle line:84%
I picked up a book
by one of the --

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:31.985 align:middle line:84%
by a clairvoyant at a
used bookstore called

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:38.058 align:middle line:84%
"The Inner Life," and I read
that and my world opened up.

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:40.961 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Did you train yourself?

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:42.095 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: You know what?

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a destiny
thing with me, George.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.768 align:middle line:84%
When I was 14 or 15 --
and by the way, teenagers,

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:51.038 align:middle line:84%
young teenagers like that
often start becoming psychic

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know
what's happening.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.743 align:middle line:84%
I started having a series
of precognitive dreams.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Those were dreams
that were very vivid,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.616 align:middle line:84%
and then within the
next week or two,

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:08.622 align:middle line:84%
the dream would happen precisely
as I dreamt it in my real life.

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.358 align:middle line:84%
This just started
happening spontaneously.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.227 align:middle line:90%
I didn't try for this to happen.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:16.863 align:middle line:84%
And it just caused me to
start questioning things.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.832 align:middle line:84%
I thought, how in the
world could this happen.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:22.002 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, I
dreamt this two weeks ago.

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.905 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later it's
happening in my real life.

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:27.307 align:middle line:84%
When it started happening,
it was as if I was

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:90%
in a video of my dream.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it sort of -- I
started questioning time.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.948 align:middle line:90%
I started questioning reality.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.017 align:middle line:84%
I started doing a
little more research.

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:40.353 align:middle line:90%
And it just started my quest.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:43.457 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did it scare you at
all that you had this ability?

00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:44.691 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: It didn't scare me.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:90%
And you know what, George?

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.363 align:middle line:84%
At that time I don't think
I would've called myself

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:51.465 align:middle line:90%
a psychic.

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.767 align:middle line:84%
I didn't call myself
a psychic until I was

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.936 align:middle line:90%
in my late 20s or early 30s.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.905 align:middle line:84%
But I was in a meditation
group led by a psychic,

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.707 align:middle line:90%
Alan Ramsey in Cincinnati --

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:01.942 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh, sure.

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:04.277 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- and he predicted;
he said, "You know what?

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.178 align:middle line:84%
One day, Victor, and it
won't be long from now,

00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:08.815 align:middle line:84%
you'll be doing readings
just like me."

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:11.351 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "You know, no way.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:84%
No way will I ever
be doing readings."

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.222 align:middle line:84%
A year and a half
later there I was --

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:16.056 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Doing readings.

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: -- I was doing readings.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.792 align:middle line:84%
I started doing professional
readings.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:21.895 align:middle line:84%
And at that time I was
doing them for free.

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:23.763 align:middle line:90%
But people kept coming back

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:84%
because the readings were
accurate and my career started.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.569 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You do the tarot
cards to, don't you?

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:30.971 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yeah.

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:34.674 align:middle line:84%
I started with cards, and then,
you know what happens is just

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:35.775 align:middle line:90%
like your dream life,

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.078 align:middle line:84%
those images are
coming from somewhere.

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:40.046 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it's coming
from the spirit.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:44.251 align:middle line:84%
What you need to develop as a
language which forms a bridge

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:47.087 align:middle line:90%
between spirit and yourself.

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:49.356 align:middle line:84%
You know, just like if you
need to speak to somebody

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:53.326 align:middle line:84%
who speaks French, you need
to learn the French language,

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.761 align:middle line:90%
there's a psychic language.

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:59.432 align:middle line:84%
The psychic language is a
language of symbols, sensations,

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:02.636 align:middle line:84%
it could be physical
sensations, pictures,

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:08.108 align:middle line:84%
and all the five physical
senses are extended

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:09.709 align:middle line:90%
into invisible realms.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.346 align:middle line:84%
So you don't just see with your
eyes, you see with your mind.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:16.983 align:middle line:84%
You don't just hear with your
ears, you hear with your mind.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.853 align:middle line:84%
And through a series
of peak experiences,

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
certain abilities
just blossomed forth.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.693 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Now, we haven't rehearsed
any of this, but I want you

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:30.831 align:middle line:84%
to utilize me as a client
who wanted to see you

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.633 align:middle line:84%
about some kind of
psychic reading.

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:35.502 align:middle line:90%
Let's use me.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.037 align:middle line:90%
Do what you do.

00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:39.639 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Well, my very first
impression of you, George,

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.008 align:middle line:84%
is that you've got
a great talent

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:49.482 align:middle line:84%
for being smooth sailing
during very high stress times

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:90%
and situations.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.185 align:middle line:84%
I think you're very
good at that.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:56.223 align:middle line:84%
I think you've got an inner
source of peace and balance

00:05:56.223 --> 00:06:00.026 align:middle line:84%
that you can tap into, almost
like the eye of the hurricane.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:03.129 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that serves
you really quite well.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.399 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do I know I'm doing this
or does it just come naturally?

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.636 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: You probably know
you're doing it, I would say.

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're a professional.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.539 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Maybe I trained
myself to do this.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.907 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Probably.

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:16.643 align:middle line:84%
Well, you trained yourself to
be an excellent interviewer.

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:20.847 align:middle line:84%
People need training in any
career that they would choose.

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:22.782 align:middle line:84%
If you're somebody who
wants to be a psychic

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:25.719 align:middle line:84%
and they have some natural
gifts or natural abilities,

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.022 align:middle line:84%
the way to train yourself
is to start paying attention

00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:33.727 align:middle line:84%
to your dreams, learn
dream symbology,

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.564 align:middle line:84%
learn to decode those dreams,
learn a divination system

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.866 align:middle line:90%
like astrology or tarot cards.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:44.371 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times in America
those things are diminished

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:48.074 align:middle line:84%
by the public opinion,
but they're very profound.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:53.046 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's ever studied the
tarot deck actually represents a

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:56.182 align:middle line:84%
soul's journey throughout
their lifetime.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:58.051 align:middle line:90%
So it's very profound.

00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:03.156 align:middle line:84%
And all of the planets in
astrology are archetypal forces

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:05.859 align:middle line:90%
that are active within ourselves

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:09.029 align:middle line:84%
and within our planet
in different ways.

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.698 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand what
the planets represent,

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:84%
the energies they
present, and the houses

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.969 align:middle line:90%
and the horoscope are simply

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:22.442 align:middle line:84%
where those energies take
place, where they happened.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.779 align:middle line:84%
This sort of knowledge
expands your mind.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:26.846 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What are people
interested

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:28.782 align:middle line:84%
in when they want
psychic readings?

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:32.052 align:middle line:84%
Are they looking for
relationship, jobs?

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:34.220 align:middle line:84%
What do they want to
know about their future?

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.924 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: People -- life is hard,
you know, so people need advice

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:40.727 align:middle line:84%
about making choices,
making decisions.

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:43.763 align:middle line:84%
I happen to be pretty good at
relationship dynamics issues.

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:45.365 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of couples' readings.

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:49.336 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people come for
past-life information.

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:50.837 align:middle line:84%
They have questions
about the future.

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:55.675 align:middle line:84%
But these days I'd say probably
most of my clients are coming

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:57.911 align:middle line:90%
in for mediumship sessions.

00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:00.413 align:middle line:84%
People are coming
in to communicate

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.982 align:middle line:84%
with loved ones who've
crossed over.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:06.886 align:middle line:84%
And that's a gift that I
developed spontaneously.

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:12.892 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine died, and the
night of his memorial service,

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:16.596 align:middle line:84%
he came to me, and I didn't even
know was him but I was inspired

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:18.431 align:middle line:84%
to call a common
friend of ours --

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.433 align:middle line:90%
the three of us were very close.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:23.268 align:middle line:84%
And I picked up the phone, I
dialed -- I dialed my friend,

00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:90%
he picked up the phone.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Joe, I do not
know why I'm calling you,"

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.143 align:middle line:84%
and all the sudden, Carl
started speaking through me,

00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:31.744 align:middle line:90%
the message was loud and clear.

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:32.545 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: So you channeled --

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.747 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: It was unmistakable.

00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:38.818 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And after the
message was spoken, I said,

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.653 align:middle line:90%
"Well, I guess I'm done.

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.455 align:middle line:84%
See you tomorrow
at the funeral."

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:45.058 align:middle line:84%
You know, so it was a
very profound experience.

00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:47.594 align:middle line:84%
But I call that a
peak experience.

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:49.396 align:middle line:84%
It was something that
happened spontaneously.

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:50.797 align:middle line:90%
It was profound.

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:52.031 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget it.

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:56.069 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, it
opened a window in my mind

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:58.671 align:middle line:84%
that has remained
opened ever since.

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:01.241 align:middle line:84%
So ever since that
experience, I've been able

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:02.876 align:middle line:90%
to do mediumship readings.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:06.446 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you ever get
bothered by the spirit specter?

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:09.182 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they come at you
because they know you're one

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:13.019 align:middle line:84%
of those communicators that
you can pass on their messages

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.087 align:middle line:84%
and things that they're
probably --

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:15.221 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Once in a while, George.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:15.855 align:middle line:90%
Once in a while --

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.123 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Too much?

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.425 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- that does happen
-- no, it's not too much.

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately for me, through
the course of my training

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.362 align:middle line:90%
and experience, I've learned how

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:26.399 align:middle line:84%
to turn psychic abilities
on and off at will.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.401 align:middle line:84%
But I get so many
calls from people

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.371 align:middle line:84%
who where the psychic
abilities have just flipped on,

00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:34.674 align:middle line:84%
the switch stays on, and
they hear dead people,

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:38.945 align:middle line:84%
there are so many that it
becomes very confusing to them.

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:42.849 align:middle line:84%
I got a call from a
university professor;

00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:45.785 align:middle line:84%
a student of hers came
up to her after class

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:48.488 align:middle line:84%
and described dead people
that she saw around her.

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:51.524 align:middle line:84%
This student did
not know what to do,

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:56.463 align:middle line:84%
but whenever she started seeing
dead people, she felt compelled

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:59.032 align:middle line:90%
to provide that message.

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:02.302 align:middle line:84%
That student called me, and I
comforted her, and I told her,

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:03.436 align:middle line:90%
"You're a psychic medium.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.271 align:middle line:84%
The gift just happened
spontaneously,

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:08.141 align:middle line:84%
it happened quickly,
it happened suddenly.

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:09.242 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift.

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:11.411 align:middle line:84%
You'll learn how to
control it over time,

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:90%
but for now just go with it."

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.249 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the information
does come

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:19.385 align:middle line:90%
in in a shockingly sudden way.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:21.354 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes
I'll see something

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:23.356 align:middle line:84%
and I'll shake my head,
and I'll look again

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:24.791 align:middle line:90%
and it won't be there.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.494 align:middle line:84%
But I find out that what
I saw in my mind's eye

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:31.464 align:middle line:84%
so vividly is a future
occurrence.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.366 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, you know, I was
going to say, like the movie the

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
"Sixth Sense," where the little
boy says, "I see dead people,"

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.641 align:middle line:84%
do you, too, see them
or do you feel them?

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.845 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: I see them in my mind's
eye, and I've also seen them

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:48.081 align:middle line:90%
with my physical eyes.

00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:51.084 align:middle line:84%
And when I do sessions
in front of groups --

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:54.287 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of group readings
in front of large groups --

00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:55.655 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.957 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- I do see them pop
out of the audience and they're

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:02.795 align:middle line:84%
with their loved ones and
they have messages for them.

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a beautiful
experience.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.565 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It really is.

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:06.933 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And I think it's
a beautiful experience

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
because you get to see a lot
of love and feel a lot of love

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.173 align:middle line:90%
from dead people to the living,

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.042 align:middle line:84%
and it's very comforting
for everybody.

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:18.444 align:middle line:84%
It's very comforting for the
dead person because they get

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:21.114 align:middle line:84%
to communicate to their
loved ones and reassure them

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:25.318 align:middle line:84%
that they're okay; and
obviously, it's very comforting

00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:27.387 align:middle line:84%
for the living person
because they know

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:29.522 align:middle line:84%
that the dead person
still exists

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.991 align:middle line:90%
and is around them indeed.

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's always different.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.963 align:middle line:84%
You know, one thing
about this line of work,

00:11:36.963 --> 00:11:40.266 align:middle line:84%
nothing ever gets boring
because every single client

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:41.234 align:middle line:90%
that comes to me --

00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:42.368 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It's changing
all the time.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.903 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: It's a different
story every single time.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:45.538 align:middle line:90%
It's a different situation.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:49.075 align:middle line:84%
Every time I do a paranormal
investigation, for example,

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:52.111 align:middle line:84%
it's a completely
different thing going on in

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:53.146 align:middle line:90%
that particular place.

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:55.782 align:middle line:90%
So it's an adventure.

00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:56.616 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:57.917 align:middle line:90%
And it's a learning experience.

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.687 align:middle line:84%
And I considered being
a professional psychic a

00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:02.322 align:middle line:90%
spiritual path.

00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:05.825 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a spiritual path, it
teaches you a lot of things

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:12.665 align:middle line:84%
about human beings, about
life, about what it takes

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
to lead a happy life, what's
important, what isn't important,

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.773 align:middle line:84%
and it provides you with
a lot of heart compassion

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:22.942 align:middle line:84%
for what people go through
on a day-to-day basis.

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:25.044 align:middle line:90%
Because you know, we never know.

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:28.281 align:middle line:84%
You know, we might envy
somebody who's famous,

00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:30.717 align:middle line:90%
for example, or wealthy.

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:32.719 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know
until you get a glimpse

00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:35.288 align:middle line:84%
into the private life what they
go through on a daily basis.

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:37.056 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of those people
aren't really happy.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:39.892 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure. And some of them are
struggling with mental illness,

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:84%
some of them are struggling
with huge financial crises

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.232 align:middle line:84%
and people think that
they've got it made,

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:48.935 align:middle line:84%
but they have no idea the
pressure they're under.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:51.704 align:middle line:90%
So you know, it's interesting.

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:54.941 align:middle line:84%
So you shouldn't judge
a book by its cover.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.311 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Tell me a little bit
about the dark forces that are

00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:00.279 align:middle line:90%
out there in the psychic world.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:04.317 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: A lot of people don't
like to tackle this topic

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:08.521 align:middle line:84%
but I've seen them, you know,
what we call "demonic entities,"

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:10.289 align:middle line:84%
and I've got a lot of
information about it,

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:13.926 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to go ahead and
give you what I've seen, okay?

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.061 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: All right

00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:16.396 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Not too long ago,

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:19.465 align:middle line:84%
one of my very best friends
had a serious heart attack.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.301 align:middle line:84%
He called me -- he
lives in Santa Fe --

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.505 align:middle line:84%
and he told me what happened
to him, and he asked me

00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:90%
to do a psychic read on it.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.544 align:middle line:84%
Here's what I saw: I saw
two beings around him.

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:32.578 align:middle line:90%
One was an angel --

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:33.913 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: After-the-fact, right?

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:36.683 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: This was after his heart
attack and he had survive.

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:40.319 align:middle line:84%
I saw -- he wanted to know what
happened and what would happen.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:43.289 align:middle line:90%
I saw an angel and -- who was

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.557 align:middle line:84%
with him throughout
the whole process,

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:46.459 align:middle line:90%
but I saw another being.

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:50.697 align:middle line:84%
That being looked like what
we think of as a little devil.

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:51.531 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh.

00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:53.132 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: But it wasn't the devil.

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:56.069 align:middle line:84%
It was an earth elemental,
you know.

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:58.071 align:middle line:84%
And these are beings
that live in the earth,

00:13:58.071 --> 00:13:59.972 align:middle line:84%
they're associated
with minerals.

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:02.742 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times at psychic
conventions when you see people

00:14:02.742 --> 00:14:06.212 align:middle line:84%
who sell crystals
and gems and stones,

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:09.348 align:middle line:84%
I'll see these beings
around them.

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:11.417 align:middle line:84%
They look kind of
like gargoyles.

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:12.618 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Okay.

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:18.858 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: But their job is to
take flesh after it dies

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:22.962 align:middle line:84%
and turn it back into earth;
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.097 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: So they're not that evil?

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:24.964 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: They're not evil.

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.165 align:middle line:90%
This one isn't evil.

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:90%
This one isn't evil.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.768 align:middle line:90%
There are evil ones.

00:14:28.768 --> 00:14:33.906 align:middle line:84%
But when I saw that, I realized
that that was probably mistaken

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:38.845 align:middle line:84%
by early Christian writers
as a demon or a devil --

00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:39.812 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- it was
an earth elemental.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.517 align:middle line:84%
I see demons and devils around
people who are struggling

00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:50.256 align:middle line:84%
with drug addiction, and I also
see demons around people who are

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:52.925 align:middle line:84%
about to do something
malevolent --

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:53.626 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Okay.

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: -- hurt somebody.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.394 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: All right.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:56.863 align:middle line:90%
What a barometer that is, huh?

00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:58.064 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yes.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.732 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen that, you
know, right before they're

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.734 align:middle line:84%
about to hurt somebody,
for example.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.536 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Or rob someone
or do something stupid.

00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Exactly.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.074 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's the question
of, which came first?

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.575 align:middle line:90%
The chicken or the egg.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.912 align:middle line:84%
Did the demon cause this
person to go that way,

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:17.183 align:middle line:84%
or did that person's intention
to do harm call in the demon?

00:15:17.183 --> 00:15:18.551 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:21.187 align:middle line:84%
I was also in San
Francisco a few years ago

00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:23.923 align:middle line:84%
and visiting a friend
that I met in college

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.525 align:middle line:84%
who I hadn't seen
for many years.

00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:28.127 align:middle line:84%
And I just happened to be
the out there on business,

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:29.528 align:middle line:90%
and he invited me to --

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:32.899 align:middle line:84%
called him up and he
said, sure, come on over.

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:35.535 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to me,
he and his group

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:38.204 align:middle line:84%
of friends had gotten
into drugs.

00:15:38.204 --> 00:15:41.641 align:middle line:84%
Not only had they gotten into
drugs, they were doing rituals

00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:43.476 align:middle line:90%
of some sort, and they asked --

00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:44.544 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Satanic?

00:15:44.544 --> 00:15:46.145 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: They didn't
think it was satanic.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.548 align:middle line:84%
You know, our minds
can be easily deluded.

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:53.085 align:middle line:84%
So they started doing a
ritual, and what I saw was

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:59.125 align:middle line:84%
out of the earth, these spirals
came up, and they were spirals

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:03.596 align:middle line:84%
of negativity, and they were
pulling these people down.

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:05.331 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Bad juju as we'd call it.

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.332 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Bad.

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:07.667 align:middle line:84%
The dark forces don't
care about life.

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:09.368 align:middle line:90%
They don't care about you.

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:12.972 align:middle line:84%
And through drugs and things
like that, they just --

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You open yourself
up, don't you?

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.708 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yes.

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:18.678 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
take away your life

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:19.645 align:middle line:90%
and move on to the next guy.

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: They want to soul?

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.148 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Right.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
nothing good about them.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And I also see demonic forces
around very negative situations.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:35.094 align:middle line:84%
I think that some other job --
or their purpose in the world is

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:39.065 align:middle line:84%
to weave webs of negativity
which keep people ensnared

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:43.135 align:middle line:84%
or trapped, either
through mental thoughts

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:90%
of limitation, anger, discord.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.143 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to
break up those webs

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:55.181 align:middle line:84%
through using crystal grids
and other sorts of clearings.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.183 align:middle line:84%
I happen to be pretty good
at clearing negative energy

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:01.086 align:middle line:90%
out of people and out of places.

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:04.856 align:middle line:84%
And once you break up that
energy, it tends to fall apart

00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:07.559 align:middle line:84%
and the web is released
and things are returned

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:10.263 align:middle line:90%
to a more comfortable state.

00:17:10.263 --> 00:17:13.932 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Victor, I'm fascinated
by the evil that is associated

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:16.102 align:middle line:90%
with this kind of energy.

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a believer that you have
the positive and the negative.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.475 align:middle line:90%
It balances out, doesn't it?

00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:24.243 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: It sounds like you
believe in it, too, don't you?

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.044 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely.

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.245 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: The dark forces
are at work in this world.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.147 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes.

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:28.648 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yeah.

00:17:28.648 --> 00:17:29.482 align:middle line:90%
And so --

00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sometimes on overtime.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.318 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Absolutely.

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:34.387 align:middle line:90%
And it's very insidious.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:37.857 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes you have
no idea, but, you know,

00:17:37.857 --> 00:17:39.392 align:middle line:90%
you mustn't give in to it.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:43.462 align:middle line:84%
I think that what might be
missing in our school system

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:46.432 align:middle line:84%
or educational system
is a certain level

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:48.668 align:middle line:84%
of character training
or character development

00:17:48.668 --> 00:17:50.303 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't necessarily --

00:17:50.303 --> 00:17:51.704 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Good point.

00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- go in -- it doesn't
need to go into a religious sort

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.911 align:middle line:84%
of dogmatic sort of angle, but
simply character development,

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:01.581 align:middle line:84%
what you do, how
you treat people,

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.282 align:middle line:90%
how you live a good life.

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:05.785 align:middle line:84%
And I think if people
were trained better,

00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:08.688 align:middle line:84%
they would be able to
avoid certain pathways

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:11.924 align:middle line:90%
that lead to bad things.

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.159 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: When you investigate,

00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:16.162 align:middle line:84%
let's say a haunting,
what do you look for?

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:20.666 align:middle line:90%
How do you start?

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:21.934 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Okay.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.502 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You walk into the
house, do you feel right away?

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.339 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Sometimes I'll get a call
for a paranormal investigation,

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:28.708 align:middle line:84%
somebody's having
problems in their home.

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:30.743 align:middle line:90%
And they know it's happening

00:18:30.743 --> 00:18:32.478 align:middle line:84%
because their lives
are falling apart.

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:34.347 align:middle line:90%
You know, they can't sleep,

00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
there's relationship
difficulties,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.051 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of problems.

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:40.286 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Negative,
negative, negative.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.554 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yes.

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:43.723 align:middle line:84%
And so we schedule an
appointment for me to go out.

00:18:43.723 --> 00:18:47.994 align:middle line:84%
Usually days ahead of that,
I start getting impressions

00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:49.962 align:middle line:90%
on what's going on there.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:53.866 align:middle line:84%
And when I do arrive, on my
way there, I pay attention

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:56.769 align:middle line:84%
to impressions that I'm
receiving psychically.

00:18:56.769 --> 00:19:00.439 align:middle line:84%
But what I like to do when
I arrive at a location,

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:02.742 align:middle line:84%
is I like to take a
look at the building.

00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.744 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you show up
in a little dark bag --

00:19:04.744 --> 00:19:06.946 align:middle line:90%
[ laughter ]

00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:08.347 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Not quite.

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:12.785 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a regular guy here, not
a priest or anything like that.

00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:16.222 align:middle line:84%
But what I like to do is I
like to look at the building.

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:20.326 align:middle line:84%
The building in a haunted
situation seems alive.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:23.496 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it seems like
it's looking back at you.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:28.401 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes haunted places,
when you're on the way there,

00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:84%
the spirits don't
want you to get there,

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.105 align:middle line:90%
so they'll get you lost.

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:34.607 align:middle line:90%
Your GPS will stop working.

00:19:34.607 --> 00:19:37.209 align:middle line:84%
It will take you
down the wrong path.

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:38.544 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:39.345 align:middle line:84%
Well, they figure you're going
to get rid of them, right?

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:40.246 align:middle line:90%
They don't what you around.

00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:40.946 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Exactly.

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:43.249 align:middle line:90%
So they try to block it.

00:19:43.249 --> 00:19:44.717 align:middle line:90%
But let's say you do get there.

00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:45.918 align:middle line:90%
You look at the house.

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:48.921 align:middle line:84%
I walk in, I like to go
into the main entrance.

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.756 align:middle line:90%
I start feeling energies.

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:52.925 align:middle line:90%
I feel the energies on my body.

00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:56.695 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the body is an
excellent psychic receptor.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.698 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It sure is.

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.032 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Yeah, you get
those feelings in the pit

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.368 align:middle line:90%
of your stomach, you get chills.

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:04.503 align:middle line:84%
You've got to pay
attention to that.

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:06.138 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's got that.

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:10.042 align:middle line:84%
Being psychic is not unusual
because God made you that way.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:10.876 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.011 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: There's the third eye.

00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:13.479 align:middle line:90%
There's -- 95 percent

00:20:13.479 --> 00:20:15.581 align:middle line:84%
of our decisions are
actually made intuitively

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:19.552 align:middle line:84%
because we don't ever seem
to have all the facts.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:23.689 align:middle line:84%
So I walk in, I walk
throughout the place.

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.057 align:middle line:90%
What I really like to do

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:29.729 align:middle line:84%
in certain places is make a
connection with a good spirit

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:34.033 align:middle line:84%
that there and get
information from them.

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:35.634 align:middle line:84%
And once I establish
that connection,

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:37.436 align:middle line:90%
I can get the true information

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.105 align:middle line:84%
about what actually
occurred there.

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:42.341 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Have you been into a
situation where it was just

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.344 align:middle line:90%
so overwhelmingly bad --

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:48.714 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to dwell on the
dark all during this program --

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:52.218 align:middle line:84%
but can you feel that
almost instantly?

00:20:52.218 --> 00:20:52.918 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yes.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.186 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: The bad stuff?

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.321 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yes.

00:20:55.321 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Within the past year, I
did do an investigation,

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.793 align:middle line:90%
and it was this little family.

00:21:00.793 --> 00:21:03.896 align:middle line:84%
It was this a single
mother and her three kids,

00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:06.732 align:middle line:84%
living in a house
kind of in the burbs,

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:10.703 align:middle line:84%
and all of them were
experiencing various levels

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:12.238 align:middle line:90%
of paranormal illness.

00:21:12.238 --> 00:21:15.107 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that I'm
researching right now and I plan

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:18.577 align:middle line:84%
to write an article or
a book on it here soon.

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:22.481 align:middle line:84%
Paranormal illness:
Missing time,

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:25.751 align:middle line:84%
you're fatigued all the time,
you can't remember anything,

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:90%
you know something's wrong,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.523 align:middle line:84%
you're just dragging
yourself through each day.

00:21:30.523 --> 00:21:31.924 align:middle line:90%
I was talking to the kids.

00:21:31.924 --> 00:21:34.193 align:middle line:90%
I went from room to room.

00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
What they were experiencing
there were very malevolent,

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:42.968 align:middle line:84%
nonphysical, nonhuman entities
that came from somewhere else,

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:47.339 align:middle line:84%
but these entities were
draining these people's energy

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:49.575 align:middle line:90%
on a daily and nightly basis.

00:21:49.575 --> 00:21:53.712 align:middle line:84%
The youngest of the kids was
even experiencing some symptoms

00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that might be considered bipolar
or, you know, mentally ill,

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.586 align:middle line:90%
you know, personality disorders.

00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:05.257 align:middle line:84%
But I saw that, you know, and
in that particular location,

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:09.862 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it was a
mixture of extraterrestrial,

00:22:09.862 --> 00:22:13.933 align:middle line:84%
subterranean -- these are beings
that live in the earthy --

00:22:13.933 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and those beings had
infiltrated this house --

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.339 align:middle line:84%
and they were renting
the house --

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:24.143 align:middle line:84%
and every night when
these people were asleep,

00:22:24.143 --> 00:22:28.814 align:middle line:84%
these beings would come to
them and drain their energy.

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:30.883 align:middle line:84%
And who knows what
else they did.

00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:32.017 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And they'd
wake up exhausted.

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.919 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: They would
wake up exhausted.

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:36.889 align:middle line:90%
Their lives, they were in a fog.

00:22:36.889 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
In that particular situation,
I decided not to attempt

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.063 align:middle line:84%
to do a clearing and
I asked the mother

00:22:44.063 --> 00:22:45.197 align:middle line:90%
if they were on a lease or not.

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:47.132 align:middle line:84%
It was like they
were month-to-month.

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:49.868 align:middle line:84%
And the remedy was to
move and to move fast.

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Far away.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.105 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And that's
exactly what they did.

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:54.873 align:middle line:90%
They moved, and last I heard,

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:55.741 align:middle line:84%
they were doing much,
much better.

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:56.642 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Good point there.

00:22:56.642 --> 00:22:57.743 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yes.

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:59.912 align:middle line:84%
However, I have been
able to clear situations

00:22:59.912 --> 00:23:01.847 align:middle line:84%
that at first I thought,
you know,

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:04.316 align:middle line:90%
this is too big to deal with.

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:07.786 align:middle line:84%
But using crystal
grids, using energies,

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:10.623 align:middle line:90%
doing my clearing rituals,

00:23:10.623 --> 00:23:17.329 align:middle line:84%
I was able to clear the negative
energies out of the building.

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:20.132 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: The late prophet
Edgar Casey, I think,

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:22.501 align:middle line:90%
died because he would take

00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:25.771 align:middle line:84%
in all this energy
in his trance state.

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:29.508 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people would come
to them, they'd be sick,

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:33.112 align:middle line:84%
he'd talk about that, and I
think he absorbed a lot of that.

00:23:33.112 --> 00:23:35.681 align:middle line:84%
Does that happen to you
when you go to these events?

00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you leave
physically wiped out, exhausted?

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.023 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: The way it happens to
me is -- yes, that does happen.

00:23:44.023 --> 00:23:47.693 align:middle line:84%
But the way it happens to me
is, when I'm doing readings

00:23:47.693 --> 00:23:50.763 align:middle line:84%
at events, so where I'm
doing a lot of readings,

00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:54.033 align:middle line:84%
I get on a psychic high, you
know, and at the end of the day,

00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:56.235 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I can do anything.

00:23:56.235 --> 00:24:00.806 align:middle line:84%
But within about a half-hour,
my energy starts to step down,

00:24:00.806 --> 00:24:03.242 align:middle line:84%
and I realize I'm coming
back down to earth.

00:24:03.242 --> 00:24:05.377 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've learned
is not to go shopping

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:06.979 align:middle line:90%
when I'm in that high state.

00:24:06.979 --> 00:24:08.681 align:middle line:90%
I can't say no.

00:24:08.681 --> 00:24:09.682 align:middle line:90%
I'm too open.

00:24:09.682 --> 00:24:10.883 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:24:10.883 --> 00:24:11.984 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: You know, it's
like, yeah, I'll buy that.

00:24:11.984 --> 00:24:14.887 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. [Chuckle] So I
don't do them anymore.

00:24:14.887 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But and then I -- by
the time I step down,

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.292 align:middle line:84%
I end up going home
and going to bed.

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.493 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But you have
to protect yourself.

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:23.896 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Well, working
psychics need

00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
to develop a certain
set of psychic skills.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.036 align:middle line:84%
You need to learn how
to ground energy out.

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:33.939 align:middle line:84%
You need to know how to
cleanse your aura out.

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:36.108 align:middle line:84%
You absolutely have
to take breaks.

00:24:36.108 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
You can't be doing
this 40 hours a week.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.777 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: No.

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:39.578 align:middle line:90%
It's too much.

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:40.279 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: You'll get exhausted.

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:41.313 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's too much.

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:43.615 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: I do readings
three days a week.

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:45.017 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's good pacing.

00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:46.652 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And you've got
to maintain yourself.

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:84%
You've got to exercise and
eat right and all that.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You are constantly
busy doing all of this,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.262 align:middle line:84%
and like you say, you
do it for three days.

00:24:57.262 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
But I would guess that that may
be three days of physical work.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.404 align:middle line:84%
But I think your brain
is moving 24/7, isn't it?

00:25:05.404 --> 00:25:06.372 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Oh, sure.

00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And I get calls all
the time, too.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.143 align:middle line:84%
But I love doing this work
because I love helping people.

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:14.246 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Give me an example
of a house that you've been

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:17.449 align:middle line:84%
to that had this
kind of negativity

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:20.119 align:middle line:90%
around it and what do you do.

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:22.821 align:middle line:84%
What do you do to these people
to beyond telling them to move?

00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:25.491 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they end up
staying, what do you do?

00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:26.859 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Well, I'll you,

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:32.731 align:middle line:84%
the secret to healing not only
paranormal issues but a lot

00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:36.769 align:middle line:84%
of other issues, is to --
if it remains invisible,

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:40.072 align:middle line:84%
if you don't see it, you
can't do anything about it.

00:25:40.072 --> 00:25:42.841 align:middle line:84%
But if you can see what's
going on, just the fact

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:46.078 align:middle line:84%
that you see it, it starts
to shift a little bit.

00:25:46.078 --> 00:25:48.647 align:middle line:84%
When I do clearings, let's
say I'll see an attachment,

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:52.251 align:middle line:84%
a spirit attachment on
somebody, I basically focus

00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:55.854 align:middle line:84%
on that attachment and focus
all my mind power on it

00:25:55.854 --> 00:26:00.058 align:middle line:84%
with an intention to clear it,
and I ask for the assistance

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:84%
of my spiritual allies,
which are angels and guides,

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:09.368 align:middle line:84%
and I've got various other
guides that do the work for me,

00:26:09.368 --> 00:26:14.473 align:middle line:84%
and through working or
partnering up with my helpers,

00:26:14.473 --> 00:26:15.941 align:middle line:90%
they basically do the work.

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:17.576 align:middle line:90%
I just kind of set it up.

00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:19.011 align:middle line:90%
I set it in motion.

00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you can see
it, you can heal it.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.514 align:middle line:90%
So if you can see it --

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:23.615 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Good motto.

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:26.552 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: That's a great
model, and it works.

00:26:26.552 --> 00:26:27.886 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It is dangerous for some.

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:31.657 align:middle line:84%
Is it dangerous for the person
at the house if they stay

00:26:31.657 --> 00:26:35.828 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of environment and
don't tap into someone like you

00:26:35.828 --> 00:26:37.596 align:middle line:90%
but they merely just stay there?

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:40.032 align:middle line:90%
Can something happen to them?

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:41.099 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Well, at the very least,

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:44.336 align:middle line:84%
the quality of their
life is compromised.

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:47.172 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people who
do not believe in the work

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:51.877 align:middle line:84%
that I do and the topics
that we talk about here,

00:26:51.877 --> 00:26:55.681 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
be stubborn about it.

00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:59.785 align:middle line:84%
But if they were honest
about it, they would know

00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:01.186 align:middle line:90%
that something's a little wrong,

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:02.688 align:middle line:84%
they just don't want
to look at it.

00:27:02.688 --> 00:27:05.357 align:middle line:84%
If they don't look
at it, you can't --

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:08.927 align:middle line:84%
it can't be shifted,
it can't move.

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:12.564 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, bad things
can happen to people

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:14.766 align:middle line:84%
who are living in
haunted locations.

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, I recently
got a call from somebody.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.140 align:middle line:84%
They moved into a haunted house,
she and her fiance and her kids

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.375 align:middle line:90%
from a previous marriage.

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did they know
about this moving in?

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.013 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: They did not know
that the house was haunted.

00:27:28.013 --> 00:27:30.916 align:middle line:84%
But not long after
they were in there,

00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:34.019 align:middle line:84%
one night the fiance
just was gone.

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:35.454 align:middle line:90%
He'd moved out.

00:27:35.454 --> 00:27:36.421 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't handle it.

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:37.256 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Wow.

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:39.691 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: And this poor woman is --

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.393 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Left her?

00:27:41.393 --> 00:27:42.361 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Left her.

00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:44.296 align:middle line:84%
Gone. -- is left
there with her kids.

00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:47.466 align:middle line:84%
The kids are afraid to go
upstairs -- up the stairs --

00:27:47.466 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's where it is.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.102 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- because
that's where it is.

00:27:50.102 --> 00:27:54.006 align:middle line:84%
They're all sleeping in the
living room, and it's a very --

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Get out of the house.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.542 align:middle line:90%
Move.

00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.744 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: It's not a -- it's not
the way anybody wants to live.

00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:02.814 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do some of these entities
follow you from place to place?

00:28:02.814 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: People can be
haunted as well as buildings

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.588 align:middle line:90%
and as well as objects.

00:28:09.588 --> 00:28:14.026 align:middle line:84%
And I have had beings
follow me home.

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:16.361 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the work of a
psychic medium, you know,

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:18.730 align:middle line:90%
we've got a psychic aura,

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.433 align:middle line:84%
and spirits can tell
that we're mediums.

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:25.237 align:middle line:84%
Now, once in a while when I go
out partying with my friends,

00:28:25.237 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
a spirit will follow
me home, and usually --

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.275 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Which makes for a more
interesting party [inaudible].

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:32.477 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Well, I don't know.

00:28:32.477 --> 00:28:36.281 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, I'm sensitive, and
so I'll get home and it's like,

00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:38.417 align:middle line:84%
hmm, you know, something
is not right.

00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:39.985 align:middle line:90%
I'm not feeling right.

00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:42.588 align:middle line:84%
I usually will sit down and
go into a state of meditation

00:28:42.588 --> 00:28:44.423 align:middle line:84%
and I'll realize,
oh, my goodness,

00:28:44.423 --> 00:28:46.024 align:middle line:90%
somebody followed me home.

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:49.127 align:middle line:84%
What they're actually
doing is asking for help.

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:53.098 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do
is send them home.

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:57.836 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes dead people
get lost after they die,

00:28:57.836 --> 00:29:00.105 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
how to go to heaven.

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:03.241 align:middle line:84%
If they were bad during their
lifetimes, they don't want

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.277 align:middle line:84%
to go heaven because --
or they don't want to move

00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:07.179 align:middle line:84%
on because they're
afraid they'll go

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:08.814 align:middle line:90%
to hell instead of heaven.

00:29:08.814 --> 00:29:09.448 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:09.982 align:middle line:90%
Which is possible.

00:29:09.982 --> 00:29:10.749 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yes.

00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:12.718 align:middle line:90%
So they remain earthbound.

00:29:12.718 --> 00:29:16.989 align:middle line:84%
And those -- I've encountered
those entities at various hotels

00:29:16.989 --> 00:29:19.157 align:middle line:84%
that I've stayed at, you
know, where I can't sleep

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:20.759 align:middle line:84%
and I've woken up
during the night

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:24.296 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen them just tapping
into me, draining my energy.

00:29:24.296 --> 00:29:26.064 align:middle line:90%
And I've had to change hotels.

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:28.133 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when they
ask me what's wrong,

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:29.501 align:middle line:90%
I just say, Oh, nothing.

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:30.869 align:middle line:90%
I just need to move.

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:32.971 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't want
to get into it, you know.

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:34.139 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And they're puzzled.

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:35.307 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: They're puzzled, but --

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:39.378 align:middle line:90%
and I have had situations

00:29:39.378 --> 00:29:43.749 align:middle line:84%
where ghosts have followed
me home from a haunted house.

00:29:43.749 --> 00:29:46.918 align:middle line:84%
And I've had all the classic
symptoms of a haunted house.

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:49.888 align:middle line:84%
I've had people walking
on my rooftop.

00:29:49.888 --> 00:29:53.158 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people
calling my name.

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.893 align:middle line:90%
And in one situation,

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:58.030 align:middle line:84%
this lasted for three
days and then it stopped.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.432 align:middle line:90%
And I was glad it stopped.

00:30:00.432 --> 00:30:04.703 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I thought it was Santa
and his reindeer on the roof.

00:30:04.703 --> 00:30:05.771 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yeah.

00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Has there
ever been a situation

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:13.278 align:middle line:84%
that was really untenable
for you that you thought,

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:15.347 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a bad situation here.

00:30:15.347 --> 00:30:16.782 align:middle line:90%
I can't get out of this one.

00:30:16.782 --> 00:30:19.951 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Fortunately, I've
never encountered anything

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:20.919 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't handle.

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Good.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.222 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: However, I do
know people who have.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:27.559 align:middle line:84%
I know one psychic who
was doing a tour of some

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.361 align:middle line:90%
of the castles in Ireland.

00:30:29.361 --> 00:30:31.463 align:middle line:90%
He encountered something three

00:30:31.463 --> 00:30:34.599 align:middle line:84%
and it affected him
in a bad way.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And after he got
home, he got sick

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.705 align:middle line:90%
and ended up dying of cancer.

00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:40.839 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Wow.

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.541 align:middle line:84%
You think because
of the negativity --

00:30:42.541 --> 00:30:43.475 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: It's possible.

00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:44.176 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- whatever
the entity was?

00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: It's possible.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.513 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the essential
psychic skills is learning how

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:49.848 align:middle line:90%
to clear your energy, as I said.

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:90%
I call it "running energy."

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.686 align:middle line:84%
Now, energy builds
up in everybody who's

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:55.887 align:middle line:90%
in a stressful situation --

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:56.955 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Of course.

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:57.789 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- and everybody's
stressed out.

00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:59.257 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And dreams too, right?

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:00.492 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Exactly.

00:31:00.492 --> 00:31:03.161 align:middle line:84%
Well, some people, they have
a bad day at the office,

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:06.198 align:middle line:84%
and they come home and
take it out on their wife

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:08.667 align:middle line:90%
and kids or dog, you know.

00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:12.571 align:middle line:84%
But if you're conscious
that energy has built up,

00:31:12.571 --> 00:31:16.908 align:middle line:84%
what you'll do is you'll stop
at the gym and work it out,

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:20.612 align:middle line:84%
take a walk in the woods, or
if you know how to run energy,

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:84%
you will ground that energy out
through your energetic system,

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.685 align:middle line:90%
through your grounding cord,

00:31:26.685 --> 00:31:29.855 align:middle line:84%
and into the earth,
and it's dispelled.

00:31:29.855 --> 00:31:33.325 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to pass
it on to somebody else

00:31:33.325 --> 00:31:37.095 align:middle line:84%
which creates its own ripple
effect of negative energy.

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:40.832 align:middle line:84%
So I think that essential
psychic skills are good

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:42.567 align:middle line:90%
for all people to learn.

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:44.636 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Victor, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:45.971 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:48.673 align:middle line:84%
Beyond Belief, you know, he's
a psychic and he takes on,

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I think, some of the burdens
of the planet right on him,

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.245 align:middle line:90%
but he's been able to do that.

00:31:53.245 --> 00:31:55.413 align:middle line:90%
