>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.180 align:middle line:10%
Erin Lyons with us, a
multidimensional channeler

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:10%
and healer who
infuses modalities

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:10%
such as light language,
past life integration,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:10%
Akashic healing to
spark transformation.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, through her courses,
programs, and retreats,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
she helps people
access higher timelines

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:90%
rooted in love and abundance.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a bio, Erin.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ERIN LYONS: I am amazing.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:90%
So happy to be here with you.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Oh, wow.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been a
seeker my entire life,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
pretty much I grew up with
my father being Muslim

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and my mother being
Christian Baptist.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:10%
So from a young age, I just had
these questions about existence.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:10%
And of course, no adult
can answer these questions.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.863 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being maybe five
years old, and my dad asked me,

00:01:09.863 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to be
Christian or Muslim?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
because my parents
were separated.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I go, I just want
to be a good person.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:10%
And so it's always
been within me

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:10%
to want to understand how I
got here and consciousness

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:10%
and, fast forward,
just ended up stumbling

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:10%
into so many different
philosophies, ideologies,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:10%
and religions that helped me
formulate my own understanding

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.970 align:middle line:10%
of what God or Source is.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you end up
choosing between the two?

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: I absolutely did not.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I did not choose
between the two,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
but I began doing
a ton of research.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So I can even remember
getting home from high school

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and just doing so much research
on different religions.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And I ultimately arrived
at my own conclusion

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.820 align:middle line:84%
that all of these
schools of thought

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
were just interpreting
God in their own way.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And that helped me just reach
a universal place of acceptance

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:84%
that God is everything
and within everyone.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what age was your
spiritual awakening, Erin?

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: It was
always building up,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
but I like to say it really
kicked off at age 19.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, I had
gone off to college.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, this is when
it really ramped up,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and I stumbled into a
psychedelic experience.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And I always say stumbled
into it because at the time--

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not drugs?

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I had a psychedelic
experience with LSD, and--

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I never did, but some people
have, lots of them have.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, I get
in this experience,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:90%
and I have a complete ego death.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I am reabsorbed back into
pure Source consciousness.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you trip out?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: I did not.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I did not have what people
would term a bad trip.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:90%
However, as my ego--

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I like to explain it as
it started to unravel,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
meaning the personality,
the character that

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:84%
is Erin at that time, everything
she had known and had been,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
she began to dissolve into
pure I am, into nothing.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And as I was reabsorbed
into Source consciousness,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I could see my life
leading up to this point.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, I'm having
a conversation with Source.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
We're working out all of
my trauma at this point.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
We're working
out-- we're working

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
through all of my
baggage and ultimately

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
getting to a point
of just experiencing

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:84%
eternal, pure,
unconditional love

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and ecstasy beyond
explanation and seeing

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the life that I was here to
live as a spiritual teacher

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:90%
and healer.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long were
you under that situation?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: It was quite long.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.278 align:middle line:84%
It was extensive,
probably 12 hours.

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kids, don't
do this at home.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Probably 12 hours.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And I do not recommend,
meaning I don't--

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long trip.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just something that ended
up being a part of my path.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One time?

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I did end up having
a few, maybe one or two

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:90%
other experiences.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, I
didn't really need--

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't really need them.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, I'm
very, very sensitive,

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of interdimensional
travel would take place,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and it would actually
be hard for me

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:90%
to come back into my body.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So even to this
day, I don't really

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:84%
have a need to work with plant
medicine or psychedelics.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I actually want
to stay in my body

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.575 align:middle line:84%
and be grounded so I can do
the work that I'm here to do.

00:04:41.575 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is a
holographic matrix?

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Oh.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
A holographic matrix
is-- well, first,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:84%
let's start with
what the matrix is.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.460 align:middle line:90%
It's like the movie, right?

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes, like the movie.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
However, we want to see this as
intersecting frequency signals.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of us
are electromagnetic beings.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly generating
frequencies, vibrations

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
from our body that
go out into the field

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and intersect with
the frequencies

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
that other people
are generating.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And then those
intersections begin

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:90%
to create a collective grid.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of the beings
who are plugged

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.958 align:middle line:84%
into that collective
grid, because it's

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
based on their frequency
and their consciousness,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.370 align:middle line:84%
they're having
resonant experiences.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So we could say,
there are a group

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of people who are experiencing
the third dimensional matrix,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and then there are a group of
beings who are experiencing,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
let's say, a fifth
dimensional matrix.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
collective vortices of energy

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:90%
that beings cocreate.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And then that essentially
creates a joint experience.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were going
through these situations,

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
did you feel at any point
that you could be harmed?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.185 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: You know, because
the unconditional love that I

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:90%
experienced was--

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:84%
it shed a light on
any false belief

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I ever had about myself or about
anything else within existence.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:90%
It overpowered fear.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So there are two dominant states
of being within existence,

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
being love and
fear, and then you

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:90%
have the spectrum in between.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:84%
But because this ultimate
supreme love just

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.760 align:middle line:84%
washed over me, I felt
infinitely protected.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And I also understood that
the role or the nature of what

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:84%
some people would
call evil or bad,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and I understood that that would
just be a frequency that I would

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
have to attune myself to to
be subject to that reality.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So love actually gives you
supreme protection and power

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:90%
because you're no longer afraid.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did a live stream
with your social media audience,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
thanks to technology, where you
explained what the matrix was.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
In a nutshell,
let's take a look.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: OK.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.950 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
start out with explaining

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:90%
what the matrix is.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:90%
What is a matrix?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:90%
What is the matrix?

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Why do we call it a matrix?

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
see the matrix simply

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
as different energetic
frequencies that

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:84%
are intersecting,
meaning the frequencies

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:84%
that you're generating
from your being,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.460 align:middle line:84%
they are intersecting and
interacting with the frequency

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:84%
grid lines that somebody else
is generating from their being

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:84%
because we are all
electromagnetic beings.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly generating
these frequencies,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting these frequencies,
creating our own grid.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And I just posted a reel on this
the other day or two days ago.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So when a mass part
of that consciousness

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
is vibrating on a similar
wavelength or frequency,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
they are fueling that
particular grid experience.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So if we take a step back and we
look at the entire multiverse,

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:84%
what the Galactic
Federation is showing

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:84%
me right now is there
are infinite matrix grids

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that a being can
be plugged into.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're going to
be talking about today is,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:84%
as the sovereign creator
of your reality starting

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to ask yourself, which
grid am I plugged into?

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Which matrix grid
template am I fueling?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Which matrix grid
template am I cocreating

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
with other beings who are on
that same frequency wavelength?

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty deep, girl.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: [LAUGHS]

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's very good, though.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Thank you.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
parallel realities?

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And what do they
have to do with this?

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I like to see parallel
realities as infinite frames

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
or slots within
existence that are always

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:84%
being created because Source is
experiencing itself through each

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:90%
and every one of us.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we have a new
desire, that essentially

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
creates or activates
a new timeline

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
in the-- a new reality,
parallel reality

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.350 align:middle line:84%
or timeline in
the field, quantum

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:90%
field, that can be experienced.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And so because they're
infinite in nature,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:84%
they're also all happening
and available simultaneously.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:84%
A great example of this
is when you're listening

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:90%
to the radio station and--

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My show.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Exactly.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And let's say someone decides
to change from your show

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:90%
and listen to something else.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
your station is not still

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.580 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting your show
and that beings are not

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:90%
still tuned into that.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So really, we want to see
reality as an infinite radio

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
station broadcasting
different signals, thus

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:84%
creating different realities but
all happening at the same time.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can someone
shift their timelines

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:84%
to experience
different realities?

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: 100%.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of becoming aware

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.370 align:middle line:90%
of your personal frequency.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So how you would shift
into an alternate reality

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:84%
or a parallel
version of yourself

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.740 align:middle line:84%
that's experiencing something
completely different

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:84%
is you would have to match
the vibrational signal

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:90%
of that particular frequency.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And you would do that
through becoming this person,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:84%
so looking at your
beliefs, looking

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:84%
at even your patterns,
your behaviors,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and what you subconsciously
expect from reality.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like
reprogramming yourself?

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: That's
exactly what it is,

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:84%
reprogramming your state of
being, which will ultimately

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
shift you into that
alternate version of yourself

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and the reality
that you experience.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what if
you're doing this alone?

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
How do you coexist
with other humans?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: It's really
interesting how this works.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to use the example
of family members.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Your family could be
experiencing a reality where--

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
let's say they don't have
access to any spiritual topics,

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.363 align:middle line:84%
or they're vibrating
in, let's say,

00:11:34.363 --> 00:11:35.780 align:middle line:84%
a third dimensional
consciousness.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.625 align:middle line:84%
And here you are, vibrating in a
fifth dimensional consciousness.

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way up here.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Right.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we're able
to still cocreate reality?

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's because these
realities actually

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:84%
overlap on top of
each other, and there

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
are collective
agreements and themes

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that we have in place
while simultaneously

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
being able to create our own
experience within the Earth

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.385 align:middle line:90%
game.

00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We hear a lot
about the quantum field.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I see the quantum
field in two ways, one of which

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
is the infinite set of parallel
realities that we talked about.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But also, I see it as the
quantum electron network.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum field
comprises of subatomic matter.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And on a subatomic
matter level, there

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:84%
are quantum particles that
are scanning and reading

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.130 align:middle line:84%
vibrational signals and
thus taking those signals

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and communicating throughout
the entire quantum network

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to shift and reorganize energy,
reorganize matter to then

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:90%
present a different reality.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And technically,
when this is going on,

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:90%
what's happening?

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: What's
happening is that we

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.515 align:middle line:84%
are electromagnetic beings
with a frequency signal.

00:13:03.515 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
We want to begin
seeing ourselves

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:90%
as a walking Wi-Fi signal.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:90%
We are the technology.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we all on
the same wavelength?

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: No.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:84%
We're all vibrating
different wavelengths.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum field itself is
always scanning that vibration,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:84%
responding to it,
and showing us,

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:84%
presenting to us what we
are vibrating essentially

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
in the form of
holographic pictures.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Erin, when you get into
your mode, your channeling mode,

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:84%
your healing mode, what
are you tapping into?

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:90%
God?

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: As a universal
channeler, I connect with,

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
really, three main
groups of consciousness--

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Source energy, the angelic
realm, and also galactic beings.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
quantum entanglement?

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.832 align:middle line:84%
And what does that
have to do with this?

00:14:04.832 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: When it comes
to quantum entanglement,

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at particles,
quantum particles

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
within the subatomic
field of matter,

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:84%
so this quantum
electron network that

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.800 align:middle line:84%
can be in different
places or spaces

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
but nonetheless still
communicate, still be entangled,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:90%
still exchange information.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And so with the
entanglement is the cutting

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
through time and space that
these particles, no matter

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
the distance, can
always still be

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
connected and interact to
essentially shift reality.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
we tap into that?

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Recognizing that this
quantum field, this network,

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:84%
which is infinite
intelligence, is conscious,

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's always listening to
you and responding to you.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So our scientists
actually discovered

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that electrons respond and
behave based on the observer.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they react?

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: And they react.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And then not only do they react,
they route and communicate

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:84%
that information to other
particles within the field

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.290 align:middle line:84%
so they all can work together
to reorganize themselves,

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:84%
essentially, to present
a different reality.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So the more you
become aware of that,

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
it's about shifting what I like
to call your vibrational set

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:84%
point, the frequency that
you typically operate in

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:84%
because, really, you're
already communicating

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.790 align:middle line:90%
with the field on autopilot.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some call it
Source, I call it God.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:90%
What do you call it?

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I say Source or God
interchangeably, or Universe.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: You know, when I
first spiritually awakened,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I was really obsessed
with this idea of Source

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:84%
because the word God held
so much vibrational baggage

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:90%
and attachment.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too religious?

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Right.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:84%
There was a religious
context or a dogmatic context

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
or subconscious cues
associated with a vengeful God.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I really loved
the idea of Source.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But as I've continued
to mature spiritually,

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I find that it's
less about the word,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's more about
the feeling when

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
you are connecting to what you
believe that presence to be.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
time in relationship to this?

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Time is
extremely important

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
for our human experience
because as a human,

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:90%
we are experiencing linear time.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And it allows us to have
this gradual unfolding

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
of a story, of a
theme, of a concept,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to if
we were maybe fully

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:84%
quantum, we would be able
to bilocate, trilocate,

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and experience time
completely differently,

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:84%
such as our ET star brothers
and sisters experience time.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does time and
Source have a correlation?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Source is
experiencing time in totality.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean
by that is, let's

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:31.510 align:middle line:84%
look at time as a
measure of distance.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
The time that it would
take to get from,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:84%
let's say, point A, one city, to
point B, another city, the time

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that it takes to get
to those different--

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:84%
between those different points,
that's what we typically

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:90%
experience as humans.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But for Source, it's at point
A and point B simultaneously,

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:84%
meaning its awareness is
not localized within one

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
centric point but dispersed
across all timelines,

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, and
spaces simultaneously.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:90%
So for Source, there is no time.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything's instant?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Instantaneously
present within all that is.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can we tap into
that Source and collapse time?

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: When we access
the present moment.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And the present moment can
also be called the zero point.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And zero implies not positive
or negative, or here or there.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:90%
It just simply is.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:84%
In that nothingness
is also contained--

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
everything is contained
within that nothingness.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the present
moment is when

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:84%
our mind is not in the past,
it's not in the future.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It's right here right now.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And then that gives
us access to choose

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:84%
what we would like
to experience or what

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
reality we would like
to shift into next.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Albert Einstein
would have had a great time

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:90%
chatting with you about time.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.778 align:middle line:84%
He would have had his own
thoughts and his own views.

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I would have
loved talking to him.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think time can
be controlled, manipulated?

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Absolutely.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I believe that as you begin
shifting into higher dimensional

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness,
you not only transcend time,

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:84%
but you have the ability to
speed time up or slow it down.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So an example of
speeding time up

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:84%
would be you would
understand how

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.760 align:middle line:84%
to shift through so many
different parallel realities

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:84%
at an accelerated rate that
time begins moving faster.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So when people
say they're stuck,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:84%
what's actually
happening is, they

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing parallel
realities that look, vibrate,

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and feel the same as opposed to
shifting and accessing something

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:84%
differently, so time
would feel really slow.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How slow?

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: As slow as they want
it to be based on their own idea

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
that they are stuck
somewhere within reality.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in
extraterrestrial life, Erin?

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they think of time?

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: The
extraterrestrials that I

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:84%
work with tend to operate
outside of time and leverage

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:90%
time to their advantage.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And so how they work with me
is that they can access me

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
from either the
past or the future

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
to shift an event
that is occurring

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:84%
in either one of these places
within the time continuum.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you expand into
your quantum consciousness,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:84%
this is where it
becomes extremely

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:84%
powerful to know how
to transcend time,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:84%
because you can impact different
parallel realities that are

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.610 align:middle line:90%
playing out across creation.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we control time?

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We can?

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I believe that
we can control time

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
with our perception of where
we find ourselves in reality.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So in this moment, I can decide
that although I'm experiencing

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.660 align:middle line:84%
myself here with you, I know
there are other versions of me

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:90%
other places.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And if I open myself up to that
possibility or that knowingness,

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.623 align:middle line:84%
I can even interact with
other versions of myself.

00:21:37.623 --> 00:21:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There
could be many yous.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Many parallel versions
of me, I can interact with them.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And they can give
me information that

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:84%
can help me shift the timeline,
the version of reality

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:90%
that I'm experiencing.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We hear the phrase
abundance quite a bit.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me, abundance
means accumulation.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean to you?

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I see abundance as not
being a particular condition

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that is attached to
having something or not

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:90%
having something.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So most people would
correlate abundance to money.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or possessions.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:10%
>>LYONS: Or possessions
or something specific

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.130 align:middle line:10%
that helps them generate
the feeling of having.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:10%
I more so see abundance
as the infinite access

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:10%
to different versions
of self and reality

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:10%
that are always available.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So I could be in
a state right now

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.380 align:middle line:84%
where, let's say, I don't
have the condition of money,

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:84%
but my true abundance is
that I can shift my frequency

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
to access a version
of myself that

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:90%
would experience more money.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is the true
source of my abundance,

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.935 align:middle line:84%
that I can always go
somewhere else in the field.

00:22:46.935 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Erin,
give us an example

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle line:84%
of how you would
tap into abundance.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Tapping
into abundance is

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.720 align:middle line:90%
all about your state of being.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But you see, your
state of being is

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:84%
dependent upon your
core belief system.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Most people operate on what I
call the lack operating system.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
They believe in the lack,
the absence, the missingness

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:84%
of something, as
opposed to the presence,

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.650 align:middle line:90%
the abundance of everything.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And so relating this to the
concept of parallel realities

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
in this quantum
field, if everything

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.500 align:middle line:84%
is available within
existence and you just

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.930 align:middle line:84%
have to shift your
frequency, there

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:84%
can never be a
such thing as lack.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:84%
There can be a such
thing as you experiencing

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
a version of reality where
something is lacking,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:84%
but not because it's eternally
lacking, just because that's

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
the frequency that
you're vibrating in,

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:90%
and that's what you see.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be in the
state of being of abundance,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and you can do this
by simply identifying

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:59.230 align:middle line:84%
things around you that help
you access that state of being.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it an
alternative reality?

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's a version of us that
is experiencing lack that we

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:90%
can agree to experience.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
There is a version of us that's
experiencing abundance that we

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:90%
can agree to experience.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:90%
They both exist simultaneously.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, abundance is one
of your topics of expertise.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:90%
You're very good at it.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I could tell just
by talking to you.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And you teach your clients
how to not live in scarcity.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at some of
the things you teach them.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: OK.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:10%
Abundance is the
only real truth.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:10%
The abundance that we're talking
about, quantum abundance,

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:45.600 align:middle line:10%
is the infinity of all of
these frames within existence

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:10%
that you can activate
and experience.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:10%
That's true abundance.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:57.280 align:middle line:10%
Abundance is not necessarily
the condition of you

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:10%
having to have
something right now.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:10%
This is really
important because we

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:10%
don't allow ourselves
to experience

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:10%
the emotional
qualities of abundance

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:10%
or the state of being of
abundance, which is just

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:10%
the presence of the
thing that we want,

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:10%
because we're perceiving
that we don't have it.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.440 align:middle line:10%
But when we activate, shift
into our quantum consciousness,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:10%
we know, oh, that does exist.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.060 align:middle line:10%
It has to exist.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:10%
I can't even think of
that as a possibility.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:10%
It can't even be born
inside of me as a desire

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:10%
if it doesn't exist,
if it didn't exist.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:10%
So it does exist.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
abundance really is,

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.500 align:middle line:10%
that whatever solution or
outcome that you need right now,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:10%
it does exist.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
podcasting that?

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes, I was.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
clients do you normally have?

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.505 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I work with star
seeds, many star seeds who

00:25:55.505 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:84%
are spiritually
awakened individuals

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
who are desiring to create
a new reality of abundance

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and all different
types of forms.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.110 align:middle line:84%
It could with their
business or career,

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:90%
even with their spiritual gifts.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And so essentially, I help them
become the version of themselves

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.857 align:middle line:84%
that can hold the reality
that they're asking for.

00:26:16.857 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes them come
to you in the first place, Erin?

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:90%
What are they lacking?

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: They come to me
because there's an attachment,

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.990 align:middle line:84%
there's an attachment to an
identity that they believe they

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:90%
cannot shift.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And so my work is all
about helping people

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:90%
to hack their identity.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
First, realize that
their identity is just

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:84%
a set of beliefs that
they keep subscribing to.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even to
find that identity.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yeah.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Find that identity.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Recognize that it's
not their true--

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:84%
what I say like to say is Source
self, which is that nothingness.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:90%
Really, we are all just nothing.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:58.870 align:middle line:90%
We're just consciousness.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
place of pure "I am,"

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:84%
we choose the identity
that we desire,

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:84%
which would impact how
we experience reality.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is light language?

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.448 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: I see
light language as--

00:27:14.448 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm learning
new phrases with you.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: [GIGGLES] I see light
language as sacred geometry,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually
something that was

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:90%
taught to me by angelic beings.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to look
at, let's say, a piano,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:33.090 align:middle line:84%
each of those keys on
the piano would not only

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.980 align:middle line:84%
have a particular sound, it
would also have a symbol.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And the sounds and
symbols would also

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:84%
correlate with a certain color
within the color spectrum.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And so with light
language, it actually

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is channeling sacred
geometry because as you're

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:84%
channeling the sound
vibrational tones,

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:90%
they are creating structures.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:84%
They're creating
what I like to call

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometric geometrical
light prisms that then would

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:84%
interact with someone's
electromagnetic field

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.860 align:middle line:84%
or correlate to different
chakras within the body system

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and create
multidimensional healing.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just did a complete
radio show on sacred geometry,

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and I learned more about that
than I ever thought I would.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Initially, I thought,
what does this

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:middle line:90%
have to do with mathematics?

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.486 align:middle line:90%
Nothing, totally different.

00:28:28.486 --> 00:28:29.286 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Mm-hmm.

00:28:29.286 --> 00:28:30.086 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:28:30.086 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you learn
how to tap into that,

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:90%
you can do amazing things.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Well, yes,
because sacred geometry

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:84%
is the original
blueprint for creation.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:51.661 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially when Source
decided to experience itself

00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:55.870 align:middle line:84%
what we would call the Big
Bang, that coming into being,

00:28:55.870 --> 00:29:00.230 align:middle line:84%
into creation, into form,
created sound waves.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And as those sound
waves rippled out,

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
they intersected with each
other and created patterns

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.990 align:middle line:84%
or geometrical prisms
that then created matter.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So sound is the beginning
of all structure.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've talked
about light language.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.130 align:middle line:90%
We talked about sacred geometry.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
You've talked about it on your
social media all over the place.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's take another look at you.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: --be similar to--

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
they're sort of showing me
all of the keys on a keyboard

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:84%
or the do, re, mi, fa--
whatever that whole thing is.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:84%
There are cosmic
symbols that would then

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:84%
be the energetic representation
of that sound frequency.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's all interconnected.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Light language is literally
speaking in sacred geometry.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And so because you're using
these sound codes and dialects

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:84%
that create these very
intricate patterns,

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:08.500 align:middle line:84%
those patterns and structures
hold raw cosmic information

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and key codes that
when they interact

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
with your electromagnetic
field, they trigger a quantum

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:90%
rearrangement.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.880 align:middle line:84%
This is all deeply
and very scientific.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.890 align:middle line:90%
How do you learn this stuff?

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: It downloads to me at--

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who downloads it?

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.982 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Source,
angels, galactic beings.

00:30:30.982 --> 00:30:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I want that contact.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: [LAUGHS]
And also building

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:84%
on top of what other amazing
people are contributing

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to the spirituality
space as well.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Erin, somebody at
home watching you right now

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.630 align:middle line:84%
on "Beyond Belief,"
and they're saying,

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.390 align:middle line:90%
how does she tap into this?

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:90%
I want to be able to do this.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:90%
What do you recommend?

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:90%
What do we tell them?

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: It's
actually quite simple

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.390 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to channeling.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is already a channel.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It's more so a matter of,
what are you channeling?

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Is your tuner set to
high-vibrational messages,

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.800 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, concepts, beings,
or low-vibrational concepts,

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.770 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, beliefs,
thoughts, et cetera?

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:19.350 align:middle line:84%
The more you raise your core
vibration, which is simply

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
what is my emotional
state of being mostly,

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that will give you
access to being

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:84%
able to receive, being
a receptive mode,

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:34.600 align:middle line:84%
to receive and communicate with
what we would call God, Source,

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
higher intelligence,
or beings who operate

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.190 align:middle line:90%
in an extremely high frequency.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to
hear and experience

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.440 align:middle line:84%
what light language is with
you doing a demonstration.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: OK.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could you do that?

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So let me just tune in here
and see what the intention

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.290 align:middle line:90%
is for this light language.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:54.242 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:54.242 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be for you
but also for everyone watching.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.123 align:middle line:84%
And it's a heart chakra
attunement coming from Source.

00:32:04.123 --> 00:32:09.140 align:middle line:90%


00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.512 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:32:12.512 --> 00:32:36.130 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you aware of
what you were just doing?

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes, I was aware.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But light language
doesn't translate

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:48.200 align:middle line:84%
as a word-for-word
explanation, if we will,

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's meant
to bypass the ego.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It's meant to speak directly
to the soul, the true essence

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:02.830 align:middle line:84%
of our being to help us realign
or enter a harmonic rhythm

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.920 align:middle line:90%
with a particular intention.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've never heard
that language before.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Really?

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.690 align:middle line:90%
How did how did you feel?

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was intriguing.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: [LAUGHS]
So if you noticed,

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I was also moving my hands.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quite a bit.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: My hands were creating
or following the sacred geometry

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:90%
of what those sound codes were.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So you see, it's
all interconnected.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Where does that
language come from?

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.915 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Light language
can come from your own soul

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:45.330 align:middle line:84%
because you are a Source
being, an energetic being.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.388 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What were you saying?

00:33:48.388 --> 00:33:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: There's not a
word-for-word translation,

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:51.712 align:middle line:90%
but I can give you an idea.

00:33:51.712 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Paraphrase it.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Sure.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.360 align:middle line:84%
From what I saw, we were
going into the heart chakra.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And we were opening
up a new frequency

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that can allow beings to relate
to reality from a place of fun,

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:90%
joy, peace, and harmony.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So using sacred geometry
and those sound codes

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:22.500 align:middle line:84%
to repattern and organize,
let's say, disharmonious energy

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.780 align:middle line:90%
being stored in that center.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can tell, Erin, that
love is important in your life.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:84%
What is your true
definition of love?

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:37.179 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Love, to me,
is total acceptance

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:84%
of all that is because
within this experience,

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.690 align:middle line:84%
within creation, there's
high-vibrational,

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.520 align:middle line:84%
there's low-vibrational, but it
all serves an intention for us

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.360 align:middle line:90%
to expand as consciousness.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you are no longer in
judgment of anything or anyone

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:58.280 align:middle line:84%
or anything that's
unfolding, that

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:84%
is what true
unconditional love is.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is where Source resides
in the highest frequency of love

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.140 align:middle line:84%
for all things
that are happening.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How powerful is
love if it's applied right?

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Love is the
most powerful frequency

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.240 align:middle line:84%
because our
related-to-quantum reality--

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.970 align:middle line:84%
if I'm embodying a
frequency of love

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's my dominant
state of being,

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be in
continual attraction

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:84%
with other things that
will feel like love.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.950 align:middle line:84%
It really is the best way
to manifest your reality.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't seem to
love enough on this planet.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Look at what's been
going on worldwide

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.820 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of mankind.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Why are we lacking that?

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Because we
have been conditioned

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.060 align:middle line:90%
to believe in separation.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.840 align:middle line:84%
You see, when I believe
that my beliefs are better

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.750 align:middle line:84%
than your beliefs or they
are right or correct,

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and I have a need to control
you or overpower you or dominate

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:03.450 align:middle line:84%
you, or when we believe we have
to hurt people to gain something

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that we believe we
don't already have,

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.170 align:middle line:84%
we're believing
that we're separate,

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're also believing
that we lack things.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And those two states
of being always

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
manifest a lack of love that
can be accessed and experienced.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we make that
quantum leap, Erin, and love?

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Begin developing an
unconditional relationship

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.280 align:middle line:90%
with yourself.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.390 align:middle line:84%
You see, if I can't
unconditionally accept myself,

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I can't unconditionally
accept others.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:84%
If I learn how to
unconditionally accept myself

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.390 align:middle line:84%
in all of my perceived flaws
and these types of things,

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I will be in a
state of being where

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I have space to accept
and love other people.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have to summon them?

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Or do they just show
up in your life?

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: At this point,
they really just show up.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.105 align:middle line:84%
However, at times,
I will sort of

00:36:57.105 --> 00:37:00.270 align:middle line:84%
invoke or initiate or
really set the intention

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.830 align:middle line:90%
for the communication to occur.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it take you a
long time to get into that mode?

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: No, not really.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you do
a demonstration for us?

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:09.338 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's another one.

00:37:09.338 --> 00:37:10.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Channeling.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Well, right
now, Source energy

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.600 align:middle line:84%
is wanting to come through
as the dominant frequency

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.610 align:middle line:90%
to work with.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you have questions
for us, George?

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who am
I talking to now?

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: All that is.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.960 align:middle line:90%


00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
occupied Erin Lyon's body?

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: We are blended and
merged with her consciousness.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what have
you learned doing this?

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Through blending and
merging with her consciousness,

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:84%
we are able to work
in her vocabulary,

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.150 align:middle line:84%
the concepts contained
within her consciousness,

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and interact with
you, with humanity.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:90%


00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why did you select her?

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.190 align:middle line:90%


00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: She had the
vibration and the enthusiasm

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:16.000 align:middle line:84%
regarding her love for creation,
her love for existence,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:84%
her love for all that
is, and a deep desire

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:25.390 align:middle line:84%
to spread that love
amongst other beings.

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But she is not more
special than any of you.

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you part of Source?

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: We are all that is.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.190 align:middle line:84%
You see, there's nothing that
exists outside of all that is.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:45.070 align:middle line:84%
All there is, was, and ever
shall be is all there is.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
make all things?

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: All things are
created from our consciousness,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.690 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness that
you are also connected to.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
the universe start?

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: The universe began
with us coming into "I am,"

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.190 align:middle line:90%
the recognition that we existed.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Before that, we were just
floating around as nothingness,

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:18.630 align:middle line:90%
bored.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we came into "I am,"
the next question was, well,

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.220 align:middle line:90%
what am I?

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.760 align:middle line:84%
What do I have the
potential to become?

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:37.630 align:middle line:84%
What do I have the
possibility of experiencing?

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before there was
a universe, what was there?

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Nothing.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is nothing?

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Everything.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.340 align:middle line:90%
True potential.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did
you as Source get here?

00:39:54.445 --> 00:39:57.060 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.803 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: As energy becoming
conscious of itself.

00:39:59.803 --> 00:40:02.850 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:07.830 align:middle line:84%
But even before the awareness
of self, we always existed.

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of the human spirit?

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: One of the most
fabulous designs and creations

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that have manifested
from consciousness.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It does have its
good side and bad side.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: We do not see
in terms of good and bad.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.740 align:middle line:84%
We would say, you make
high-vibrational choices,

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and you make
low-vibrational choices.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, we do not hold
judgment towards those choices,

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.160 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you will always
return back to the infinite "I

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:39.960 align:middle line:90%
am."

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.660 align:middle line:84%
You see, these
experiences are temporary.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Surely, though,
you see evil on this planet.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: We
recognize what humans

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:54.470 align:middle line:84%
call evil as being a frequency
that can be experienced.

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
believe in the devil?

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: We are all
that is, so all things

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:04.230 align:middle line:90%
are existent within us.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:84%
We would not
experience ourselves

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.795 align:middle line:90%
as being separate from anything.

00:41:08.795 --> 00:41:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying
the devil is within you?

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: A manifestation of
what some within consciousness

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:84%
are choosing to believe,
but nonetheless a part of us

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.400 align:middle line:90%
because we are everything.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:27.080 align:middle line:84%
But it is an idea, a
concept that beings

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.430 align:middle line:90%
can nurture and allow to exist.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever get
vindictive to a human?

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: We have no reason to.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.820 align:middle line:84%
We operate in unconditional
love because we recognize

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.540 align:middle line:84%
the value in all
experiences in every part

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.110 align:middle line:90%
of your being, all aspects--

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we have free will?

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: --of who you are.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we have free will?

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Free will is the
basis of the universe,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.430 align:middle line:84%
for if we were to control
everything that you do,

00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:02.040 align:middle line:84%
it would defeat the
purpose of being

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.040 align:middle line:84%
able to believe that
you are separate from us

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and create realities
that you desire.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't you
step in and stop wars?

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Wars are
a manifestation

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of a collective
consciousness vibrating

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:21.590 align:middle line:90%
in a certain frequency.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:24.640 align:middle line:90%
It is a part of your free will.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:31.260 align:middle line:84%
For us to take away
your free will,

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.860 align:middle line:84%
it would go against the
very laws of creation

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.220 align:middle line:90%
that we have set forth.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you obviously
don't condone it?

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: We see
things differently.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:52.520 align:middle line:84%
We see the opportunity that all
experiences possess and hold

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.410 align:middle line:90%
as a gift to the soul.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not while you're
in the human body will

00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:00.710 align:middle line:84%
you see it from our
broader vantage point.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:03.680 align:middle line:84%
But surely, all
souls will reconcile

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.420 align:middle line:84%
with their decisions
and their experiences,

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and you see everything
you experienced

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and everything that is
learned by your soul

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:15.510 align:middle line:84%
also ripples into the
entirety of the creation,

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.000 align:middle line:90%
and we all expand.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.873 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
future of mankind?

00:43:18.873 --> 00:43:21.720 align:middle line:90%


00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.390 align:middle line:10%
>>LYONS: Well, what
we will tell you today

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:27.990 align:middle line:10%
is that you should
all be prepared

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:10%
for your galactic brothers
and sisters who are coming.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah?

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Already here
but coming to assist you

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:40.620 align:middle line:84%
with learning how to reharmonize
with the rhythms and the cycles

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:48.480 align:middle line:84%
of your planet and how different
sea levels will be shifting

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:84%
on your planet that will change
the way that you have to live.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.090 align:middle line:84%
That is all that we
will say at this time.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you bring
Erin back for us now?

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: She's been
here the whole time.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Erin?

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes?

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you realize
the things you said?

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty much
conscious for most of that.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.360 align:middle line:90%
It may start leaving me.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So the way that I channel,
it doesn't have to be,

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:18.010 align:middle line:84%
let's say, a full
transchannel, so to speak.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.860 align:middle line:90%
It really is a blending.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The best way I can describe
it is a blending and a merging

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:27.690 align:middle line:84%
wherein I'm accessing a flow
state where they can just

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:30.640 align:middle line:84%
take over, but I
can also be present.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.810 align:middle line:84%
There are different degrees
of channeling and times

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.150 align:middle line:84%
where I'm less
present, so we'll have

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:38.530 align:middle line:84%
to see where my channeling
journey takes me.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LYONS: People can reach me and
find me at erinlyonsofficial.com

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:48.330 align:middle line:10%
or "Erin Lyons TV" on YouTube.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: E-R-I-N?

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LYONS: Yes.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:52.865 align:middle line:90%
E-R-I-N L-Y-O-N-S.

00:44:52.865 --> 00:44:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Erin, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LYONS: Thank you so much
for having me, George.

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:59.090 align:middle line:84%
I had a phenomenal
time with you.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:04.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tapping into the
Source, "the God," is fantastic.

00:45:04.505 --> 00:45:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And there are all
kinds of things

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.360 align:middle line:90%
I've learned in this program.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.490 align:middle line:90%
I hope you have too.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
