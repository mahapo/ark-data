00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:84%
We've got a real special guest
for you today, Regina Meredith.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:10%
Regina is an Emmy award-winning
producer, and of course,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:10%
hosts her own program,
Open Minds on Gaia,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:10%
that is probably one of the
most astounding shows I've ever

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.551 align:middle line:10%
seen.

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:39.508 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: That's
a very kind statement

00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:10%
coming from you, George.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.065 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going to talk
about a different aspect

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:90%
of you.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Something that a lot
of people don't know--

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that you're interested in
science and the universe

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.984 align:middle line:84%
But how did you get started in
all this in the first place?

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, I think everyone
has the beginning of what

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
we call their woo-woo
journey, although I

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
don't like the term woo-woo
or new-age anymore at all.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But the journey of looking
beyond the tangible, physical

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Which is essentially the
meaning of the word occult.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think of it in a dark
spectrum, when it simply means

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:90%
the truth that's hidden, right?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And so, I've been
interested in hidden truths

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
for probably about
30 or 40 years

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
now, which started with
my first meditation.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I did a little TM
with a girlfriend.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Not officially, because
I wasn't given my mantra.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I just chose a word and
she put me in a room

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
with a 20-minute alarm on it and
said, OK, just say your word.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So, I said my word and about
10 minutes into the meditation,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing, all of a
sudden, I was somewhere else

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:84%
watching an Indian
woman in a sari jumping

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:90%
to her death over a cliff.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And she had a red
sari on, it was

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
flapping in the wind over
these very dry lands,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.716 align:middle line:84%
plunging to her
death in slow motion.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, that was
the first time I

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.870 align:middle line:84%
had a full-on other kind
of experience slash vision

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:90%
while I was awake.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.581 align:middle line:84%
And so, that began
the curiosity--

00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:06.622 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the journey.

00:02:06.622 --> 00:02:08.038 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And
the journey, yeah.

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to talk with
you about alternative universes.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.275 align:middle line:90%
Tell me your thoughts on that.

00:02:13.275 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well,
the way I might

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
term it is more parallel
dimensions, dimensions

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And my particular interest
has been, for many years,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
because of some later
guidance that I had--

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I've had for the last
30 years an association

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.824 align:middle line:84%
with this particular
woman who was

00:02:30.824 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:84%
a channel, although at
the time, I didn't know

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:90%
what channeling was.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had access to these
beings that had really,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.190 align:middle line:84%
to this day, probably the most
pristine body of knowledge

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:90%
I've ever been exposed to.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Very clean, clear, austere.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Nothing personal.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Just get to the facts,
asking about science,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:84%
healing, the universe,
how things work.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
curious about that.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And a story emerged from that
that captivated me and really

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
has held me since then
into understanding

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that, in my opinion, it's at
the crux of what we are today

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and what we need to
break free from in order

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:90%
to reclaim our sovereignty.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And not by way of a
dark agenda, but by way

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.141 align:middle line:84%
of being asleep
for so very long.

00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:15.941 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's the area that
I love, is the interface

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
of other dimensional
beings, Earth humans, others

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that are from other places,
third dimensional space beings,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call them that.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Extraterrestrials.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And Earth and how the
whole thing came together.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And how it's still
working together.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
That's my particular
fascination.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.869 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people believe
Bigfoot might be dimensional.

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes, they do.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview recently
with a French Canadian shaman,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
wonderful man, Son
Bow, and he has

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
had communication of
a telepathic nature

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:90%
with these beings.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And they have begun telling
him stories about the origins

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:90%
of their species.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the origins
of our species,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:90%
and how this plays together.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And Bigfoot seems
to have the capacity

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:84%
to phase out of
this dimension when

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:90%
need be, and phase back in.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Which might be part of
the secret of what's

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:84%
kept them basically safe
and still in existence

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.935 align:middle line:90%
throughout all these years.

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:19.002 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And uncaught.

00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: That's what I mean.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.277 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:20.277 --> 00:04:20.739 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.889 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
really remarkable.

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:22.689 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With these
dimensional travelers,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
like Bigfoot, for example,
how do you think it works?

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.045 align:middle line:84%
How do they come in
and come out at will?

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: I don't know.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
But I am guessing it has
to do with pure projection

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:84%
If they have a, so to speak,
an intention or desire,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
they're able to literally shift
their frequency range so it

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:90%
comes into the visible range.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And they can retract or
withdraw that literally at will.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.850 align:middle line:90%
How that works, I have no idea.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if they don't
even know that they're doing it?

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:90%
What if it's accidental?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They stumbled into a portal or
something and here they are.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Well, that goes
back to my original story

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:10%
about the mysterious origins
of the human species,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:10%
where something like
that did kind of occur.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think once you're an
integrated species and you've

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
been around for a
few 100,000 years,

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
something they accidentally

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:90%
pop in and out of.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I would think it would be by
design and by consciousness,

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.660 align:middle line:84%
if they're capable
of doing that.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:84%
It is not a normal, simple
thing for any species

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to phase
in and out physically

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:90%
of another dimension.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:84%
That takes some
skill and knowledge.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
amazing possibility

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
that there are multiverses
and other dimensions that

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:90%
are out there.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.797 align:middle line:90%
It boggles the mind, doesn't it?

00:05:44.797 --> 00:05:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: It does.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think we
can conceive of anything yet

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.600 align:middle line:84%
that we can't essentially
see, touch, taste, feel.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have to go then on
a matter of either intellect

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:90%
or faith.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And when the two
come together, to me,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
that's where it
becomes interesting.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't take the world
of scientific materialism

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:90%
as the God's truth.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't take
channeled or intuitively

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:84%
revealed information, per
se, as the God's truth.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But when you start seeing
the overlay between them,

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
that's, to me, where life
starts becoming interesting

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and where a lot of
progress can start

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
being made in almost
every area of life

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
from science,
medicine, archeology,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:90%
understanding our human nature.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you constantly
asking yourself who are we?

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:90%
What are we?

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.962 align:middle line:90%
How did it start?

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, that's
what I do my talks on.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:90%
That exact subject.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned,
I came in contact

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
with this information from this
group of beings very long ago.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I started looking
at all of the other stories.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:84%
All of the research I've
done this 30 years since,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
to see if it had
some truth to it.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.640 align:middle line:84%
If this could possibly hold
water on a large pre-history

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:90%
scale.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And as far as we can go,
because it's prehistory,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:84%
which we don't have any
evidence of, no matter what

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
religion or belief system, it's
the closest thing to something

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
that feels cohesive to
me as to what we are now,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:84%
why we're here, how we got here,
and then what the charges in us

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:90%
now, where we're going.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, I think
about that a lot.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I lecture on it.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.035 align:middle line:84%
And I call it our
mysterious human origins.

00:07:28.035 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever
get these answers?

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well,
you could arguably

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:90%
say maybe the answers are here.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.475 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of whether we
choose to believe them or not.

00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:36.393 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or find them.

00:07:36.393 --> 00:07:37.434 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Or find them.

00:07:37.434 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Or take them and test them,
start looking at it through--

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:90%
this is the thing.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
There are so many people
that are intuitive, open,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:84%
actually pretty clear
channels of information,

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:84%
just as intuitives
in regular people.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:10%
I think Dolores
Cannon's work was really

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.115 align:middle line:10%
a wonderful representation--

00:07:56.115 --> 00:07:57.449 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: God bless her soul.

00:07:57.449 --> 00:07:58.657 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Yes, I loved her.

00:07:58.657 --> 00:07:59.306 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She was a giant.

00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:00.139 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: She was.

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is, as she
went through all those years,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:10%
she kept hearing these touching
points in these stories

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:10%
from people.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Like going back to
the days of Atlantis.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:90%
The early days.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
The final days, the early
days and final days of Egypt.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
These people, thousands
of regressions.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Their information
was overlapping.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Now we take that and just
throw it off as well, I wonder.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I look at it and
say, if there is

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.580 align:middle line:84%
a collective story
that's emerging,

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:90%
that's coming from us.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
We need to take this
seriously and look into it.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:84%
And maybe have people
that are capable

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
travel a little more deeply
back into that information

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.652 align:middle line:84%
and see what they
can bring forward.

00:08:37.652 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:90%
We know it can be done.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Tom Campbell.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.856 align:middle line:84%
My Big Toe and what he did with
the Monroe Institute, right?

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:10%
They went back
together-- they went out

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:10%
and they connected
together and were

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.336 align:middle line:10%
able to bring back information.

00:08:49.336 --> 00:08:51.210 align:middle line:84%
There are people that
can go back in the past

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
together and bring
back information

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:90%
that concurs with one another.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of the things
that we're constantly

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
striving for is to try
to figure out how we

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.840 align:middle line:90%
were formed in this universe.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.055 align:middle line:90%
We call it the big bang.

00:09:06.055 --> 00:09:07.420 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The beginning of everything.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.170 align:middle line:10%
The Big Bang.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:10%
The idea that the
universe was suddenly born

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:10%
and is not infinite.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:10%
Up to the middle of
the 20th century,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.200 align:middle line:10%
most scientists
thought of the universe

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:10%
as infinite and ageless.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:10%
Until Einstein's
theory of relativity

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:10%
gave us a better
understanding of gravity,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:10%
and Edwin Hubble discovered
that galaxies are moving apart

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:10%
from one another in a way that
fits previous predictions.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:10%
In 1964, by accident,
cosmic background radiation

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:10%
was discovered.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.700 align:middle line:10%
A relic of the early
universe, which

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:10%
together with other
observational evidence,

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.490 align:middle line:10%
made the Big Bang the
accepted theory in science.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:10%
Since then, improved technology
like the Hubble telescope

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.280 align:middle line:10%
has given us a pretty good
picture of the Big Bang

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:10%
and the structure of the cosmos.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:10%
Recent observations
even seem to suggest

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:10%
that the expansion of the
universe is accelerating.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No wonder you
call your show Open Minds.

00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: You have
to have an open mind.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
that's what it is.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: It is.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is an example.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So, what we've just watched
here is the scientific rendering

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:90%
of how our universe started.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I were to listen to
the beings that educated me

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
through the years, they would
say something like this.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:90%
There was no Big Bang.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
They said, that is not-- in the
large scale and even the macro

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:90%
scale--

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:90%
how creation works.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.120 align:middle line:84%
There is a template of
sorts, and with the template,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
you start magnetizing
all of the elements.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
You're using sound, you're
using light, motion,

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
the elements and gases forming
together to form universes,

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:84%
to form solar systems, and to
form a planet and the things

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.010 align:middle line:90%
upon the planet.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And that creation is not
a chaotic, random thing.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Creation is a process.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And everything
goes through-- just

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
like a baby, from the original
sperm into the adult man,

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:90%
goes through a process.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's no
different with your universe.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But the hard part,
I think, for people

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:84%
to get their mind
around, that means

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:84%
where did the
template come from?

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And that gets you to
the nature of what

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
is mind, what is creation,
what is the great creator?

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Is there such a being?

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Are there a group
of beings that--

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.460 align:middle line:84%
they're like you and me,
but have vast abilities

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
to create and spin
this vision into what

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:90%
drops into a physical reality.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they'd say happened.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So, how can you marry
these two, right?

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On my
radio show, Regina,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.042 align:middle line:84%
I cannot find a physicist
to explain the Big Bang.

00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: No one can.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.458 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm
beginning to think

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:47.379 align:middle line:84%
you are absolutely right that
maybe it never even happened.

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: As above, so below.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the hermetic axiom.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
If you decide you're going to
create a beautiful painting,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.600 align:middle line:84%
you have at your
disposal the minerals

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and such that create the
colors and the paint, right?

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
You have the medium,
the paper and such,

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
whatever canvas that
you're going to paint on.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
You have an idea in your
head, and you execute it.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:90%
And that is your creation.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.720 align:middle line:84%
What if you were able to create
at the level of mind that

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:90%
can simply create a universe?

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.045 align:middle line:90%
It's no different.

00:12:14.045 --> 00:12:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
talking about the fact

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
that we might be living in
a digital world right now.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I find that hard to believe
that somebody could blot us out

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:90%
at any moment.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.157 align:middle line:90%
But it's possible.

00:12:24.157 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: It's possible.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't really tend
to go there with that.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that life and creation
is a much more organic thing

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Now does that mean that we're
not in a type of digital mind

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:90%
matrix?

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Of course, we are.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We're programmed from
the second we're born.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Our souls have been programmed
throughout our incarnation

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:90%
paths.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So you can say that our
subconscious mind is certainly

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:90%
a program.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And then waiting to have new
input in there, so that you

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
can start changing
the program so

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that it's functioning
on your behalf and maybe

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.130 align:middle line:90%
a more cohesive way.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody's
looking for that.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
How to have a better
life, which means

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:84%
you have to really
intersect new data

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and open up the mind
and the subconscious

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
mind for new inputs so that
you can start creating.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.855 align:middle line:90%
But that's within our power.

00:13:12.855 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
There is, I don't
think, anything

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.396 align:middle line:90%
that's going to blot us out.

00:13:15.396 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe we're
simply a digital reality.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Even though, again, going
back to Tom Campbell,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:84%
he would say that our
reality we experience

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.790 align:middle line:84%
is collectively rendered,
which in editing terms,

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.515 align:middle line:90%
of course, is a digital process.

00:13:29.515 --> 00:13:30.527 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:30.527 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: But
at the same time,

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that is simply a matter
of a collectively agreed

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:84%
upon substance and
mind and experience.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:84%
If this is a human and this
is what humans look like,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.536 align:middle line:90%
we agree on that.

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that is how the
mind will perceive it.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Even though we know
that we can't even

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:90%
do the number of digits.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:90%
We are simply space.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you just look
at the atomic functioning,

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
you take, say, an
atom of fluoride--

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fluoride-- the
exact same number of electrons

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.377 align:middle line:84%
in that atom as you have
planets in our solar system.

00:14:03.377 --> 00:14:04.177 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: All
the rest is space.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So, what is it that's creating
this illusion of density

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:90%
and my perception of you?

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:84%
That, I think, is a
collectively agreed upon reality

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
or collectively
rendered reality.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
make it inorganic.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make it
digital, in my opinion.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the years of
doing Open Minds, have

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:84%
you made a decision on
divine intelligence or a God?

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.595 align:middle line:90%
Is it there?

00:14:32.595 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, as I said,
if you take that other story

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
about the origins of the
universe, it would have to be,

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't it?

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something's
got to be there.

00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Something of a
vast level of intelligence

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:84%
is able to create at capacity
levels we can't understand,

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle line:84%
just as we we're able to create
beyond the capacity of an ant.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:84%
If an ant can work in a
hive mentality and tunnel

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.270 align:middle line:90%
a little bit--

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're brilliant.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Dig a little bit
and create a cohesive community,

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
they've got their
brilliant community.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:84%
You might be able to make
a beautiful masterpiece.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:90%
That's your capability.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:90%
You do what you do.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:90%
You use your words.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
You affect people
around the world.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:90%
That's your capability.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
They just have a greater
capability, I believe.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.820 align:middle line:90%
So I do believe that.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
in the dance on Earth

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.470 align:middle line:84%
to me is that just like in our
bodies, on a cellular level,

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.840 align:middle line:84%
we have anabolic and
catabolic function.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Cells are born, cells die.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:90%
We're born, we die.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Stars.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything is born and it dies.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, you
are able to decide

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:84%
after all these years of
doing shows like Open Minds

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that there is what
I will call God.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- you can call it
God, you can call it the great

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:84%
creative force,
you can call it--

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.727 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Energy.

00:15:48.727 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Anything.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:90%
Energy.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is where
we get hung up politically.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
The political
religious movements

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.281 align:middle line:84%
of, say, intelligent design
that ticks off all the atheists.

00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's always ticking
off somebody in this--

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.635 align:middle line:90%
You can't win.

00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:05.718 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: You can't win.

00:16:05.718 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:90%
But the reality is, you look--

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.330 align:middle line:90%
OK, you look at a rose.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you honestly think that
that's a random explosion

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:90%
of some chaotic matter?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
There is such a
beautiful patterning

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and design and geometry.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
There's such incredible
grace and beauty

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:84%
in the way this world
has been created,

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that happens by a
random assemblage of molecules.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Thus, something,
someone, somewhere

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:84%
has the capability to
create on vast scales.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when I
landed in Denver yesterday

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:84%
for these programs
today, I'm going up

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:84%
the escalator at the Denver
airport, and I'm looking,

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Regina, at all these
people on the escalator.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm looking at them, they
all get off with their legs,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and their arms are
holding their suitcases,

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and their eyes are
looking around.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And I always ask myself
these strange questions.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:90%
Who could conceive of this?

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
To create a creature that
needs legs to walk around, that

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
needs arms to hold things and
create, that needs eyes to see,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
that needs a nose to smell, that
needs a mouth to talk and eat.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant!

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: It is.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.399 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
happen by random?

00:17:26.399 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Not only does
it not happen randomly,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion-- these
are my opinions--

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
but some of the people I've
interviewed along the way--

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think this also was
in George Adamski's work--

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:84%
there is a thought that this
is the most perfected kind

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:84%
of physical species
to work through.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Even if we were
slightly less dense,

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
we have the capacities to do a
lot in this particular vehicle.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.145 align:middle line:84%
More than any other one we
see on Earth, for example.

00:17:56.145 --> 00:17:58.062 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If dolphins
only could have fingers--

00:17:58.062 --> 00:17:59.895 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: If they
only had fingers, right?

00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so they say that this
humanoid configuration

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:90%
exists throughout the universe.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.800 align:middle line:84%
That there are
thousands and thousands

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
of other planets with
humans, with human features,

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:90%
more or less.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe some of them
have one finger omitted.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Or something like that.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:84%
But still, this is the
preferred vehicle in order

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.716 align:middle line:90%
to express one's creativity.

00:18:21.716 --> 00:18:22.715 align:middle line:90%

>>ZECHARIA SITCHIN: How
could possibly the Sumerians

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:10%
know that the sun
is in the center

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:10%
and that's how the solar
system came into being,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.560 align:middle line:10%
and there was an
invader, and the invader

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.696 align:middle line:10%
has this great elliptical
orbit, et cetera.

00:18:48.696 --> 00:18:51.540 align:middle line:10%
And the answer,
again, it is written.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:10%
It is written down that
they are not called tablets,

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:10%
they are called cylinders.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:10%
Square cylinders, in this case.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:10%
And this one, in particular.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.890 align:middle line:10%
Another one like it can
be seen by any one of you

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:10%
if you go to England, to
Oxford, to the Ashmolean Museum.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:10%
And this is called the
Sumerian Kings List.

years before the deluge,

a people called
Anunnaki, in this text,

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:42.800 align:middle line:10%
called Anunnaki, came from
their planet and visited Earth

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:10%

>>NOORY: What a
great researcher.

00:19:47.864 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I had the luxury of giving
him a Lifetime Achievement

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.956 align:middle line:84%
Award at the Conscious Life
Expo several years ago,

00:19:53.956 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:90%
before he passed on.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
was curious to see

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:84%
how old he was, because he
has been going on forever

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So, while we're giving
him the award, and I went,

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia, how old
are you, anyway?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:90%
In front of this big audience.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And he stopped and says,
George, that's very rude.

never forget that.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:18.967 align:middle line:90%
But the guy was a genius.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: He was a genius,
and he had a huge contribution.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And I met him probably, maybe
even right around that time,

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:90%
at the Expo.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.036 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing I
remember about him--

00:20:28.036 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:90%
this a silly little thing--

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
is he was-- I don't know
why we were holding hands.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.440 align:middle line:90%
He liked me, I guess.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
We were holding
hands for a minute.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:84%
He had the softest
baby skin I have ever

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:90%
felt outside of a baby.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.243 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was
about 90 years old.

00:20:40.243 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: He was very old.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:90%
It was right before he died.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, yes.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:10%
And I find that the
work he did in terms

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:10%
of his interpretations, and
there are other people--

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:10%
Chris Hardy, who is doing
beautiful interpretations

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:10%
of the work, as well.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Very useful,
because it gives us,

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, a glimpse
of our modern history.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Our history, there's
enough evidence now.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.152 align:middle line:84%
Michael Cremo work
alone, many others.

00:21:05.152 --> 00:21:05.952 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:21:05.952 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Oh my gosh.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
We're hundreds of millions
of years old, as a species.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.264 align:middle line:84%
We've had many, many
civilizations throughout time--

00:21:13.264 --> 00:21:14.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And many catastrophes.

00:21:14.555 --> 00:21:15.971 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And
many catastrophes.

00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is at least
capturing the latest one.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.122 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:19.122 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I think he did
brilliant work there.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:21.567 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:21.567 --> 00:21:22.367 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:21:22.367 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Michael Heiser
doesn't accept his theories.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:10%
He was at odds with Sitchin.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But the more times I interviewed
Sitchin, the more I would say,

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:90%
how could the guy be wrong?

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.390 align:middle line:84%
He's looking at these clay
tablets and these cuneiforms.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:39.589 align:middle line:90%
How could he be wrong?

00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, I don't
think it's about being wrong.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a place
for both of these stories.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
piece of that story

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:84%
from that part of
the world, he may be

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.450 align:middle line:90%
fairly accurately interpreting.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.240 align:middle line:10%
But it's only a pixel
of our history, and only

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.650 align:middle line:10%
one place on the planet that was
under development at that time.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just that that one
has the surviving texts.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: DNA manipulation.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Mm hmm.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda Moulton
Howe, of course,

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.323 align:middle line:84%
interviewed a
whistleblower about that.

>>LINDA MOULTON
HOWE: Sherman said

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:10%
that he had been told that the
EBENs experimented genetically

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:10%
in Bhutan, Tibet, and
Nepal, and then transplanted

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:10%
some of those altered
human ET hybrids to what we

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:10%
call the Yucatan and Guatemala
region of Central America.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:10%
Sherman said the EBENs used
DNA harvested and manipulated

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:10%
from Bhutan for another EBEN
genetic experiment far away

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:10%
to the other side of the
world from the Himalayas.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:10%
Then, in 850 AD, Sherman
said the EBENs beamed up

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:10%
most of the Mayan
ET human hybrids

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:10%
and transported them to another
planet for unknown reasons.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.689 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a wild story.

00:22:59.689 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, it is
a wild story on one hand.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But I can maybe toss a
couple things into this.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I would argue there's not a
person listening, including

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
you and I sitting here;
that some aspect of us

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.460 align:middle line:84%
has not been genetically
modified sometime

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:90%
in our distant, distant past.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:84%
That was what occurred in
the early part of time.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
There were genetic
manipulations.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And not necessarily for
dark purposes at all.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.135 align:middle line:90%
But simply out of need.

00:23:28.135 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I talk about when

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I do that origin story,
such as at Starworks USA,

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:84%
is I talk about that
part of the story,

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:84%
specifically, that we need to
stop taking umbrage to the fact

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
that we have been part of
an enhancement process,

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:90%
We are what we are.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:90%
We're still flesh and blood.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the differences
in different people, even.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
We look at and say, oh, jeez,
that looked like an ET there.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And now as far as the Mayans--

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and so I would argue that
certainly in Atlantis,

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
engineering going on.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But I would further
argue, far prior to that,

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:84%
that we are ourselves
a hybrid species,

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and there was a little bit
of electrical engineering

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:84%
that went on to make these
two species fit together.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.840 align:middle line:84%
As far as the Mayans go, the
beings that I have talked

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:84%
about a couple of
times already, part

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
of what they told
me ages ago was I

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:84%
was asking about the
Mayans, why does no one

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
understand what
happened to the Mayans?

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And they said very
simply, well you

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.120 align:middle line:84%
know there's always
been space travel,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universes,
and on your planet as well.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:90%
You've always had others there.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.861 align:middle line:84%
And they said, they were
removed before the deluge.

00:24:37.861 --> 00:24:38.902 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They saved them.

00:24:38.902 --> 00:24:41.277 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: They say they were
removed before the deluge.

00:24:41.277 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:90%
They saved them.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And I never really
asked, back then,

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of follow up
questions, except that they

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
did have certain genetics and
knowledge that were valuable

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't
want to have lost.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Whoever they are.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And they said they were simply
flown out before the deluge.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you have
that opportunity

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
to ask that one question
to something, somebody,

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
to get that answer you've
always been looking for,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:90%
what would that question be?

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: OK.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:90%
I have had a question.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, came from
both Dolores Cannon's work

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and also from the beings
that I have spoken of.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we were
told many years ago--

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.330 align:middle line:90%
35 years ago, or so--

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that there is another
earth that has

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:84%
been formed, that we've reached
a point in consciousness

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
where you have such a
diversity in consciousness

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:84%
here that it's
really not serving

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:84%
all to be in the same
place at the same time.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You want to expedite
your lessons,

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying to make a fast
track, contributing to society,

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:90%
elevating your frequencies.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:84%
You want to be with people
you can do this with.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're slow on
the uptake on that,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:84%
say you're struggling with
the basics of survival,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:84%
just learning the basic
things, no rape, no murder.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.244 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you need to
be among people

00:25:54.244 --> 00:25:55.660 align:middle line:84%
that are learning
the same lessons

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.760 align:middle line:84%
so you can all
learn faster, right?

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was proposed
that there has already

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.377 align:middle line:84%
been a two-Earth scenario
that's been created,

00:26:03.377 --> 00:26:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and we won't know
the difference as we

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.990 align:middle line:84%
have amnesia at the end
of a given incarnation,

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:90%
before we re-enter.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And that that has
already been populated.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So my question is-- and same
thing came up in Dolores

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Cannon's work again and again--

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.250 align:middle line:90%
there's a two-Earth scenario.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.220 align:middle line:84%
My question is, which
Earth are we on?

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.145 align:middle line:90%
And how many are there?

00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Whether there are one, whether
there are two, or there

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:90%
are three.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:84%
If there's more than
one, is this the Earth?

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:84%
My feeling on that, even
though I don't have the answer,

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and I wish someone could tell
me, is that the Earth we're

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:84%
on right now-- because she is
lifting her own frequencies.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:84%
She will heal herself
if we stop kicking her.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Very rapidly.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.072 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the Gaia Theory.

00:26:45.072 --> 00:26:46.447 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: It's
the Gaia Theory.

00:26:46.447 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
That she, because she's
elevating her frequencies,

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
those who choose to stay with
her have to elevate theirs.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple vibrational match.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Either you match or you don't.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:90%
You get in or you don't.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm thinking that this
Earth is actually the one that

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:90%
will continue progressing.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:84%

located within the North Sea

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.820 align:middle line:10%
have been discovering the
remains of a drowned ancient

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:10%
city, which once spanned from
the UK all the way to Denmark.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:28.500 align:middle line:10%
An ancient city so massive,
its suspected population

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:10%
has been estimated well
into the tens of thousands.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:10%
A team of climatologists,
archaeologists,

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.140 align:middle line:10%
and geophysicists have
now successfully mapped

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.620 align:middle line:10%
the area, which has revealed
just how vast and expansive

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.290 align:middle line:10%
this once lost land once was.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:10%
Many specialists are now
claiming this was once

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.180 align:middle line:10%
the real heartland of Europe.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:10%
This enormous
civilization is now

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:10%
believed to have dated back
to some 8,000 years ago,

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.990 align:middle line:10%
and that the landmass
was submerged

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:10%
over a period of
several thousand years.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:01.500 align:middle line:84%

some 20,000 years prior.

reveals the human story
behind Doggerland,

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:10%
a now submerged city
of the North Sea

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.810 align:middle line:10%
that was once larger than many
modern European countries.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:10%
Could these discoveries
reveal Doggerland

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.680 align:middle line:10%
as the real lost
city of Atlantis?

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or the lost
continent of Atlantis?

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, through my
decades of research,

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:84%
I've been fascinated
with Atlantis.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And what I've come to
understand-- again,

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
this is my understanding,
my research--

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:90%
is that Atlantis actually--

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
it's far more ancient
than they believed.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
That it was concurrent
with Lemuria.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So, it already existed prior
to the loss of Lemuria.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So, there was that transit back
and forth between the peoples.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And that ancient Egypt
actually dates back--

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
the civilization dates
back 200,000 years.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:84%
It was concurrent
with Atlantis as well.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.180 align:middle line:84%
This starts
explaining artifacts.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But that Atlantis actually
went down in three stages.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.915 align:middle line:10%
The northern part chunked
off first, then the center--

00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:10.715 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Over time.

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Over time.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.440 align:middle line:10%
Over a very long period of time.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.090 align:middle line:10%
We lost the top,
which would be more

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.600 align:middle line:10%
what they're talking about.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.930 align:middle line:10%
Then it kept breaking
off down to what

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.920 align:middle line:10%
we look at around Portugal
and even more south than that.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And that as it broke off, the
highest knowledge, the highest

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.280 align:middle line:84%
civilizations were the
earliest ones up north.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And it became lowered
in consciousness

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.240 align:middle line:90%
to where warring set in.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It was peaceful,
initially, and beautiful.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.290 align:middle line:90%
And that warring set in.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:10%
By the time we lost Atlantis,
the final remnant of it,

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.200 align:middle line:10%
and what they say
is the great deluge,

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:10%
we did have warring
species and populations.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:84%
But still, some advance
technological and spiritual

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that basically
was emigrated off

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to various parts of Europe,
the Yucatan, and so forth.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.502 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:56.502 --> 00:29:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see any
opportunity for humans

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:84%
today, based on
things that happened

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.647 align:middle line:90%
in Atlantis a long time ago?

00:30:03.647 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Opportunities
toward what?

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:90%
What specifically?

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.213 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For bettering
our society and our lives?

00:30:09.213 --> 00:30:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Absolutely.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that there is
a wheel of reincarnation.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So, I argue that the very
people that were there,

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.920 align:middle line:84%
that had that
advanced knowledge--

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:84%
say, in the very
beginning of time.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Even the Lemurian knowledge--
a very deep understanding

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:84%
of how the cosmos and reality
and nature itself works,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.440 align:middle line:90%
and how to create.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.655 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:30:31.655 --> 00:30:32.530 align:middle line:90%
We're back right now.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is
tap into that memory.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's completely
accessible to us,

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.220 align:middle line:84%
depending on our desire to
work at it a little bit.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.920 align:middle line:84%
To be able to do that
vertical integration.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:90%
All the information's there.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We could be living literally on
a paradise on Earth right now.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
are advanced enough, Regina,

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.306 align:middle line:84%
to really tap into things
like that, and really get it?

00:30:55.306 --> 00:30:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I think only a
small percentage at this time.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.482 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:30:58.482 --> 00:31:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: But that
percentage is really--

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them are starting
to work in various ways

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:84%
to help inculcate that ability
and knowledge and the way

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.700 align:middle line:84%
to reach into oneself,
to the public at large.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
same spectrum exists

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.580 align:middle line:84%
whether you're in the dark
ages, Atlantis, or today.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.350 align:middle line:84%
You always have a
spectrum of people

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:84%
at the very top who are
the teachers, the ones who

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
have come to bring light, to
bring possibility and knowledge

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.200 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Then you have what they
call, I guess in advertising,

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:90%
the early adopters.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:middle line:84%
The ones that say, yeah,
I'm taking that on.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:90%
And they become teachers.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
those who are, yes,

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I would like to enhance
my understanding of life

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.780 align:middle line:90%
and my reality in this world.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you have those that are
just surviving and don't care.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that spectrum
stays roughly the same,

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.430 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.810 align:middle line:84%
You just all kind of rise
a little bit together,

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:90%
or fall together.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like the theories
of Michael Cremo, where

00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:10%
he believes mankind is way
older than people think,

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:10%
there was a fellow by
the name of Bartles

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.840 align:middle line:10%
who found 320 million
year old footprints.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.014 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:32:08.014 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, you just get
comfortable with the notion

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.910 align:middle line:84%
we've been around
a really long time.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:12.477 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long time.

00:32:12.477 --> 00:32:14.143 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: You don't
have to explain it

00:32:14.143 --> 00:32:15.290 align:middle line:90%
if there's evidence there.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Follow the thread.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And then start looking
at the collective memory

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.666 align:middle line:84%
that I talked about at the
very beginning of the show.

00:32:21.666 --> 00:32:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Where is that coming
up somewhere else?

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Where is there cross-validation
for that scientifically

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:90%
and intuitively?

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a
problem with the fact

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:34.700 align:middle line:84%
that we might even be, in Vedic
terms, billions of years old.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.120 align:middle line:90%
I have no problem with that.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are portal beings
and their influence on us?

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: In the story that
I speak of, the portal beings

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.580 align:middle line:84%
were the original high
consciousness, highly creative,

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:84%
highly intelligent beings
that existed in this space,

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:90%
in another dimension--

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But physical?

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Nonphysical.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Another dimension of
what we would call Earth.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Earth has many dimensions.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:84%
These beings existed, and as the
third dimension, this reality

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:84%
we're in here, this
physical reality,

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:84%
was coming into
fruition, into creation,

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:15.120 align:middle line:84%
they threw an anomaly that
the beings call a portal, had

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:84%
the ability to simply peer
in on this happening that

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.410 align:middle line:84%
was occurring here, this
development of this incredibly

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.200 align:middle line:84%
interesting planet, because of
the diversity of life forms.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.750 align:middle line:84%
They had the ability
to initially peer in.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And over time, they
had the ability

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:84%
to go through this
area that was almost

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:84%
like a portal
between dimensions.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Almost like a wormhole.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.440 align:middle line:90%
But we wouldn't call it that.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:84%
It was an area-- they call
it, almost of a plasticity--

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that allowed what's
not normally allowed.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
A being from one
dimensional band

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to reach in and blend with,
observe, and ultimately

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.580 align:middle line:84%
tinker with, a little bit,
another dimensional world.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.850 align:middle line:90%
That's not normal.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:57.692 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they all benevolent
when they make that transition?

00:33:57.692 --> 00:34:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: The original portal
beings that were spoken of,

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:90%
it was benevolent.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.580 align:middle line:90%
They were just curious.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.280 align:middle line:84%
They were just there
because they could be there.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the fascination
with density and with body,

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.940 align:middle line:84%
with being able to merge with
a fish or a simple species--

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.630 align:middle line:84%
a bird-- and feel
this sensory input

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:22.409 align:middle line:84%
there was fascinating to
them, according to this story.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.110 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, they
stayed too long.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:84%
More complex life forms were
being created at that time,

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:84%
and that is really
the problem of what

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:36.510 align:middle line:84%
became the human dilemma of
being a highly electrical,

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.070 align:middle line:84%
electrically charged,
shimmering, intelligent,

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.659 align:middle line:84%
creative force that ultimately
was put in the position

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.510 align:middle line:84%
to merge with the
most developed animal

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.510 align:middle line:84%
body on the planet of the
day, which is basically this.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.310 align:middle line:90%
The human.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.939 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are they
still interacting with us?

00:34:50.939 --> 00:34:51.719 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: They're
not interacting.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:90%
They are us.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:90%
They merged.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:53.489 align:middle line:90%
They're one.

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:54.091 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are who they are.

00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:55.424 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: We are who they are.

00:34:55.424 --> 00:35:00.000 align:middle line:84%
At our core is this vastly
intelligent, creative--

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.450 align:middle line:84%
the thing that makes
us cry at valor or cry

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.360 align:middle line:84%
at beauty, no other
animal on this planet

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.490 align:middle line:90%
cries at these things.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It affects us on
such a deep level

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that we can't even
explain it ourselves.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:16.950 align:middle line:84%
That is the part that is
the very elevated, creative,

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:84%
highly intelligent,
advanced, shimmery,

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:24.660 align:middle line:84%
electrical being that
ultimately merged with flesh.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we're trapped between
the two on one level.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But we're also one of the
most splendid experiments

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:84%
in the universe because
we have the ability

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.770 align:middle line:90%
of merging two worlds.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:38.152 align:middle line:90%
And it's just not done that way.

00:35:38.152 --> 00:35:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Through the years, it's been
expressed over and over.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.210 align:middle line:90%
This is not done.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:84%
This species is a
very unusual one.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:10%
And in the hermetic
order, they say

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:10%
that the angels bow
their head in shame

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:57.060 align:middle line:10%
before a human that has been
able to raise themselves up

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:10%
into a high level
of consciousness

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.430 align:middle line:10%
because it's so difficult to
do in this human spectrum,

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:06.300 align:middle line:10%
in this world with time
and density and resistance

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.410 align:middle line:10%
all around.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:12.540 align:middle line:84%
To be able to break through and
be a truly elevated, divinely

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.570 align:middle line:90%
behaved human is not easy.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And they say the greatest
beings in the universe

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.430 align:middle line:90%
bow when that happens.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:90%
That's a thought.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Regina, thanks
for being on Beyond Belief.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Thank you so much
for having me on, George.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And good luck with
all your programs, too.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Thank you so much.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Open Minds and
so many other things.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.000 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Regina
Meredith is probably

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:38.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the top experts in
the field of consciousness

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:90%
and developmental history.

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you've got to
watch her program on Gaia.com

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.720 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Open Minds.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.
