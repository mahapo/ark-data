>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and
our special guest tonight

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:90%
is Jason Quitt.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:10%
Jason is a researcher who really
dives into the consciousness

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:10%
end of it, and he's an author.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.890 align:middle line:84%
His book is called
"Forbidden Knowledge."

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And Jason, welcome
to the program.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're always upbeat
every time I meet you.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON QUITT: Thank you,
and thank you for having me.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's new?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:10%
>>QUITT: What's new is
just traveling, working,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:10%
and researching more
on consciousness

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:10%
and pushing myself with
different meditations

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:10%
and Qigong to
explore other worlds.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you evolve
into the area of consciousness?

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm convinced when
you're a little kid in school,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking about
consciousness are you?

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Not at all.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was something that
was just happening naturally.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, I would
actually have past life memories

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
coming to me.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:84%
As a child I would have
visitations at night when

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.047 align:middle line:84%
I would go to sleep, different
beings and different shadows

00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
would wake me up in the
middle of the night.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Friendly and otherwise?

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Friendly and otherwise.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh uh.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And most of the
time, it was very frightening,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and it was just passed
off as nightmares.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And I just believed that
every person on Earth

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.809 align:middle line:84%
experienced the same
nightmares as me.

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But we didn't, did we?

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: No.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I found that out later
in life that when

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I would explain to my friends
about don't you remember

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:90%
this past life we had together?

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
For me that was very
normal, and they

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
would look at me come
kind of dumbfounded,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:90%
like what am I talking about.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that maybe
people didn't see the world

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:90%
like I saw the world.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of pushed it
out of my mind growing up.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And then in my
early 20s, I started

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:84%
to really get involved again,
but it was not by choice.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I started to have
experiences again.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is what many
people are coming forward

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:90%
with now.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
They're saying that
they're experiencers.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
experience something that's

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.440 align:middle line:90%
beyond the physical world.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when
you say not by choice,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that means to me that
something forced your hand.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Is that what happened?

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Something
did force my hand.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And the way that it happened
was through a series of events

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:84%
of sleep paralysis, and I
think there is many Americans

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and people all around
the world that experience

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.569 align:middle line:90%
a form of sleep paralysis.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is a horrible
feeling, by the way.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Because you just you feel like
you're locked and strangled

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing you can do.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:90%
You can't move.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:90%
You're rigid.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a horrible feeling.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: It's terrifying.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And you wake up
basically paralyzed,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're screaming
inside your own mind,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
saying wake up or move a
finger or do something.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like you're trapped.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're not quite
sure if it's a dream or not,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
but then you realize,
oh no it's not a dream.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I can't move.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And it, I think Jason it
could be a split second,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:84%
but it feels like it's
10 minutes, doesn't it?

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It's very terrifying, and all
you want to do is wake up.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So when people ask you
know you're just dreaming,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it's an
actual state between waking

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and dreaming where you are
conscious of the physical self

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and body, but you can't move
or control what's happening.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been
hit with the old hag syndrome?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Oh yes.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes, and those are the worst.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.750 align:middle line:90%
It feels like literally--

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain that for people
who don't know what that is.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: The old hag syndrome,
it's basically waking up

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like you have
another person climbing up

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
on your body and suffocating
you or crushing you

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:90%
where you can't breathe.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:84%
And many people, when they
have these experiences,

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.610 align:middle line:90%
they can't open their eyes.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So they can't see
what's going on.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
They can just feel
what's happening to them.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.575 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, with me,
I could open my eyes

00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and see these things.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You saw the hag?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It doesn't-- for me it
just looked like a shadow with

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:90%
mass.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
That's what it
looked like to me.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a heavy shadow with mass.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And when it climbs up
on you, it definitely

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
feels like something is
getting into bed with you,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
getting on top of you, and
suddenly you're frozen.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:90%
You can't breathe.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
You're being crushed,
and all you want to do

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is scream and get out
of this situation.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was a kid,
I had that old hag syndrome,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and distinctly remember
the haggish looking face.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
begging for whatever

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
was out there to end
this, because it scared

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:90%
the living daylights out of me.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, the hag just kind

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.600 align:middle line:84%
of like floated up
and disappeared.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And I am convinced to this day
it was the old hag syndrome.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Had to be.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And many
people experience this,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and some people experience it
and they see a shadow walking

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:90%
around the room.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they see
a shadow that's

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.025 align:middle line:84%
wearing a hat, which is
a very strange thing.

00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a shadow man?

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: A shadow man
that wears a hat or--

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tall hat.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Tall hats.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Or they look like a grim
reaper where they're cloaked.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I would be in
the sleep paralysis state,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I would actually feel something
walking around the room

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:90%
while I'm in this state.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I could also sometimes feel
this thing would sit on my bed

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and there would
be a weight to it.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:84%
The bed would actually move
like someone is actually

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:90%
sitting on the bed.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
sickly as a child?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they sometimes say if an
old hag visits you quite a bit,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to develop
sicknesses and illnesses as you

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:90%
grow up.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Did that happen to you?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, I completely
agree with that.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.794 align:middle line:84%
Growing up I always had
a condition called IBS.

00:06:28.794 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It's called
irritable bowel

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, which means anything
that I ate made me sick.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: So it was
almost like growing up

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.300 align:middle line:90%
I was allergic to food.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You couldn't
hold down anything.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I couldn't
hold down anything.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So I became very,
very skinny where

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
you can see the
bones in my body,

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and I was basically having
one foot in this world

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and one foot into
the other world.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've probably
always have been tall, right?

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: I've always been tall.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So for me, being 6
foot 5", to weigh,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.995 align:middle line:84%
I think the lowest I
weighed was around 140, 150.

00:07:01.995 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's thin.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: That's very thin, so
I was about 30 to 40 pounds

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:90%
underweight.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:90%
So for me that's very unhealthy.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Blame it
on the old hag.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I think that
when a person is sick,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
their body starts
to become weakened.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Their electromagnetic
field becomes

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
weakened, which
allows them to shift

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
into this world and
the other world.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we start to merge or be
awakened into that other world,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
we're introduced to

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.830 align:middle line:84%
is this fourth dimension
or this astral world where

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
these type of beings
inhabit, and we

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.434 align:middle line:90%
start to become sensitive.

00:07:42.434 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
talked to your parents

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:84%
about these things, what
did they say to you?

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, when I was a
child and I said, let's say,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
a shadow was in
the room with me,

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:84%
they would just say
it's a nightmare.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Later in life, in
my early 20s when

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I would describe
what was happening,

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.654 align:middle line:84%
they would want me to
see a psychiatrist.

00:08:03.654 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
send you to one?

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: No.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.512 align:middle line:84%
Luckily I was over
the age of 18.

00:08:07.512 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You decided
I'm not going.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: I decided.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
No, because I know
that what I'm saying

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:90%
is crazy to the normal person.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: I know that it is.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's far
out for somebody.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Right.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you also know
it's happening to you.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.531 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes, and I'm not alone.

00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're not alone.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.580 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: There are millions of
people that experience this,

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and many people don't
have the courage

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to tell their friends and family
that this experience happened

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.059 align:middle line:90%
to them as well.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:38.914 align:middle line:84%
And they just kind
of pass it off,

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
lot of belief systems

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.666 align:middle line:84%
that are in place that kind
of hold this information down.

00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old
were you, Jason,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
when you had your first
out-of-body experience?

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say more
consciously was when I was 22.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So late.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Late in life, basically.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I was 11 when I
had my first one.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, I mean I
was having them as a child

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:84%
all the time, but
for me I just thought

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:90%
it was part of dreaming.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't aware that this
was something special.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
It was only until later
in life that I realized

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that what I was
actually doing was what

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:90%
we would call astral traveling.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
enjoy the travel?

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: At first it
scared me to death,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
but it was like opening
up another world to me

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was so curious of
what was on the other side

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.597 align:middle line:90%
of the outer body experience.

00:09:29.597 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It's absolutely
fascinating, so it drove me.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter how fearful I
was of what could be out there,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there was
something out there

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:90%
and I could have access to it.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of motivated
me and drove me forward

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.747 align:middle line:90%
to explore this new world.

00:09:47.747 --> 00:09:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So in my case,
I was on the ceiling

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:84%
looking down at my
11-year-old body and just

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:90%
kind of like hovering around.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Did you go anywhere?

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.394 align:middle line:84%
Did you travel in
your astral body?

00:09:57.394 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: At first, no.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:90%
At first I was too scared.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So I would push
myself out of my body,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and I would just
float above the bed.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I can see
myself in the bed.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:90%
It's very similar to--

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.002 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's weird.

00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It's a
very weird feeling,

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's like a
near-death experience

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:90%
that people describe.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: So I would be
completely disassociated

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
from the body and be able to
look at myself laying in bed,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and I would just kind of
float around the room.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I became
more confident,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
then I would explore
outside the bedroom

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.965 align:middle line:90%
and then outside of the house.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a chance to
interview on the program

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Sonja Grace, who's
a mystic healer,

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and she talks a lot about
what happened to you.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: As a spirit traveler,
can you get into trouble?

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:10%
Can you get stuck
in an area that you

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't be traveling?

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:10%
>>SONJA GRACE: I can, and
I'm very careful to never go

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:10%
anywhere without my guides.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.175 align:middle line:10%
My guides are the ones that take
me and move me through time.

00:10:59.175 --> 00:11:00.633 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You trust
them, obviously.

00:11:00.633 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:10%
And you know you could call it
time travel because I do end up

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:10%
in a different
time period, but I

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:10%
don't go anywhere without them.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:10%
They navigate where I'm going
and how I'm getting there.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:10%
There is something
that I work with

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:10%
and that I talked about in my
book "Become an Earth Angel,"

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:10%
and that's the--

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's
this one right here.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: That's the fifth
dimension that we're in now.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.440 align:middle line:10%
We're in the fifth dimension.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:10%
We moved out of the fourth
dimension into the fifth.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.320 align:middle line:10%
And then there's energy
called the realms,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:10%
and those are two
different things.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:10%
Our whole galaxy is in
the fifth dimension,

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:10%
so it's this higher
frequency, higher vibration.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:10%
But the realms are different
energies that we can exist in.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:10%
Most of Earth and people
are in the second realm.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:10%
Some people have moved
into the third realm.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:10%
They're a little calmer.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:10%
They like to communicate more.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where would
we be right about now?

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.086 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: In the third.

00:11:58.086 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:90%
In the third realm.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:10%
And high, really
evolved beings move

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:10%
into the fourth
realm, fifth realm,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.152 align:middle line:10%
sixth realm, seventh realm.

00:12:07.152 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:10%
That's where you're going
to find a lot of ETs.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.456 align:middle line:10%
That's where a lot of the
extraterrestrials exist.

00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: they your
spirit guides?

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:10%
These ETs?

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: No.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:10%
No my spirit guides are angels.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:10%
And I work--

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How many do you have?

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: I work
only with angels.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.709 align:middle line:10%
There's about five of them.

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Five spirit guides
all at the same time?

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Yeah, and I've
seen them since I was--

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:10%
my earliest memory
was two years old.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.999 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do they all
have separate duties?

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: They've been with
me through all my lifetimes.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But do they have
different responsibilities?

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.019 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Yes, they do.

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean, like
one takes care of you

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:10%
from getting into an accident.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Right.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One takes care of
you from health purposes.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:10%
Are they like that?

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: They work
more as a group.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:10%
They work more
together on things.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:10%
There are certain ones that will
help me with certain things.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:10%
But for the most part,
we travel as a group.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.927 align:middle line:10%
And they make sure all
of my traveling is safe.

00:13:00.927 --> 00:13:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now on the
face of it, Jason.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
One would say, come
on now, you're nuts.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.430 align:middle line:90%
You know otherwise.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.740 align:middle line:90%
She's not nuts.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: No.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
No this is a very
common experience,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and she's actually
explaining it very well.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So when I do leave my body,
sometimes there are guides.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.696 align:middle line:90%
I don't really see them.

00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:90%
For me they kind of--

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.694 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you feel them.

00:13:22.694 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: They'll
stand behind me,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:90%
and they'll take me on journeys.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So I could feel somebody
holding my shoulder.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's not like--

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
it's like, the people say, when
you leave your body can you

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:90%
go to wherever you want to go?

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is never.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm never in control
of where I go.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
When I leave my body suddenly
there's almost like something

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
there that decides I'm going
to show or take Jason here.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you leave
at will out of your body?

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: In the
right circumstances,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually in the
early morning hours.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.344 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
wake up too early,

00:14:02.344 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:84%
let's say it's
4:00 in the morning

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and you could easily
fall back asleep.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:84%
That time I could very
easily move out of the body.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is it that way?

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: I think it's--

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.856 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why does that work?

00:14:13.856 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I think it's because
your body is already asleep,

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and your mind is already in
the brain wave frequencies.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're relaxed.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Right.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about the
brain wave frequencies.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:84%
When your brain waves
are in a certain state,

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy to kind
of move in and out

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
of these fields of awareness.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you feel yourself
going into that awareness,

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:84%
that in-between state, you can
actually shift your awareness

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:84%
into that realm or dimension
in which she was talking about.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonja talked about
having five spirit guides that

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:90%
helped her.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a certain
amount, a number?

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: No, no.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:84%
But I've been visited by
many different beings.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.064 align:middle line:90%
Most of them, they look like--

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't want to say
this-- but it's almost

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
like a Jedi master.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Where they look
like they're cloaked.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:90%
So they're wearing these cloaks.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.304 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're like--

00:15:07.304 --> 00:15:09.887 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just don't want to
see a bony finger sticking out

00:15:09.887 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:90%
of the thing.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Stay away from those.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Stay away from those.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%
But you can't see their face.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the one thing that
I've never seen, a face.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they've
got hoods over them.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.139 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: They have hoods
over, and you can't see them.

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And they will sometimes
give me information

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:90%
or take me on journeys.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll
look like shadows.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'll wake
up and there will be,

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
let's say a being that
we would consider alien,

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:90%
in the room with you.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.794 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen many
different types of these.

00:15:36.794 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want, Jason?

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:90%
What's their end game plan here?

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: For me, I
think it's like they're

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
trying to show me that there is
more to life than the 3D world,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:84%
that we have access to a
whole other space and time,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
these other realms
that they live in.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's many different beings
on these different dimensions

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:90%
or realms.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:90%
And they assist us.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:90%
They guide us.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:90%
They teach us.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
beings there that

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:84%
are doing the opposite, which
are manipulating us or making

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:90%
us sick.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's almost like a
balance of these different types

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:90%
of beings.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can you distinguish
the difference between the two,

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.610 align:middle line:84%
those that are
trying to help you

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and those that are
trying to hurt you?

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, you'll
definitely feel it.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I've woken up with
different entities trying

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to pull me out of my body
or take energy or even

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:90%
put sickness in the body.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
call them demons?

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, a demon would
be a very good word for them.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:90%
I would just call them entities.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just look at them as
beings trying to survive,

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and it's just in
a different way.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.086 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for life force.

00:16:51.086 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
demons surround you?

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you seem like someone
who's got it together.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:84%
You understand the
world of consciousness.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:90%
You seem very positive.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.666 align:middle line:90%
Why would a demon approach you?

00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say
that they may like

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.849 align:middle line:90%
the energy that I'm carrying.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that
every person on the planet

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
carries traumas,
they carry wounds,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:84%
they carry things that
they may keep within them.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, these beings

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.540 align:middle line:84%
could track and connect
to those energies

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.582 align:middle line:84%
and use them to take
energy from you.

00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
people have tried

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
to go through portals
on this planet

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:84%
to get to other worlds
or other dimensions.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I think
it's absolutely true.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And I actually travel through
these portals in an outer body

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.300 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
once I leave the body,

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.717 align:middle line:84%
there will be a portal
that may open up

00:17:49.717 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
in different locations
in the bedroom.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.966 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
going intentionally?

00:17:52.966 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: No, it's
like a magnetic pull.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah ha.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: So you
see, you visually

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:84%
see these things open
up, and they just

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.250 align:middle line:84%
look like these
black round disks.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're very small.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're big
to fit the whole body.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.447 align:middle line:90%
And you get pulled.

00:18:09.447 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like you get sucked.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a magnetic
pull coming through the body

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:84%
or through the chest, and you
get pulled into these portals.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very interesting
experience actually traveling

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:90%
through these portals.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:84%
The only way I could
describe it is,

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:84%
you know the old TVs where
you don't have a channel

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.185 align:middle line:84%
and you have that
static on the screen?

00:18:34.185 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh huh.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: That's what it--

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Noise, we call it.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: It's noise.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:90%
It's white noise.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you're traveling
through it, you see white noise

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:90%
but it's the negative of that.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's like black noise.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you scared?

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: No.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:90%
No fear at all.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:90%
No fear.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
You actually feel a
great acceleration.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the white noise
kind of passing your ears,

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:90%
even though you don't have ears.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It feels like
you're accelerating

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.429 align:middle line:84%
and there's a wind going past
your ears very, very fast.

00:19:04.429 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's on the other
side of the portal, Jason?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Sometimes
you get dropped off

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:90%
in space, which happens a lot.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'll go through a portal
and I'll end up in space

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and we can see different
planets or stars.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be fun.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It's very fun,
and then at that point,

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
I would have the guide
behind me holding me

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
by the back of the
shoulder, and they

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:84%
would take me into the world
or where they're taking me.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever had that fear

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:90%
that you could not get back?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I actually
have the opposite fear,

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.940 align:middle line:84%
which is that I want these
experiences to last longer,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.125 align:middle line:90%
and it's very hard for them to--

00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they end they
end on their own, don't they?

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: They just end on, yes.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're back
in your body just abrupt.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, and you're
like I wanted more.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So these
out-of-body experiences

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:84%
are different for
a lot of people.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
William Bramley, one of the
authors of "Gods of Eden,"

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
talks about out-of-body
experiences the way

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.714 align:middle line:90%
he perceives it.

00:19:58.714 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM BRAMLEY: These
types of theories all point

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:10%
to these different
contiguous realms

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:10%
that because we are using these
three dimensional bodies which

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:10%
are programmed and adapted
for this particular world,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:10%
generally speaking,
we are restricted

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:10%
to the perceptions and the
operations in this world.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:10%
And it's only after the
consciousness leaves the body

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:10%
that it starts to experience
for the most part that broader

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:10%
realm.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:84%
When a person has an
out-of-body experience,

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:84%
they continue to see their
body, like the typical one

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:90%
in the hospital.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.321 align:middle line:90%
They go out of the body.

00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:90%
They still see the body.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.444 align:middle line:90%
They still see the doctors.

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
They still see the
hospital, but then they're

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.474 align:middle line:90%
also seeing this light.

00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:41.890 align:middle line:84%
They're also seeing
these tunnels.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:84%
They may be seeing
what they think

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:90%
are guardian angels coming in.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:10%
And that's all part
of the same picture,

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:10%
but it takes releasing
from the body

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.510 align:middle line:10%
to be able to see those broader
things that are just really

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:10%
in some sense part of
us, but there's still

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:10%
a wall of separation.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:10%
And so the star gate
so to speak might

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:10%
be that point where the gods
and where these entities kind

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:10%
of come through.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:90%
They go back and forth.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pretty interesting
description wasn't it?

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Very accurate.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Very accurate.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I could feel these
beings step into the room,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:84%
but I can't see them
with my physical eyes.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
know they're there.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Right.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I know they're there, but
when I pop out of my body

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:84%
they're standing right there
in front of me plain as day.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
disembodied spirits?

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Are they the souls of the dead?

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Sometimes you'll have
the dead coming to visit you,

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.030 align:middle line:84%
because you could help
them or assist them.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
time, I would say

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
they're inter-dimensional or are
multi-dimensional beings that

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
exist in those realms, and
they're coming at certain times

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
in your life to awaken you
to show you that you yourself

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:84%
are a multi-dimensional
being that have access

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.490 align:middle line:84%
to the same worlds and
portals that they do.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
the Spider's Web portal.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: This is a
very interesting thing,

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and this is what one of the
beings that came to visit me

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:90%
that wore the robe told me.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.754 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha

00:22:13.754 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And they
told me a story, which

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:90%
I found very, very interesting.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And they said that a very
long time ago in our history

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that many universes, many
civilizations were all

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.400 align:middle line:84%
connected by something called
the Great Spider's Web.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was a network
of portals that

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
was placed in many worlds where
once you can leave your body,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
you can go and travel these
portals to visit people

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and family and friends and other
beings in different timelines,

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.110 align:middle line:84%
in different dimensions,
and on different planets.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So we had access at one time in
our history to leave our bodies

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and travel these Spider
Webs to have communication

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:90%
and experiences on many worlds.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now these portals
that are out there,

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:84%
do they connect you,
Jason, to other universes?

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, in fact this being
that describe the spider's web

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
to me says that the
spider's web alone

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
would give me access to seven
other parallel universes.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seven?

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.369 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Seven.

00:23:25.369 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In these other
parallel universes,

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:90%
what could one expect?

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.805 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: You would see yourself.

00:23:31.805 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In each one?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: In each one,
and you're living

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:90%
almost the same existence.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you'll wake
up in these parallel worlds

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
where you're still you but
you have a different history

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You have a different
group of friends.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:84%
You may live in a different
location, but it's still you

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:90%
and it still looks like you.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:84%
There's also sometimes
when you wake up

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.710 align:middle line:84%
in these parallel worlds and
you're looking like an alien.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So you have different
types of bodies

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:90%
in different types of worlds.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have
these experiences

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
done for you in terms
of your life as a human,

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:90%
as Jason Quitt?

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:90%
What has it done for you?

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It's
actually very freeing.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
freeing because you

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:84%
know that your
consciousness exists

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
outside of the physical world
and will continue to exist.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And that the human body
is just a vessel for you

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:84%
to experience this
world at this time.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But we're also living
in a multi-verse

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and we're having many
experiences all the time

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that
time is moving forward,

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
but when we leave our bodies
and we leave time and space,

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
we can easily jump into
our past and we can easily

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:84%
jump into our future to learn
from those experiences too.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Does this make you
more perceptive?

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Does it make you more psychic?

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:84%
It makes you more
sensitive and aware.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So like I said when the
beings come into the room

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I can feel their presence
when they step into the room.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I can feel, let's say, if
it's a good or a bad energy.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's a
bad energy, they'll

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
be pulling out my energy
or trying to get at me.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.540 align:middle line:90%
And then I could put up shields.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But you get this
kind of awareness

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical
body, and it would

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:84%
be kind of a
multi-dimensional awareness.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And when we get
sick, for example,

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:84%
or something's not
right, sometimes it's

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.320 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual explanation
and we can leave our body

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and actually look
at our self and see

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:84%
what is attached to
us, what is wrong,

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:90%
what is causing us to be sick.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can work on ourselves
from that outer body

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:84%
When we come back to
the body and wake up,

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that illness, that
sickness is gone.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
know that they are not

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:90%
causing the sickness?

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Sometimes
they are, actually.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:26:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, you carry this
electromagnetic field with you,

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and this electromagnetic field
or this consciousness field,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.970 align:middle line:84%
it tells your body
what it needs to do.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So if a being let's
say attaches to you

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and they are carrying
different energies--

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do you
know it's attached to you?

00:26:14.315 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, if I
would leave my body

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I could actually see
these things grab onto me.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.036 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if,
but if you don't.

00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel something?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'll feel like
a pulling or a pinching

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
or a weird illness, or you'll
have very strange thoughts

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:90%
or emotions.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to feel emotions
that you would not normally

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:90%
feel.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.320 align:middle line:10%
And those are all
very good signs

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.900 align:middle line:10%
that you have some type
of spiritual attachment.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:44.110 align:middle line:10%
And you would go to see someone
like a shaman or someone that

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:10%
can see outside
the physical world.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So that they can then remove
these spiritual intrusions

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to allow your energy
to flow again.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is
something attached to you,

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:84%
it's causing a disturbance in
your electromagnetic field,

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:84%
which would then have
physical ramifications.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever at
any point invite them in?

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Have you created this
environment yourself, maybe

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:90%
unwillingly but you did?

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: What I was told is that
the reason I'm just sensitive

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
like this in this life is
because I've done this many

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:84%
times in other lives so
it's something that I'm used

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to having these experiences I
would think sickness is one way

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:84%
of inviting these things in,
because you're actually--

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Drugs, alcohol,
that does that too.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Oh yes, like
addictions or obsessions,

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:90%
you're drawing energy to you.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Because everything is energy.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And let's say, for example,
someone's addicted to alcohol.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll have beings, or
multi-dimensional energies,

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:90%
that love the energy of alcohol.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So when you consume
it, you're putting out

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that frequency of the
spirit of alcohol,

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and then it will
draw these beings

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:84%
to you which also
enjoy that frequency.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a
parasite is to a host,

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I would assume they want to do
as much as they can to damage

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
you, but they don't want
to kill you because if they

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.700 align:middle line:90%
do they lose you.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Exactly.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So you'll get people that
are walking around that

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:90%
are literally walking zombies.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're
just being pulled

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.994 align:middle line:90%
to places with no control.

00:28:24.994 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes when you
wake up and you feel that way,

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.580 align:middle line:84%
has something happened
to you overnight?

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, before I knew
I had these abilities,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I would wake up feeling
more tired and drained

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:90%
than I went to sleep with.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
go to see a shaman,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and they would say you
were traveling at night

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and you picked up
these hitchhikers.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you come back, you
have all these energies

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:90%
that are now connected to you.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have a
strong energy to begin with,

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:90%
it can be very damaging to you.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started to leave
my body, a lot of these beings

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:08.010 align:middle line:84%
they would start to teach me
healing techniques like Qigong,

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and they said it was
absolutely necessary for me

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to practice these things because
it helps rebuild and strengthen

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:84%
my energy fields so that I
could be healthy and travel

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:90%
in these worlds.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Two authors
back in the 1800s,

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:10%
Sylvan Muldoon and
Hayward Carrington

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.420 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book called "Projections
of the Astral Body,"

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:32.610 align:middle line:10%
and they said that there are
levels in planes of existence

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.150 align:middle line:10%
that you go through that
you don't want to stop.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.710 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be there.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.610 align:middle line:84%
They said that they are
so horrendous that you

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.770 align:middle line:84%
want to move to the
next level pretty fast.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.975 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever experience that?

00:29:45.975 --> 00:29:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I've experienced some
very terrifying places that

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:84%
would only be described as
what the end of the world

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.865 align:middle line:90%
would look like.

00:29:54.865 --> 00:29:55.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh jeez.

00:29:55.665 --> 00:29:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: So very terrifying
places, and yes you

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:90%
do want to move through them.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:84%
But, I think it's part
of the healing process

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.645 align:middle line:84%
to actually go through these
levels and get through.

00:30:07.645 --> 00:30:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And witness that?

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: It changes you.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:90%
It really changes you.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.460 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up from
these experiences,

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.580 align:middle line:84%
you're not the same person that
you were that night before.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.180 align:middle line:84%
What are physical
portals, Jason?

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I believe that
just as the astral worlds

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and these dimensions
have portals,

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.870 align:middle line:84%
the physical world has
these same portals.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And it does the
exact same things.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And we have portals opening
up naturally over the planet

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:90%
And all the time.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And right now this
is being proven

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:84%
by NASA and Professor
Jack Scudder

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.570 align:middle line:90%
from the University of Iowa.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What have they found?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: What they
discovered, that in space

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.700 align:middle line:84%
when the solar
winds from the sun

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.340 align:middle line:84%
hit the electromagnetic
fields of the Earth,

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:05.640 align:middle line:84%
where those two points cross,
it opens up a physical portal

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.200 align:middle line:90%
that takes away time and space.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So they're observing these now
outside of the Earth in the--

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I think it's about 10
kilometers or 10 miles outside

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.140 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth's magnetic field.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.760 align:middle line:90%
And so they're observing these.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're there?

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And they're
happening all the time.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they opening
and closing constantly?

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: They're opening
and closing constantly,

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and some actually maintain the
portal for quite a long time.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we have had a
guest named David Paulides.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:84%
He appears with me on
Coast to Coast quite a bit.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:84%
He's written a book
called "Missing 411."

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:84%
He has a theory that there
are many thousands of people

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:84%
who are disappearing
from this planet,

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.230 align:middle line:90%
and nobody knows where they are.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're being
abducted by an animal

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.400 align:middle line:84%
or sucked up by a
UFO or whatever,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.550 align:middle line:84%
he's got a lot of
different theories.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But secretly he has
one specific theory

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.420 align:middle line:84%
that he doesn't want to let
us in on, because I think

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:90%
he thinks it's so frightening.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think what it
is, is that people

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.510 align:middle line:84%
are stumbling into
these physical portals,

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:16.530 align:middle line:84%
just walking into them, and
they can't find their way back.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:17.454 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:32:17.454 --> 00:32:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, and
you hear stories

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.500 align:middle line:84%
about this through time,
especially in the Middle Ages

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
where they called
them fairy circles.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Where people would walk
out into the woods and they

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.747 align:middle line:84%
would end up in
this fairy circle.

00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:30.038 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then they're gone.

00:32:30.038 --> 00:32:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: They're gone
forever, or you'll

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:84%
have people walking
out of the forest

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.454 align:middle line:84%
asking them what
time period it is,

00:32:37.454 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:84%
because they just
walked into the forest

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and when they walked
back out it's 200,

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:90%
300 years in the future.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, talking
about ancient civilizations

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and portals to the
universe, look at this.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SPEAKER: Places like Gobekli
Tepe, or certainly the area

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:57.340 align:middle line:10%
around Gobekli Tepe in southeast
Turkey, the area around

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:04.582 align:middle line:10%
Giza in Egypt, and other places
like Stonehenge in England,

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:08.475 align:middle line:10%
they form part of what might
be described as an Earth grid.

00:33:08.475 --> 00:33:13.750 align:middle line:10%
And there were reasons for
establishing these places.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:10%
They all have something
in common with each other,

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:10%
and if you ask me what
that is, I would probably

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.330 align:middle line:10%
say that it's geomagnetic
anomalies, the appearance

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:29.320 align:middle line:10%
of strange light phenomena
what we would call UFOs today,

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.010 align:middle line:10%
the manifestation of
supernatural forms,

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:10%
supernatural entities, and
the idea that you can achieve

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.160 align:middle line:10%
altered states of
consciousness more easily

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:10%
at these places than elsewhere.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, so there
could be portals everywhere.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, and
in ancient times

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:56.470 align:middle line:84%
they would build their sacred
sites on these special ley

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.090 align:middle line:90%
lines and points.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would they know?

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.528 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: How would they know?

00:34:00.528 --> 00:34:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Because back then it was a
different electromagnetic

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:05.030 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:84%
The electromagnetic
field of the planet

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:84%
was actually a lot stronger
than it is right now.

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
So they could actually sense
where to build these sites more

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.156 align:middle line:90%
than we can today.

00:34:16.156 --> 00:34:17.739 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
have instruments.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have little Geiger
counters or anything like that.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say it has
to do with magnetic anomalies.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.874 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dowsing rods maybe?

00:34:25.874 --> 00:34:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: They could use
dowsing rods for sure,

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.489 align:middle line:90%
or they could just feel it.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Or they could even
just observe nature

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and they can see that
trees, certain trees are

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:84%
growing towards these points
or certain natural phenomenon.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.949 align:middle line:84%
So you would see
lights in the sky.

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:43.060 align:middle line:90%
You can see UFOs.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.179 align:middle line:84%
People would have spiritual
experiences at these places,

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:84%
because these places
were natural portals

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.889 align:middle line:90%
to the multi-dimensional world.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that these
points on the planet

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
were very, very
sacred, so they would

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.830 align:middle line:90%
start to build stone circles.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.970 align:middle line:84%
They would start to build
temples at these locations.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Because at certain times the
sun would let's say, release

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:84%
some solar wind and it will hit
the magnetic field of the Earth

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and would activate the ley
lines so that these points would

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.960 align:middle line:84%
actually open up
natural portal systems

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that these ancient people
could actually travel through

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:21.400 align:middle line:90%
to other places.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes beings, physical
beings, would walk out.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Walk out?

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.606 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they had
been there for how long?

00:35:30.606 --> 00:35:32.650 align:middle line:90%
For who knows how long, right?

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Right,
and these could be

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.840 align:middle line:84%
what we would consider
beings from other planets

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.870 align:middle line:84%
or dimensions or very
advanced beings that

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:46.760 align:middle line:84%
would come to the planet and
teach humans about astronomy,

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.149 align:middle line:90%
physics, science.

00:35:48.149 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think UFOs
travel through these portals

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.600 align:middle line:84%
as well to get from
time and space?

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I've seen
them travel like this.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have?

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:90%
What have you seen?

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I've witnessed
this glowing ship.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It was this orange light
ship, and it was clear as day.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking
at it in the sky.

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like someone
took a light dimmer switch

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.174 align:middle line:90%
and just turned it off.

00:36:12.174 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As if it went
into the portal, right?

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Right.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.350 align:middle line:84%
This portal kind
of enveloped it,

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and it just turned black
and gone instantly.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And gone.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Just gone.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And I knew right then
that these ships are not

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:31.156 align:middle line:84%
traveling through space, they're
traveling through portals.

00:36:31.156 --> 00:36:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
only way to get here.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.430 align:middle line:84%
They can't be using
propulsion systems.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.090 align:middle line:90%
They'd be traveling forever.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And the most
amazing thing about portals

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.290 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not bound
by time or space.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So they can go into
let's say another world,

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.170 align:middle line:84%
another dimension, or
another time period.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So it is a form of time travel
to travel through portals.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The structures we
saw, Gobekli Tepe, Stonehenge,

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.565 align:middle line:84%
and areas like that, maybe
even were the Great Pyramids

00:37:01.565 --> 00:37:05.970 align:middle line:84%
are in Giza, were they
put there systematically

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:84%
because of the
portals and people

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.970 align:middle line:90%
knew that they were there?

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I've learned
from some of my communication

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.690 align:middle line:90%
from outer body states.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And what they were saying
is that even civilizations

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.420 align:middle line:84%
like what we would
call the Atlanteans,

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.850 align:middle line:84%
they told me that
originally what

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.280 align:middle line:84%
we would call the
original Atlanteans

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.410 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth through a portal
that was located in the ocean.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And that
they were actually--

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.050 align:middle line:84%
came from a world
that was mostly water.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So their bodies had
more water density

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
than ours and they can
survive under water

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and that eventually
they came on to land.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you know that
the portals are there,

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:51.450 align:middle line:84%
how would you personally
use it to your advantage?

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Right
now, I would do it

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:55.910 align:middle line:90%
through the outer body states.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.406 align:middle line:90%
And you would actually find--

00:37:57.406 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Astral body.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.155 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Astral body.

00:37:59.155 --> 00:38:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And you would find
these portals today,

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:02.810 align:middle line:90%
and they're still active.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:05.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
go to Peru, they

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.130 align:middle line:90%
have many of these doorways.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At Nazca.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: At Nazca.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:13.610 align:middle line:90%
At Machu Picchu.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:16.040 align:middle line:10%
And these doorways
lead to nowhere.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.950 align:middle line:10%
It's just a stone wall
that has a door in it.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you would sit there and
meditate and leave your body,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:84%
that doorway is
an actual portal.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Opens up.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And you can
leave your body and travel

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.400 align:middle line:90%
through that gateway.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
with the pyramids.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.020 align:middle line:84%
There's different
subterranean chambers

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.910 align:middle line:84%
under the pyramids that
are resonant chambers,

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and what they would do is
they would sit and meditate

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:90%
in these chambers.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you would
leave your body,

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.625 align:middle line:84%
you would enter
into another world.

00:38:43.625 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
Christ had that ability

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.435 align:middle line:90%
to travel through these portals?

00:38:47.435 --> 00:38:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Absolutely.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Many masters throughout
time figured out

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.472 align:middle line:84%
a way to leave the body
to get that information.

00:38:55.472 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And they would
travel and have what

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.350 align:middle line:84%
we would call spiritual
experiences with other divine

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.310 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many humans are
aware of this in your opinion?

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say
there are tens of millions

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:15.576 align:middle line:84%
of people that leave their body
constantly, and they're aware.

00:39:15.576 --> 00:39:16.492 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On their own?

00:39:16.492 --> 00:39:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: On their own or
being guided from the outside.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that many people

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:84%
have connected the dots that
this is the reality we live in.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And at one time in our history,
this was completely normal.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:84%
This was a human
experience that everybody

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:39.020 align:middle line:84%
was able to go to
sleep, leave their body,

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and then travel to
be with the ancestors

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:46.670 align:middle line:84%
or to get information for
healing or to build technology.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.490 align:middle line:84%
This was the way that
it was done back then.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And now I think we're starting
to get back into that time

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:56.210 align:middle line:84%
period or that time loop where
we're starting to actually

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.910 align:middle line:84%
download and get this
information that this

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.730 align:middle line:84%
is the next step of
evolution, that this

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:04.669 align:middle line:84%
is the next place that
humankind is going.

00:40:04.669 --> 00:40:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, when you
go through these portals

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and you come back, what
has happened to you?

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Have you gained
physical strength?

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Are you more
psychically inclined?

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.160 align:middle line:90%
What happens to you?

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say that
for me personally it's

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.620 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a
spiritual journey.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So I come back with
more information

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.930 align:middle line:84%
about myself and the
universe that I live in.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's gaining a
more technical understanding

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:38.630 align:middle line:84%
of what I am, what we all are,
and how we're supposed to live.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So you get more
morals, more ethics,

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and you have a
different perception

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:84%
of how things work in the
world than your relationship

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.210 align:middle line:90%
to nature is.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it make
you a better person?

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It absolutely
makes you a better person.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does the person
watching this program right now

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.480 align:middle line:84%
tap into the same things
you've tapped into?

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, first
of all, we have

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to be aware that we're connected
to a source at all times.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:07.630 align:middle line:84%
We're receiving life
force energy at all times,

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.500 align:middle line:90%
and we're always connected.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
life force energy

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that these multi-dimensional
beings are tapped into as well.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the same life force energy
that the plants and the animals

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.470 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And we all use it to
evolve and progress

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.000 align:middle line:90%
our awareness of consciousness.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So by just tuning in to
that source or that stream

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.170 align:middle line:84%
of awareness, it
will slowly move us

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:34.700 align:middle line:84%
into that stream which gives
us information about ourselves.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And through that and through
that learning process,

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.550 align:middle line:90%
we start to heal.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we start
to become a better person,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:84%
because we will never
want to hurt anybody.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most of us don't.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Most of us don't
want to hurt people.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
about those people

00:41:49.378 --> 00:41:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that are just darn
right evil, Jason,

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:58.490 align:middle line:84%
that kill, maim, murder,
create wars, greed.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.090 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to them?

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:03.260 align:middle line:84%
They probably have no idea
what we're even talking about.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say
that through many years

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and through many traumas, they
have closed themselves off

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.839 align:middle line:84%
to this stream of awareness
in which I'm talking about.

00:42:12.839 --> 00:42:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or never had it.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Or never had it,
and to live a life when

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.700 align:middle line:84%
you feel you're alone
and not connected,

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.270 align:middle line:84%
it really desensitizes
you to basically be

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:90%
that person that's very evil.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So as you would
start to, let's say,

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.670 align:middle line:84%
practice something like
Qigong or a meditation

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.900 align:middle line:84%
or even get some spiritual
ethics and morals,

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:40.940 align:middle line:84%
we start to learn that
it's the disconnection that

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.190 align:middle line:84%
causes this type of
state of consciousness.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the disconnection
that causes

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.200 align:middle line:90%
addictions and obsessions.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
has a life force,

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and we are always
trying to live.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.770 align:middle line:90%
That's our goal, is survival.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So if we're not connected
to the life force energy,

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.800 align:middle line:84%
we need to find that
energy in other places.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.600 align:middle line:90%
So we could take it from people.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's
what being evil is.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.710 align:middle line:90%
We take it from others.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Energy
psychic vampires?

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Or we could take
it from things that

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:15.320 align:middle line:84%
exist like smoking
or alcohol or drugs,

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.970 align:middle line:84%
because that is a source
of energy as well.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So we can live off of
those energy fields,

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:23.490 align:middle line:90%
but it keeps us disconnected.

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If someone wants
to get into this area

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and perfect it for
themselves, any techniques?

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.350 align:middle line:84%
What I was told
almost immediately

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:37.210 align:middle line:84%
once I started to leave my
body was I had to heal myself.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I
had to heal myself

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.990 align:middle line:84%
was all about the
electromagnetic bodies that

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.600 align:middle line:84%
surround us, our
energetic fields.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was told I had to do a
healing practice called Qigong,

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.610 align:middle line:84%
which is to
reestablish and rebuild

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:55.880 align:middle line:84%
the energetic fields around
us and to reconnect ourselves

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to the natural flows of energy
in which we were discussing.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I was drawn to
was that native shamanism, so

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:11.690 align:middle line:84%
the traditional healing
wisdom that's been kept alive

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.390 align:middle line:90%
since thousands of years.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And they can see
beyond the world.

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.360 align:middle line:84%
They can see beyond
the third dimension.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.480 align:middle line:90%
So if you do have--

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.396 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have that
third eye, don't they.

00:44:21.396 --> 00:44:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yeah, so if you have
that spiritual attachment that

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.840 align:middle line:84%
is causing all this
chaos in your life,

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:84%
they would have the
know-how and the means

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.100 align:middle line:90%
to disconnect that from you.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ancient
civilizations, of course,

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.770 align:middle line:84%
which became the
foundation of all of this

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:39.710 align:middle line:84%
truly had an understanding
of what these portals were.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: In places like the
Cairo Museum in Egypt a number

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.690 align:middle line:84%
of artifacts have been found
from sites such as Saqqara,

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.046 align:middle line:84%
for example, that scientists
simply cannot explain.

00:44:52.046 --> 00:44:54.420 align:middle line:10%
They're reluctant to even put
them on view to the public.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.086 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are in
backrooms or they're

00:44:56.086 --> 00:44:57.827 align:middle line:10%
boxed up in the lower levels.

00:44:57.827 --> 00:44:59.910 align:middle line:10%
They're made of materials
that are not from Earth.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
this stuff is.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Could these
materials of un-Earthly origin

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.830 align:middle line:84%
be proof that these
gateways did exist?

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.572 align:middle line:90%


00:45:11.572 --> 00:45:13.780 align:middle line:10%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Anything
referred to as a gate of God

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.700 align:middle line:10%
or a navel of the
Earth is usually

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.210 align:middle line:10%
a sort of an energetic hot
spot, where the laws of physics

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:22.270 align:middle line:10%
are slightly
different or just so

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.250 align:middle line:10%
that allows you to
step through a portal

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:26.262 align:middle line:10%
into a level of existence.

00:45:26.262 --> 00:45:27.970 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN STONE: There
is one interpretation

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:30.100 align:middle line:10%
that would say perhaps
there was something

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.280 align:middle line:10%
going on connecting
different planets,

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.950 align:middle line:10%
different civilizations.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:40.620 align:middle line:10%
And remember the Sumerian
accounts are of jealous gods

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.392 align:middle line:10%
essentially, gods who are
vying for influence and power.

00:45:44.392 --> 00:45:45.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Could
mankind's ability

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:49.720 align:middle line:10%
to find these star gates be
the next chapter in forwarding

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.810 align:middle line:10%
our understanding of the
multi-dimensional universe

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:54.400 align:middle line:10%
we live in?

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we lose
something, Jason,

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients
had and possessed?

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: When I asked
the same question,

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:04.970 align:middle line:84%
the answer that I
would receive is,

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Jason you have to remember
in those times there

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.512 align:middle line:90%
was a different sun.

00:46:10.512 --> 00:46:11.720 align:middle line:90%
This is what they said to me.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.562 align:middle line:90%
There's a different sun.

00:46:13.562 --> 00:46:14.895 align:middle line:90%
And this has always bothered me.

00:46:14.895 --> 00:46:16.395 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they mean by that?

00:46:16.395 --> 00:46:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: What I believe is that
there is a different radiation,

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:23.260 align:middle line:84%
a different energy source
that was coming off the sun.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.414 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's changed?

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:26.205 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: That it's
changed in modern times.

00:46:26.205 --> 00:46:27.005 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:46:27.005 --> 00:46:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And I believe
the sun does go

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.120 align:middle line:90%
through these type of cycles.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And right now the
Earth's magnetic field

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:middle line:84%
is in a very
weakened state where

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times when
these sites existed,

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.840 align:middle line:84%
these portals into the
other worlds existed,

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:46.270 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic fields sometimes
in places like Jordan, Israel,

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, even in Antarctica,
the magnetic fields

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:84%
about 3,000 years ago sometimes
was 100 times stronger

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.660 align:middle line:84%
in these places
than it was today.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody must have
taught them this Jason?

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:04.270 align:middle line:84%
This is not something that
ancients would quickly know.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Who taught them?

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I believe that beings
that we would consider gods--

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: ETs?

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: ETs or just very
advanced humanoid beings

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.940 align:middle line:84%
would travel from their world
through the portal system

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:22.360 align:middle line:84%
to our world and either
seed different planets

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.920 align:middle line:84%
or they would come
and they would

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:29.911 align:middle line:84%
teach their knowledge so that
we could be at that level again.

00:47:29.911 --> 00:47:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
starting to happen now.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I think there are many people
waking up and receiving

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:39.010 align:middle line:84%
downloads of free energy
technology, how portals work,

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:42.167 align:middle line:84%
or even a person like
myself and others

00:47:42.167 --> 00:47:43.750 align:middle line:84%
who are taught how
to leave their body

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and travel these portal
systems to receive

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.490 align:middle line:90%
this type of information.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:49.570 align:middle line:90%
It's happening again.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
reach these portals

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:52.690 align:middle line:90%
through the dream state?

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.754 align:middle line:90%
Yes in fact--

00:47:54.754 --> 00:47:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might be
the easiest way.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: The dream state is
the best way of accessing it,

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and the dream
state is the first,

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I would say the first realm,
that you step into to access

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.190 align:middle line:84%
these higher dimensional
consciousness streams

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.630 align:middle line:90%
to travel.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, let's say
for example, a lucid dream.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.340 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in a lucid dream
and I realize I'm dreaming,

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.360 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it'll just snap me
right into the outer body state

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:84%
where I'll just
stop dreaming and--

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.189 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you will
be ascending already.

00:48:26.189 --> 00:48:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I'll be
ascending right when

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.780 align:middle line:90%
I figure out I'm conscious.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I figure out I'm
conscious in that state,

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.870 align:middle line:84%
then the beings will
be there to assist you.

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:37.600 align:middle line:84%
The portals will
open and it's almost

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.575 align:middle line:84%
like it's a predetermined place
that they're going to take you

00:48:41.575 --> 00:48:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people have
had after-death experiences

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.315 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about a portal
and they talk about a tunnel

00:48:49.315 --> 00:48:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about
a light, are they

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:55.050 align:middle line:84%
going through these
portals when they die?

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: I believe so.

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
figure this out, too,

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and I still don't
have all the answers.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think the human being is
not just a body, and a spirit,

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:07.890 align:middle line:90%
and a soul.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are a
multi-dimensional being that

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.330 align:middle line:84%
have many different bodies
that we're not aware of.

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment of death,
the physical body dies,

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:22.590 align:middle line:84%
but there are many bodies
that still live on after.

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient times,
especially in Egypt,

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.290 align:middle line:84%
they would talk
about the Ba, which

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:31.490 align:middle line:84%
is it's kind of like your
astral body or spirit,

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and they would depict it
as a human head on a bird,

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and they would show it above
the deceased person's body.

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:42.570 align:middle line:10%
And they made it very clear that
the Ba could leave your body

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:45.930 align:middle line:10%
at night any time and
that it could travel

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.610 align:middle line:10%
through different portals.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:50.400 align:middle line:84%
It's also eternal,
but it's also you.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.010 align:middle line:84%
It maintains your identity
and your personality.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.220 align:middle line:90%
So when I leave my body, I'm me.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jason with my level of
consciousness and awareness.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's that
Ba, that astral body,

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that people are describing
as the spirit when they die.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So when the physical
body dies, suddenly

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.040 align:middle line:84%
their identity
and personality is

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.160 align:middle line:84%
outside their body in
this Ba, or astral body

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.970 align:middle line:84%
state, which gives them
access to these portals.

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you die, the
most common description

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.340 align:middle line:84%
is that angels or
beings or family members

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:31.050 align:middle line:84%
are right there to greet you and
assist you into that next place

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:32.760 align:middle line:84%
through these different
portal systems.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell us about your
book, "Forbidden Knowledge."

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.360 align:middle line:10%
>>QUITT: "Forbidden
Knowledge," it's

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.490 align:middle line:10%
called Revelations of a
Multi-dimensional Time

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:39.530 align:middle line:10%
Traveler.

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And it basically goes through
my personal experiences

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:45.042 align:middle line:90%
throughout my whole life of--

00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many of the things
we've talked about today.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, and rediscovering
that what I go through

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.740 align:middle line:84%
is actually part of the
human experience that

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.380 align:middle line:84%
has been shut down
for thousands of years

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:02.310 align:middle line:84%
through many different
belief systems and religions

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:03.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're not
supposed to go there.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.839 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to know this stuff.

00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we called
the book Forbidden Knowledge,

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:15.280 align:middle line:84%
because you know even just 50
years ago or even 20 years ago,

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:19.230 align:middle line:84%
it's very taboo to talk
about these topics,

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:21.067 align:middle line:84%
to talk about outer
body experiences.

00:51:21.067 --> 00:51:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: To talk about
ghosts and aliens and all

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:25.890 align:middle line:90%
these topics.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's part
of the same phenomenon.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It's all part of this
multi-dimensional existence

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're all a part of,
and we're all connected to

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and that we're just
finally starting

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to rediscover that we are
connected to all of this

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:90%
and we all have access to it.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
anything that scares you

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:48.720 align:middle line:84%
or about what you've learned
that you think, oh my gosh,

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.730 align:middle line:90%
what have I stumbled into here?

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: What scares
me the most is the fact

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:56.065 align:middle line:84%
that I realize that we
are responsible for all

00:51:56.065 --> 00:51:56.865 align:middle line:90%
of our actions.

00:51:56.865 --> 00:51:59.630 align:middle line:90%


00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
we do in this world

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:10.190 align:middle line:84%
has consequences and that what
records our life is our heart.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Our heart is an
individual being,

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and it will record
our entire life.

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So that when we pass,
it's that recording

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that decides what
we're going to do next.

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is hell to you?

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: What is hell is a
place of unconsciousness.

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:30.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's to me.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that when
we go through our healing

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.810 align:middle line:84%
process, what we're
doing is we're

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:41.020 align:middle line:84%
processing all the heavy
energies that we've

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:45.430 align:middle line:84%
been connecting with
for many lifetimes.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So a shaman, for
example, will go and heal

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.250 align:middle line:90%
and it will be like hell.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're being
dismembered and being put back

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:57.850 align:middle line:84%
together again so they can
have a new body and a new life.

00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I believe hell
is, is living with the things

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:04.650 align:middle line:84%
that we carry that
we want to hide from.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's through the
process of letting go

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and healing and processing
that energy that we

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:12.460 align:middle line:84%
receive these new bodies
and this new awareness.

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is heaven?

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say heaven
is a state of awareness,

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:21.310 align:middle line:90%
that you are eternal.

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:23.500 align:middle line:84%
You're multi-dimensional,
and you

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.930 align:middle line:84%
have the choice
and the sovereignty

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:30.250 align:middle line:84%
to do what you want to do
for your next incarnation.

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:34.360 align:middle line:84%
If you even want to
come back and incarnate.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Most people, who
have become a little more

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:42.220 align:middle line:84%
aware of consciousness
and psychic abilities

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and just aspects of
life that they normally

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.510 align:middle line:84%
would not have done have become,
I think, enlightened people.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:51.510 align:middle line:90%
They're better people.

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:53.670 align:middle line:90%
They're happier people.

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:56.430 align:middle line:84%
They care about other
people more and more.

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:58.770 align:middle line:84%
How do we get this
planet, Jason,

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:03.480 align:middle line:84%
to start thinking that way
as opposed to the horror

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:07.830 align:middle line:90%
that we all witness every day.

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:10.260 align:middle line:84%
How can we have more
Jason Quitts, for example.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Well, we're
actually doing it right now.

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Just having this
conversation openly

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.470 align:middle line:84%
is the most amazing thing,
because if I could do this,

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:21.640 align:middle line:90%
it means you can do this.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.620 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
human experience.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to be open
and honest about how we live

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.950 align:middle line:90%
and what we're experiencing.

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And through this,
it's going to awaken

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.580 align:middle line:84%
so many other people, where
you won't be able to stop it.

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.119 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to be a
normal, human experience.

00:54:38.119 --> 00:54:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
would you recommend

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:44.940 align:middle line:84%
to people who are just
starting to get into this,

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:47.020 align:middle line:90%
but they're not quite there yet.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say the
first level of the awakening

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:53.670 align:middle line:90%
process is fear and negativity.

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:57.780 align:middle line:84%
We go through this
huge phase where

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.490 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
conspiracy, when

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:02.360 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at the
world like why am I here,

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.647 align:middle line:90%
the world is so evil.

00:55:03.647 --> 00:55:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With doubt.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Right.

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So we really look at the
world with different eyes.

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go
through that fear.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:15.119 align:middle line:84%
We have to go through
that state first,

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and we have to walk through
it and come out of it

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.950 align:middle line:84%
to say you know
what, I understand

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:23.370 align:middle line:84%
that our consciousness and what
we believe and what we think

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and what we do actually
makes a difference.

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And that if we start to change
the way we see the world,

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.400 align:middle line:84%
the world will start
to change around us.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there anything
magical about this,

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.360 align:middle line:90%
or is it normal and natural?

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: We call it magic, but
it's actually the normal state.

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:45.000 align:middle line:84%
If all of us started
to think and perceive

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.330 align:middle line:84%
the world in this
way, that's the way

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:52.820 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is going
to evolve into.

00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When someone
sees a homeless person

00:55:55.650 --> 00:56:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and you give them money, does
that open up portals for us

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.170 align:middle line:90%
personally, when you do good?

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: I think so.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.860 align:middle line:90%
And it has to do with resonance.

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:08.660 align:middle line:90%
So, for example,

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.459 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Karma?

00:56:09.459 --> 00:56:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Karma.

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:13.680 align:middle line:10%
Yes we can call resonance karma
too, because it's pulling us.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.280 align:middle line:10%
So if we want, or
it's not a want.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.190 align:middle line:84%
If we are living
a good life, we're

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:23.070 align:middle line:90%
attracting good things to us.

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So many times when people will
have a spiritual experience,

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:29.940 align:middle line:84%
for example, or a
being will come to them

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.370 align:middle line:84%
that's a very positive
being, the being

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:33.840 align:middle line:84%
is coming to them
because they're

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.720 align:middle line:84%
attracted to the energy
field that they're carrying

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.040 align:middle line:90%
because they are doing good.

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you are a person that sees
the world in a very negative

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.810 align:middle line:84%
light, they're going to attract
different beings to them that

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:47.970 align:middle line:84%
also see the world
in a negative light,

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:49.590 align:middle line:90%
and we can call those demons.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:52.620 align:middle line:84%
The mind is a very
powerful thing,

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and energy follows the
direction of your mind.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
important universal law.

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you put your mind
to negative places,

00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:05.070 align:middle line:84%
you are giving your life force
to those negative things.

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the power of the
brain, Jason, that does this?

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something out there
that gets this done for us?

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say it's
the power of resonance.

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think a certain
way and you feel a certain way,

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:25.170 align:middle line:84%
you're sending out a frequency
through this multi-dimensional

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:27.040 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And that frequency
will immediately

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:33.810 align:middle line:84%
connect to others that
have that same frequency,

00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:35.740 align:middle line:90%
and you'll pull that to you.

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you're on the
right path, if you

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:39.900 align:middle line:84%
have that right
state of mind, it's

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.900 align:middle line:84%
almost like the
universe will conspire

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to get you to the next place
that you need to go to.

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So the right people will
just come into your life

00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:54.390 align:middle line:84%
at the right time and will
open up a new life for you.

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe that with
that type of positive thought

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and by setting up your
energy in the right way,

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:04.620 align:middle line:84%
suddenly the universe
or source or whatever

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:08.610 align:middle line:84%
you want to call it, is now
pulling you in that direction.

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One day, I
believe, the planet

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.500 align:middle line:84%
will awaken and start
thinking this way.

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I think
they're starting.

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And once this is out of
the bag, and once people

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:24.410 align:middle line:84%
start to really
see it as reality,

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:26.912 align:middle line:84%
this world is going
to change very fast.

00:58:26.912 --> 00:58:29.120 align:middle line:84%
For people who want your
book, "Forbidden Knowledge,"

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.170 align:middle line:90%
available where?

00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It's available on Amazon.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Or they can go to my web site.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is?

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:39.240 align:middle line:10%
>>QUITT: Thecrystalsun.com
and that's thecrystalsun.com.

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good enough.

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:42.920 align:middle line:10%
Jason, thanks for
being on the program.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.336 align:middle line:84%
You're an enlightened
human being.

00:58:44.336 --> 00:58:45.530 align:middle line:90%
I can tell.

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Thank you for
having me, Georage.

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's got
a glow about him.

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you can see it
on television, but it's here.

00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that special glow
is what has changed his life,

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.040 align:middle line:90%
and it can change yours, too.

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and
this is Beyond Belief.
