00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:10%
You know, there is one
subject that captures

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:10%
the imagination of everybody.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.820 align:middle line:90%
And that is cryptids, creatures.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've got an expert, the
world-renowned Loren Coleman.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.340 align:middle line:90%
He's a cryptozoologist.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And he studies these
strange creatures.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Loren, welcome to the program.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LOREN COLEMAN: George, it's
great being here with you.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got
to tell you, when

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:84%
you were on "Coast to Coast"
with me on the radio show,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and as often as you've been
on, I get so much response

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
after you're on
from people who just

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
love these stories of
Bigfoot, and Mothman, and all

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.300 align:middle line:90%
these other creatures.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: I do too-- a lot of
emails, a lot of communication.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:10%
They listen, and they want more.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Was there one case a long
time ago that just got

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.861 align:middle line:90%
you interested in this?

00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: It actually
happened through a movie.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
In 1960, I saw a movie called
"Half Human," a Japanese film.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I went to school the
next day and said,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:84%
what is this about
yetis in the Himalayas?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And three teachers
said three different things.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:84%
They don't exist, get back to
your studies, leave me alone.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
want to hear it.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: No, they didn't
want to hear about it.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:90%
But I did.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I started reading and
started investigating cases,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:90%
doing all kinds of field work.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm much like you.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I was 10 years old when
that movie came out.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But I was obsessed with
"The Abominable Snowman."

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And I think that
creature was whitish, right?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:90%
He had a lot of white hair.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.525 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, that's
one of the myths.

00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
The actual native peoples
always described them as black

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:90%
to reddish brown.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But because of one
movie, most Americans

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:90%
think that the yetis are white.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
That movie is "Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:84%
because abominables
were always white.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you're
into cryptozoology--

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.653 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --which means you
must be an expert on Bitcoins

00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:90%
and things-- no, I'm kidding.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: People confuse that.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people
confusing that nowadays?

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, yes, yes.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It's really routine.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I go online, go on social media.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Just because I'm
Crypto Loren doesn't

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:84%
mean that I'm into crypto
bits and crypto coins.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly what
is cryptozoology?

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Cryptozoology
is the study

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:90%
of hidden or unknown animals.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:10%
We look for the evidence to
actually verify and confirm

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:10%
new species, like the giant
panda, the mountain gorilla,

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:10%
the giant squid.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:10%
Those used to be cryptids.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
They used to be
unknown creatures.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
discovered, and they

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:90%
become part of zoology.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So the whole goal
of cryptozoology

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
is to be out there, to
talk to native people,

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:84%
to look for physical
evidence, and to really do

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.239 align:middle line:84%
a better job of really
describing what's in nature.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're out there.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
What's so-- this
planet is so immense.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.624 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We would
think, you know,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
we're naive to think that we
know every creature that's

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:90%
out here.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:84%
There must be so many that
we haven't even discovered.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.304 align:middle line:90%
It's endless.

00:03:29.304 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Absolutely.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's new
discoveries every day.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
They found a new
songbird in Central Park.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
They found a new turtle
down in Mississippi.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's the little
ones in America

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:90%
that people forget about.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: There
was a new tapir,

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:84%
which is the creature
with a little snout,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:84%
discovered in Brazil
just three years ago--

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.917 align:middle line:84%
new animals, new
apes all the time.

00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We use the
phrase "cryptids" a lot.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: "Cryptids"
is just a word

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
to describe the animals that
cryptozoology is looking for.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A-ha.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: But it also
has the connotation

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:90%
that they're unknown.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if I get
a sighting from a lake,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and somebody sees an
object in that lake,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
it's a cryptid until
we can figure out,

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:90%
is that an alligator?

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:90%
Is it an unknown creature?

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it just a wave and a mistake?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So they're cryptids,
really describes

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.457 align:middle line:90%
the unknown part of it.

00:04:25.457 --> 00:04:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Loch Ness Monster--

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:84%
would it still be
considered a cryptid--

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Oh,
yeah, until it's--

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --at this point,
until it's identified?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Absolutely, because
it's not been identified.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
conclusively been proven

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
to be a hoax, even
though a lot of people

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:84%
come forward every
two years saying

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.562 align:middle line:84%
they know the answer for
the Loch Ness Monster.

00:04:44.562 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that brings
up another question,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
too, because so many people
see so many different things.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing something,
whether it's Bigfoot,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:90%
the Loch Ness Monster, Mothman.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into Mothman.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
You've got a new
book out on that.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:90%
What are they seeing?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.086 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, even within
any category of cryptid,

00:05:06.086 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:84%
you have people seeing
multiple experiences.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you can say
you saw the Loch Ness Monster.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But it could be
something with humps.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
It could just be a large body
on the surface of the water.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be waves.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So even within any
category, there's

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:90%
different manifestations.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But all across
cryptozoology, there

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.030 align:middle line:84%
is literally hundreds
of different cryptids,

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:84%
different expeditions out there,
different studies going on,

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
different people
writing different books.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.789 align:middle line:84%
So there's a vast
universe in cryptozoology.

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing field.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And there's a cryptozoologist.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.330 align:middle line:84%
His name is Taylor
James Johnson.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he talks
about your field.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's an inherent
psychological condition whereby

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
humans really crave and
desire a little bit of mystery

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, a little
bit of intrigue.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.332 align:middle line:10%
I think, deep down, that we
like to think that perhaps there

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:10%
are things out there that we
don't quite understand, things

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.406 align:middle line:10%
that go bump in the dark.

00:06:10.406 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:10%
And it brings a sense of
adventure to our lives.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:10%
A lot of cryptozoologists,
you know, it's a very--

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.603 align:middle line:10%
there's kind of an emotional
attachment to the subject

00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:23.640 align:middle line:10%
matter, because when
you're talking about things

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:10%
like Bigfoot, things like we're
out here investigating now

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:10%
that have almost a
legendary tinge to them,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:10%
it strikes on a nerve
that we have as humans.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.790 align:middle line:10%
But from a scientific
point of view,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.248 align:middle line:10%
I think that you
actually have to--

00:06:38.248 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:10%
you have to be willing
to debunk and reject

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:10%
things that don't fit into
the accepted theory or into,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.395 align:middle line:10%
you know, common sense.

00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it, Loren?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.012 align:middle line:84%
What is it that drives people
to look for these creatures?

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: I really
think that it's

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:90%
a combination of two things.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:84%
People are always
interested in mysteries.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And a great majority of humans
are interested in animals.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
combination, put together

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
with this enormous
curious passion.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:84%
You want to discover
what's going on.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:90%
You want to find the cryptids.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:84%
You want to know the
answer to your questions.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And so there's-- when
I started this in 1960,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.562 align:middle line:84%
Ivan Sanderson and I
would talk about it.

00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:25.362 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And there were
a handful of people--

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:90%
five, six.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands
around the world,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.215 align:middle line:84%
now, interested
in cryptozoology.

00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would
think, though,

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:84%
with thousands of
people investigating,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
that we would find these
creatures once and for all.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: We do.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.710 align:middle line:90%
We find them all the time.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the celebrity
cryptids, as I call them--

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
you know, Bigfoot, Yeti, Loch
Ness Monster, and the sea

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:90%
serpents, aren't found.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
kind of on a shelf.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:84%
For instance, can
you imagine what

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:84%
science feels about a
creature called Bigfoot?

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: So we're already up
against the wall with the name.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
Bigfoot for a second.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Sure.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have taught
us of a creature called

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Gigantus pithecus, right?

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which is
an apelike animal

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:10%
down in the Florida region.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:90%
People are seeing a creature.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt in my mind.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing something
that looks apelike.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
morons running around

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
in apelike costumes all
the time, because they're

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:90%
going to get shot at.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, especially
in the South, yes.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.496 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or something's
going to happen.

00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:90%
so folks are looking at this.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.780 align:middle line:84%
But why can't we
get one of them?

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And I don't necessarily
say, let's shoot it

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:90%
and capture it that way.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.924 align:middle line:84%
But why can't we find one and
say, here you go world, look?

00:08:46.924 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, I think
they're very elusive.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:90%
They're very intelligent.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think of all
of the apes or the primates,

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:84%
the one that's closest to
the intelligence of humans

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:90%
has to be Bigfoot.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Grover Krantz
and I once talked about,

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
statistically, for
every 10,000 black bear,

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.400 align:middle line:90%
there's one Bigfoot.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember that
case of the Atlanta bomber--

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --he hid in the woods
of North Carolina for three

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And here, you had the whole
United States government

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.390 align:middle line:90%
looking for this one man.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
couldn't find him.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: They
couldn't find him.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:90%
How was he finally found?

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:90%
He was raiding a garbage dump.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And that,
I think, is how

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
you're going to find Bigfoot.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:84%
A lumber truck is going
to hit one on a road.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
One is going to be near
some kind of area of eating

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and will get shot.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's no concerted effort
right now-- there's no money,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.000 align:middle line:84%
there's no museums,
there's no zoos looking

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:84%
for these animals the way they
were during the Victorian Age.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.540 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of haphazard.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a good way
to look for a new animal.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do most people
describe Bigfoot, Loren,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:90%
in terms of its appearance?

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well,
in general, Bigfoot

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:90%
is 6 and 1/2 to 8 feet tall.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
That's for the adult. The colors
are black to reddish brown.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:10%
There's hair all
over their bodies.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, they're
talked about as having

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:10%
a slightly pointed head,
and some vocalizations that

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:10%
seem to be a primitive
form of communication.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.310 align:middle line:84%
They have footprints that
are like our human footprint,

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:90%
but 18 to 20 inches long.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.080 align:middle line:84%
The Yeti, for instance,
has a footprint

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:90%
that's more like our hand is--

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.989 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: --more like an ape.

00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where you
have the distinction.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.430 align:middle line:84%
In Florida, you
have the skunk ape.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, all across the
South, the lower South,

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
you have the Booger, the
Honey Island Swamp Monster.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Those are all
apelike anthropoids

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.974 align:middle line:84%
that have feet that look like
this, that look like your hand.

00:10:58.974 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are
people describing

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:90%
the face of this thing?

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: A lot of people
think that they're humanlike,

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:90%
but they're really not.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
There's more hair all
over the face of Bigfoot.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Their nose is much flatter.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.814 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have the hood
to it like humans do.

00:11:15.814 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it more apelike?

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Much more apelike.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.000 align:middle line:84%
There's actually some
considered opinion

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.760 align:middle line:84%
that if you look at some
of the old drawings,

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
their face comes
forward much more

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.417 align:middle line:90%
like a chimpanzee or a gorilla.

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course,
there's been some attempts

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.315 align:middle line:84%
to get DNA samples
of these creatures.

00:11:35.315 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:10%
>> All right, back to that
story that had a lot of people

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:10%
talking in the newsroom
today of the video,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:10%
purportedly of Bigfoot,
new video there.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Melba Ketchum is a believer.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:10%
She's also the director of
the Sasquatch DNA Project.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:10%
She's our guest this afternoon.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure that you get a
lot of people who say, come on.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:11:54.685 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>> What's this done to you?

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:84%
You said it's been actually
kind of hard on you.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, it's been rather painful.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:10%
I was naive when
I went into this.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:10%
I thought science would
welcome new information

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:10%
if it was available.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:10%
I didn't believe it.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:10%
I didn't think they existed
when I started this.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.788 align:middle line:10%
>> But you do believe it now?

00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yes, have to believe it.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:10%
Not only does the
DNA data prove it,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:10%
but I've actually seen them
at this point, brought--

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:10%
some of the people that were at
our news conference invited me.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:10%
And I actually
have seen them now.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, the DNA here that
we're talking about--

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:10%
how is it found?

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:10%
How is it extracted?

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.780 align:middle line:10%
>> There were a bunch of groups
that were out to look and find

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:10%
the DNA, especially the Erickson
project with Adrian Erickson.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:10%
They actually had a PhD
on staff and a manager.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:10%
They spent untold
amount of money

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:10%
to not only
accomplish the video,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:10%
but to collect forensically
sound DNA samples.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:10%
And my basis is in forensics.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.405 align:middle line:10%
So the chain of
custody was intact.

00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, now, the "Houston
Chronicle" tested this, though.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:10%
And they sort of
questioned your findings.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:10%
>> No, the "Houston
Chronicle" did not test it.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:10%
The lab that they wanted us
to share with did not test it.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to look
at some of the genome.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.913 align:middle line:10%
They didn't even get
the whole genome.

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:10%
They did a very cursory thing.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.276 align:middle line:10%
I absolutely--
they wouldn't even

00:13:04.276 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:10%
talk to me on the
phone about it.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Hm.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, people will look at
the video and the pictures

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:10%
that we have.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:10%
And it seems like it's
always grainy, or strange,

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.330 align:middle line:10%
or what have you.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:10%
How come it's never clear
if this is out there?

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:10%
>> They are a type of people.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:10%
They're a human
hybrid, we believe.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:10%
And all the DNA
evidence points to that.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:10%
And they can elude us.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, if
you get it at all,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be
very fleeting, and--

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.680 align:middle line:10%
though Adrian Erickson
has absolutely gotten

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:10%
some beautiful video,
especially a full facial shot,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.380 align:middle line:10%
where she turns and
actually looks at you.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Who funds this?

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:10%
How do you get the money
to go forward with this?

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:10%
Because there are so many
people out there that just--

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:10%
they don't believe in this.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, actually, the
majority of the money came from

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:10%
an entrepreneur, Wally Hersom,
out of Henderson, Nevada.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:10%
And the other portion
came from Adrian Erickson.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:10%
They're both entrepreneurs.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:10%
And they're interested
in the subject matter

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:10%
and were willing to fund the
study, because they wanted

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:10%
to prove that it exists--

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:10%
existed and does exist.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:10%
And we just happened to be
the lab that ended up with it.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:10%
>> And yet, there are a lot
of people out there who still

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:10%
don't believe.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:10%
So the work's not done yet.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they're not
going to believe it.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people are not going to
believe it till we have a body.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.330 align:middle line:10%
But we don't--
we're not pro-kill.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:10%
They're a type of person.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:10%
That's murder.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-huh.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:10%
>> So you cannot kill them.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, interesting topic.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for joining
us this afternoon.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take, Loren.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:90%
What about the DNA?

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well,
for one thing, one

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons that people
respect me in this field

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm open
minded, but skeptical.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Her results
have really been disputed.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on the side
of the dispute.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.065 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a bear or
something like that, samples?

00:14:42.065 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, her
conclusions that the Bigfoot

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:84%
DNA that she found is part
angel and part Neanderthal just

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:90%
doesn't go.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Bryan Sykes, who did
the follow-up study,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:90%
really did a good job.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what Bigfoot is.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:90%
But DNA is the future.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:84%
We need to catch Bigfoot
through the DNA first.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I agree with her.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't be killing them.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: I'm in
the no-kill camp.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.197 align:middle line:84%
I hate it when people
call the show and say,

00:15:16.197 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go out
and shoot Bigfoot.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.696 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Absolutely.

00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:19.934 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, no, no, no, no.

00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Absolutely.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd rather it escape--

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --before you kill it.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Her work actually
destroyed about 130 samples

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that, if we would have
tested them more correctly,

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
we might have had
some good, sound--

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And so
a lot of people

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:90%
do not like what she did.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But there's-- that's
part of Bigfoot--

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, Bigfoot studies,
is that there's conflict

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.440 align:middle line:90%
between different divisions.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And the people in
it are sometimes

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:84%
as interesting to
study as the creatures.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Loren, in the
very grainy film we just

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
looked at, you can tell there's
an object out there somewhere.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
really don't know.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
It could be a man
just walking around.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.276 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows, right?

00:16:03.276 --> 00:16:04.076 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:16:04.076 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the downsides
of all of the cell phones

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and all of the videotaping
that has occurred

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
is, it's actually
lowered the quality.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: In 1967, whenever
the Patterson-Gimlin film was

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
taken, that was done
with a real camera.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
enhance it with a computer.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Those film analyses really
is the gold standard.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.147 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of
video is really junk--

00:16:34.147 --> 00:16:34.947 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:34.947 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --garbage
in, garbage out.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing a lot
of that on YouTube.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can't really
decipher what we just saw.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
all you could see

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:84%
is something in the
background somewhere.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
It is-- the whole jokes
about, all of them are blurry,

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.937 align:middle line:90%
happens to be true.

00:16:48.937 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is true.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is true.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.818 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
we'll ever find out

00:16:52.818 --> 00:16:56.254 align:middle line:84%
exactly what's going on with
a creature like Bigfoot?

00:16:56.254 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: I think so.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
lack patience nowadays.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the Twitter,
MTV generation, where people

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:84%
want the results
instantaneous, yet we

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
know that it took 70-some years
to discover the giant panda,

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:90%
the mountain gorilla.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And those were
concerted efforts.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.750 align:middle line:84%
You have, what's going on now,
a lot of this quickness to it.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:90%
But we have to be patient.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:90%
It's like building the pyramids.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.719 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen overnight.

00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
still getting stories

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:84%
of the Abominable
Snowman in the Himalayas?

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard
anything in a long time.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: They're
not as frequent.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
There is a body of people
that think the yetis have all

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:90%
gone extinct.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:90%
And maybe, maybe so.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
What we do know is going on is
that some of the DNA analysis

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:84%
is showing that there's
bears involved in a higher

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
number than what people
were thinking about

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:84%
in the '20s and the
'50s, that there are

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
some kind of new
bears over there

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
that may be an answer
to some of the yetis.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And actually, a
lot of the people

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
talked about three kinds
of yetis, a smaller one,

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:84%
the Meh-Teh, the manlike
one, and the Denzo-Teh,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:90%
which was taller.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And that may be a giant
unknown bear, which

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:90%
would be just as exciting.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would be exciting.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure would be.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:84%
You've established a crypto
museum in Portland, Maine.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the museum.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, in 2003, I
decided I had so many things

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%
from almost 60 years of
collecting that I founded

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:84%
the International
Cryptozoology Museum at--

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:84%
now it's at Thompson's
Point, Portland, Maine.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
It has 10,000 artifacts
from all over the world--

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:90%
yeti material.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It has Sir Edmund
Hillary's hair samples--

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --Tom Slick hair
samples from '59 and '60.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classics.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
model of a Bigfoot

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:84%
that's eight foot tall
that's the Crookston

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot from Minnesota.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And those kinds of things
went into the museum.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And we've slowly,
over the years, we're

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:90%
now an established site.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
We actually, two years
ago, built a museum

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.100 align:middle line:84%
from the ground up,
two stories tall.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:90%
It's in--

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Public can go?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, yeah, definitely.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anybody can go?

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: It's
open to the public.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a 501(c)(3).

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a nonprofit.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the only
nonprofit cryptozoology

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:90%
museum in the world.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely became, if I
will build it, they will come.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It's just been--

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: so
fantastically popular.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of those
who came was CBS News.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> These are actual
casts of Bigfoot.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> (VOICEOVER) Loren Coleman
thinks the whole field

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:84%
of cryptozoology
deserves more respect.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people would like to
put it in some kind of category

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.770 align:middle line:90%
of pseudoscience.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:90%
And we really reject that.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.032 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call
our little Bigfoot.

00:19:55.032 --> 00:19:55.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:19:55.832 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> (VOICEOVER) He founded the

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:90%
museum in Portland, Maine.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Its logo is a strange-looking
fish called a coelacanth.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:84%
It was thought to be
extinct for 65 million years

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:90%
until one was found in 1938.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:14.960 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a living fossil.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:10%
And actually, the
word "living fossil"

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:10%
is first associated
with this fish.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> (VOICEOVER) True that Western
science has been wrong before.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Coleman points to
the giant squid.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Once dismissed as a mythological
creature called the kraken,

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm told they started washing
up onshore in the 1800s.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.490 align:middle line:84%
The giant panda was believed
to be some weird mutation

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
until Ruth Harkness
went to China

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and brought one
back alive in 1936.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.372 align:middle line:90%
>> The fur-bearing trout.

00:20:46.372 --> 00:20:47.171 align:middle line:90%
Some people--

00:20:47.171 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> This is fake.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>> This is definitely fake.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> (VOICEOVER) And though
there are plenty of hoaxes out

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course, the jackalope.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.011 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the jackalope.

00:20:55.011 --> 00:20:56.875 align:middle line:84%
>> And above it is
the wolpertinger--

00:20:56.875 --> 00:20:57.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Aw.

00:20:57.675 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:84%

>>NOORY: What a cool museum.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I got to get up there.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, thank you.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:90%
That's-- it's really been fun.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.722 align:middle line:84%
And I meet people from
all over the world.

00:21:13.722 --> 00:21:14.555 align:middle line:90%
It's just fantastic.

00:21:14.555 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
crowds do you get there?

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, we get
about 15,000 a year or so.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
On Saturdays and Sundays,
it can be totally filled.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And we get people
from Japan, and Spain,

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.989 align:middle line:90%
and even from Colorado.

00:21:27.989 --> 00:21:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that's great.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.656 align:middle line:84%
What fascinates
people the most when

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:90%
they go through the museum?

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, there
are personal favorites.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Some people like the mermaid.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Some people like the Bigfoot,
the Loch Ness Monster.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But you have all
kinds of favorites

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:90%
according to your own interest.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Chupacabras, for instance--

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --really
fascinate people.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That fish
was interesting.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, the coelacanth.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It had little
bitey teeth, too, didn't it?

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: The coelacanth is
actually closer related to you

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:10%
than it is to bony
fish, because it is--

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're saying I look
like one of those fish, Loren?

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.276 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: No, no, no.

00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:90%
You're a human.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.960 align:middle line:84%
It's more closely related
to humans than regular fish,

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:90%
because they're very ancient.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:09.695 align:middle line:90%
They're like lungfish.

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it still around--

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, yes.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --or is it extinct?

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: 1938, they
found the first one,

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:90%
as far as Western science.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:90%
The locals had been eating them.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:90%
They thought it tasted awful.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So they put a lot
of spices on it.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:90%
They call it Gombessa.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:90%
They have now found about 250.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And most of them
are in museums now,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
because they're such a rare,
important fish in terms

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:84%
of cryptozoology and zoology
that they don't eat them

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't kill them
and cut them up.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.750 align:middle line:90%
They preserve them.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big
are they, like that?

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: No.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:90%
It's 5 and 1/2 to 6 feet long.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:90%
They're gigantic.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.464 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a big fish.

00:22:51.464 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, very big.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what about colors?

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, the funny
thing is, in 1998, they

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
discovered a whole new species
off of Indonesia that's

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:90%
more brown.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.809 align:middle line:84%
But that original color of
the ones from the '30s--

00:23:09.809 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looked a little
bluish, didn't it?

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Very
blue, metallic blue.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunate thing
is, when they die,

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and they often-- they're
a deep, deep sea fish.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
They come to the surface,
swim around, and die.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.430 align:middle line:90%
They turn brown.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people think
that they're brown,

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.760 align:middle line:84%
because actually, they're
on stamps nowadays.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And most of the stamps,
they show them as blue.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:84%
But there was one country
that made the mistake

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:90%
and showed them as brown.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:35.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:23:35.895 --> 00:23:36.739 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:23:36.739 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how does
science find these creatures?

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.655 align:middle line:84%
They stumble into
them, I guess, right?

00:23:40.655 --> 00:23:41.455 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:23:41.455 --> 00:23:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, that one, for
instance, in South Africa,

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:90%
there's a little museum.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And a woman who was
the director would

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.990 align:middle line:84%
go down to the shore,
the dock every day,

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and see people that would
dump their fish hauls.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And right in the middle of
one of these piles of fish

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.430 align:middle line:90%
was a coelacanth.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.026 align:middle line:90%
And it was bright blue--

00:24:01.026 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A smaller
one, no doubt.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: No, no, it
was the actual first one.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.024 align:middle line:84%
We have the replica
of the first one--

00:24:06.024 --> 00:24:06.823 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:06.823 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --5
and 1/2 feet long.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.260 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I didn't--

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:90%
I walked down there.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So I had to put it
in the back of a taxi

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:90%
to get back to the museum.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And so she didn't
make a taxi driver very happy.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:90%
But she discovered it.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.830 align:middle line:84%
She found out that it was a
fish from 65 million years

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:90%
ago that nobody had seen.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, it
was very exciting.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:84%
What other exciting
things are out there,

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:84%
do you think, as
a cryptozoologist?

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.240 align:middle line:84%
What would just
knock your socks off?

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: I think
that we're very

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:84%
close to finding some
of the things that

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.687 align:middle line:90%
are being called sea serpents.

00:24:43.687 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:90%
I think there's probably--

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A-ha.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --a long, maybe not
60, 100 feet long, but 20 feet,

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:54.585 align:middle line:84%
40 feet long, that may
be an ancient whale,

00:24:54.585 --> 00:24:56.370 align:middle line:90%
a prehistoric whale.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:84%
We're finding new
dolphins all the time.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: So it's
quite exciting to think,

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
there could be a new fish
that's not a fish but actually

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.090 align:middle line:84%
a mammal, because people are
making a mistake all the time.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Sea serpents, and loch monsters,
and lake monsters actually

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:90%
go through the water like this.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be
a big eel, right?

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, what
we know is, the fish

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and reptiles go through
the water like this.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And so
what is unknown is

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.670 align:middle line:90%
some kind of large mammal.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So the whole misnomer
of saying "sea serpent,"

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:90%
they're not reptiles.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It's some kind of
sea monster that

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
is probably a large unknown
seal or a large unknown whale.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think, because there's
so much going on in the oceans

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:84%
now, it's really
the new outer space.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:84%
They're pouring money
into exploring the oceans

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:90%
versus outer space right now.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And so we'll find something.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "20,000
Leagues Under the Sea,"

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.275 align:middle line:84%
we would talk about huge,
squid-looking objects

00:26:00.275 --> 00:26:01.510 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:10%
What do you think
the biggest squid

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:10%
might be in terms
of-- from tentacle

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.424 align:middle line:10%
to the back of the body?

00:26:06.424 --> 00:26:07.840 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: Well,
they have reports

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:10%
off of New Zealand of ones
that are over 100 feet long.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 100 feet?

00:26:12.385 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: 100 feet long.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.610 align:middle line:84%
We know that they've found
ones that are 40 feet long.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.014 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do they wrap
around ships and stuff?

00:26:19.014 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: They could.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:20.730 align:middle line:90%
They could.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly seem to wrap
around whales and have fights.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you find huge scars from
these large, you know, squid.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And squid is, of course,
something that was found--

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: --more recently.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a new cryptid
that became a real animal.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd you like that
calamari for dinner, huh?

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.006 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: I don't eat meat.

00:26:42.006 --> 00:26:44.604 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From a 100-foot squid?

00:26:44.604 --> 00:26:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big
are their eyeballs?

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, they're-- they
keep using the word "dinner

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:90%
plates."

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:84%
But the dinner plates
keep getting bigger,

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:84%
because their eyes-- and
they're very intelligent.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.420 align:middle line:84%
As far as any invertebrate,
they're the most intelligent--

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: --one, yes.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they're thinking,
they seem to remember.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They remember some of their
enemies as far as certain fish.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.764 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they
attack a swimmer?

00:27:07.764 --> 00:27:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: They could.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.480 align:middle line:90%
They could.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Most of them don't, because they
use flight as opposed to fight.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:84%
The reason that they get
in fights with whales

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.825 align:middle line:84%
is because the whales
eat them, like the--

00:27:19.825 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they do?

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.074 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --the
big sperm whale.

00:27:22.074 --> 00:27:24.070 align:middle line:90%
They're mostly--

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who wins the
fights most of the time?

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.365 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: 50/50.

00:27:27.365 --> 00:27:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.753 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: But I think
most of the time, the sperm

00:27:29.753 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:90%
whales eat them.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.934 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
would a squid eat?

00:27:33.934 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: What
would a squid eat?

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:84%
They'll eat anything
that gets in its way.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:84%
No, they eat a lot
of little fish.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:39.510 align:middle line:90%
They eat--

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --you know, plankton,
some of them, probably.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:43.470 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, if--

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
when you say it could
be 100 feet long,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:90%
the tentacles are how long?

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, that would
include some of the tentacles.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:57.460 align:middle line:84%
The giant squid have two
extremely long tentacles

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:90%
that go out.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of squid, they
lose those in the fights

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:90%
with the sperm whales.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But the actual squid,
upwards of 80 feet

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.150 align:middle line:84%
without the long ones
going out further.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:90%
They're massive.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And you know, some of
the missing swimmers

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and some of the missing divers
could be regarding those squid.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.738 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: It's
grave danger, yeah.

00:28:25.738 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look
at all the cryptids

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that you've studied, what is
some of your favorite ones?

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, I'm very
much into first love.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.730 align:middle line:90%
And we all are.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And so yetis are always
going to be my favorite.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: I also
really do acknowledge

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.800 align:middle line:90%
that humans are narcissistic.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:10%
And the favorite
cryptic for most people

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:55.390 align:middle line:10%
is Bigfoot, because Bigfoot has
this reflective, noble savage--

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.960 align:middle line:10%
it's a hairy version of us.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: And so people--

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somewhat
human, somewhat animal.

00:29:00.295 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And I know, after
15 years at the museum,

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:90%
people come in.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.840 align:middle line:10%
The number-one thing that
they want to talk about

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.610 align:middle line:10%
is Bigfoot, because they
want to know where they are,

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:12.750 align:middle line:10%
have I seen one?

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I've found footprints
and all of that.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:84%
But it very much is a
focus for a lot of people.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:90%
But then you go off.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.490 align:middle line:84%
People from New Jersey like
to talk about the New Jersey

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Devil, which is kind of a
conglomerate of a flying horse.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Really, 1909 was when the
Jersey Devil reports were.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.550 align:middle line:84%
People from New
Mexico and Arizona

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:90%
want to talk about chupacabras.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So you get the local
favorites that keep coming up.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
much my favorite.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the things that
does happen to me in the field

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:56.290 align:middle line:84%
is that cryptozoology
is so exciting.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Every day, there's a
new cryptid report.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Every day, there's
old ones to review.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.935 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was just
reading this morning,

00:30:04.935 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
we're in the
dozen-year anniversary

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
for the Pine Ridge, South
Dakota reports of Bigfoot.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.500 align:middle line:84%
The native peoples, which
are closer to the earth

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and closer to some of
their spiritual ancestors,

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.330 align:middle line:84%
have some very good
reports that are ongoing.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And they keep it
quiet, because Bigfoot

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:30.780 align:middle line:90%
is part of their landscape.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't want
the publicity, do they?

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.778 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: They don't
want the publicity.

00:30:33.778 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
They don't want--
the tribal police

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that talked
to me a lot 10 years ago

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:90%
and 12 years ago.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.170 align:middle line:84%
They were getting reports with
their new drug enforcement

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.691 align:middle line:84%
equipment as far
as their dash cams.

00:30:47.691 --> 00:30:49.190 align:middle line:84%
They were recording
so many things--

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were seeing them.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: They
were seeing them.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.379 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And it
was very exciting.

00:30:53.379 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they got
so much attention

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:59.330 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of the
population, they shut it down,

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:90%
because they wanted to keep--

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.750 align:middle line:84%
they call it Big
Man or Tall Man.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to shut down
their Bigfoot reports.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: John Kell brought
us "Mothman Prophecies--"

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.558 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --and of
course, opened up

00:31:09.558 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:10%
an entire genre of cryptozoology
with this creature.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:10%
>> The Mothman, as
its name suggests,

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.470 align:middle line:10%
is a humanoid cryptid described
as having glowing red eyes

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.420 align:middle line:10%
and large wings, like a moth.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.580 align:middle line:10%
While the Mothman has
remained in the zeitgeist

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:10%
and has become a major symbolic
figure in the local area,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:10%
sightings of the creature
have been relatively rare

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:10%
until it was captured by a local
while driving down the highway.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:10%
The man, who wished to remain
anonymous, spotted the creature

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.500 align:middle line:10%
and captured it on film.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.080 align:middle line:10%
The event occurred just a week
after the original sighting

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.536 align:middle line:10%
of the creature 50 years prior.

00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've got a new
book coming out on Mothman.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.326 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah,
it just came out.

00:31:48.326 --> 00:31:50.750 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Mothman--

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Evil Incarnate."

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ooh.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: In 2002, I
did my first Mothman book

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.959 align:middle line:84%
in conjunction with
Sony Screen Gems--

00:31:57.959 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --because they wanted
the real story about Mothman.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.880 align:middle line:10%
But what I noticed
afterwards, and including,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.020 align:middle line:10%
I think, a program with
you, where bad luck always

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:10%
happens in these programs.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: I go
upstairs in my house

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.550 align:middle line:90%
after I was talking to you.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:17.810 align:middle line:90%
And the light bulb bursts.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: But also, what's
more important in the book,

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:10%
I actually list the hundred
people connected to the Mothman

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.689 align:middle line:10%
story who have died.

00:32:27.689 --> 00:32:28.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tragically, too.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:29.750 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: Tragically.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:36.230 align:middle line:10%
And suicides, youthful-- you
know, mysterious illnesses.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the movies
talk about curses--

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:90%
the poltergeist curse.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't there
a bridge collapse

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:90%
involved in one of these?

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, yes, yes.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:90%
That was in 1967.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
exactly 13 months

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.590 align:middle line:84%
after the first publicized
Mothman sightings.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.150 align:middle line:90%
You had the bridge collapse.

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:90%
46 people died on that bridge.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.800 align:middle line:84%
It also-- they found out
the cause of that collapse

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:90%
was I-bar 13 broke.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And the other thing,
Mary Hyre was the reporter that

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:84%
was in conjunction with
John Keel doing all of the--

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and she died very mysteriously
at 42 years of age, two times

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.744 align:middle line:84%
13, 26 months after
the bridge collapsed.

00:33:23.744 --> 00:33:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.180 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: And the director
of the "Mothman Prophecies"

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:31.560 align:middle line:10%
movie, Mark Pellington,
the summer after the movie

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.730 align:middle line:10%
came out, his wife got a
very mysterious illness,

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:10%
died rapidly at 42 years old.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.727 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you explain
these bizarre anomalies?

00:33:39.727 --> 00:33:40.768 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: We don't know.

00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I tried
to say in the book,

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:90%
they're all very mysterious.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.700 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if the
cryptid Mothman has really

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.080 align:middle line:84%
morphed into almost a
spiritual fear animal that

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.240 align:middle line:90%
has energy and entities.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that is connected
with in-depth Mothman stories

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and investigations
tend to have accidents.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I lost a younger brother.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.520 align:middle line:90%
I lost a mother.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I lost some people
close to me as I

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:90%
was doing these investigations.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:84%
They sometimes-- sometimes,
whatever they is--

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Mothman doesn't actually
go for the eyewitness

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.340 align:middle line:90%
or go for the investigator.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:84%
The bad luck
happens around them.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.139 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: So the week
that, for instance,

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:31.050 align:middle line:84%
the Mothman movie
came out in 2002,

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.860 align:middle line:84%
the city of Point Pleasant
was overwhelmed with a lot

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.219 align:middle line:84%
of funerals, because of lot
of eyewitnesses' brothers

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.575 align:middle line:90%
and sisters were dying--

00:34:39.575 --> 00:34:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who died.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: --very mysteriously.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.489 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's bizarre.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.289 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Defying
logic and odds, right?

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: And statistics.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Because, like, "The Exorcist"
movie, the "Poltergeist" movie,

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.429 align:middle line:90%
they talk about those curses.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:84%
It's usually four
or five people.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.620 align:middle line:10%
You have a hundred people
connected with Mothman

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.680 align:middle line:10%
that have died.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's too much.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.540 align:middle line:90%
It's weird.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.456 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: It does get
scary and overwhelming.

00:35:01.456 --> 00:35:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not one to
usually get scared,

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
because people often
ask me, well, what would

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.330 align:middle line:90%
you do if you met Bigfoot?

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.380 align:middle line:90%
I would go interview it.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't run, you know?

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.795 align:middle line:90%
So-- but Mothman--

00:35:11.795 --> 00:35:13.628 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless it was
coming at you, right?

00:35:13.628 --> 00:35:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: [LAUGHS]
Mothman's a little different.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.670 align:middle line:84%
There's something more
sinister around it.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It seems to be.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And with this
creature, has anybody

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.237 align:middle line:84%
ever tried to tie in
extraterrestrials with it?

00:35:24.237 --> 00:35:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, sure.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That it
might be, you know,

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:28.490 align:middle line:84%
some kind of being
from another world?

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, the
whole thing about Mothman

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:36.350 align:middle line:84%
is, it lends itself to
extraordinary explanations.

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:90%
You have the Men in Black.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:84%
You have UFOs going up and
down the Ohio River Valley.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:84%
You have John Keel being
involved, who was--

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.360 align:middle line:84%
he actually-- I
interviewed him a lot

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:90%
before he died for my books.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm not
a ufologist, Loren.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm a demonologist.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:90%
He felt he was--

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
his expertise, yeah.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:84%
He felt he was actually
looking into the Mothman

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:84%
as a demonic form, as an
ultraterrestrial, as he

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:90%
called it.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This creature--
kind of describe--

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:90%
we saw a little video of it.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But kind of describe what
it apparently looks like.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: Well, the thing, if
you back up into the Mothman

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:20.080 align:middle line:10%
story, you'll find out that
before all of this demonology

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:10%
happened, John Keel was
talking to Ivan Sanderson

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:10%
and giving him this description.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:10%
It's about six feet tall.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.250 align:middle line:10%
It's birdlike.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.230 align:middle line:10%
It has two large wings
that come down to its side.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:37.780 align:middle line:10%
It seems to be able to go right
up by making its wings go out

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.610 align:middle line:10%
and then flying very quickly.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.890 align:middle line:84%
It can chase a car
down the highway,

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.660 align:middle line:90%
60 to 100 miles an hour.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: It has two eyes that
most people describe as red.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's always red glowing from
other forms of light, like a--

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, headlights on
a car, a street light,

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.070 align:middle line:90%
whatever, it's like that.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was an
animal-like creature.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And so Sanderson was saying,
I think it's a big bird.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.016 align:middle line:84%
I think it's some
kind of unknown bird--

00:37:08.016 --> 00:37:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a big owl,
or something like that.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.515 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah,
actually an owl.

00:37:10.515 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a friend
of mine who died

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:84%
in the last two
years, Mark Hall, who

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.510 align:middle line:90%
wrote a book on thunderbirds.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And he did a whole
chapter about Mothman.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.610 align:middle line:90%
He called it Big Hoot.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.690 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't a joke.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.990 align:middle line:84%
He really was trying to
say, this was a giant owl.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.450 align:middle line:84%
There were owls that were
four feet tall in Cuba,

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.110 align:middle line:90%
prehistoric times.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:90%
And so it could be one of those.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But what quickly evolved
is that Keel found out

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that people were dying, people
were committing suicide,

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:44.080 align:middle line:84%
people were actually reporting
Bigfoot in the same area,

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.320 align:middle line:84%
were reporting
cattle mutilations,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:84%
were reporting what they
would call Men in Black.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.706 align:middle line:90%
And so all of that was going on.

00:37:51.706 --> 00:37:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And so these
different theories--

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.820 align:middle line:90%
was it a CIA experiment?

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Was it--

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That went awry, maybe?

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Was it UFO-involved aliens?

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So this--
this creature,

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:10%
this Mothman creature that
could be extraterrestrial,

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:09.050 align:middle line:10%
could be a large owl,
could be anything,

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:10%
as you write in your
book, "Mothman--

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.010 align:middle line:10%
Evil Incarnate," you suspect
that all these tragedies that

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.269 align:middle line:10%
have occurred have something
to do with Mothman, don't you?

00:38:18.269 --> 00:38:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: I definitely
think there's

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.640 align:middle line:90%
a difference with Mothman.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not a regular
sort of cryptid.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.730 align:middle line:84%
There's almost a psychological
component to Mothman reports

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.830 align:middle line:90%
that nobody's really touched.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I try
to do in the book.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:90%
It's really evil incarnate.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.630 align:middle line:84%
It's really, something
about Mothman

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:42.115 align:middle line:84%
makes people experience evil or
actually has evil around them.

00:38:42.115 --> 00:38:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bad things happen.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And that's--
it's just the facts.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not bad luck.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:49.070 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be something else.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know yet.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't believe
in coincidence, Loren.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And one would
say, well, come on, now.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.500 align:middle line:90%
These things will happen.

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:90%
But a hundred people?

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.780 align:middle line:84%
The statistics
really go in favor

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.130 align:middle line:84%
of it looking like there's
enemy action, you know?

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.532 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody described
what the feet look like?

00:39:11.532 --> 00:39:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, that's
one of the things

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:84%
that I studied and
talk about in the book,

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:84%
is that in the early days,
which I mean '66 and '67,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.520 align:middle line:84%
it was really seen as having
wings, not having a head,

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.410 align:middle line:84%
but actually having a
sort of slight depression.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.464 align:middle line:84%
And the head would
come out of the chest.

00:39:32.464 --> 00:39:34.380 align:middle line:84%
That, you can imagine
an owl looking that way.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's kind
of like an owl, right?

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And yet, what has
happened, the eyewitnesses,

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.560 align:middle line:84%
as they were interviewed
over, and over,

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and over on these
reality TV shows,

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.160 align:middle line:84%
have come up with
humanlike descriptions--

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Features.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --that
weren't there before.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.976 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: They
talk about a head.

00:39:54.976 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:90%
They talk about feet.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They even now have
images of Mothman

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.576 align:middle line:84%
with hands at the
ends of the wings.

00:40:02.576 --> 00:40:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still wings, yeah.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But all of that is
really part and parcel

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.860 align:middle line:84%
of the media
contagion that occurs,

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.260 align:middle line:84%
that there's really
something going on

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.400 align:middle line:84%
with people
elaborating the story

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.410 align:middle line:90%
and making it more fantastic.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And actually, early
cryptozoologists in the '20s

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and '30s would talk about,
most of these cryptids, most

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.620 align:middle line:84%
of these creatures that
were seen by native peoples,

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Western society takes it in
and makes them fantastic.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: The Abominable
Snowman, for instance,

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:41.820 align:middle line:84%
is just a local
apelike creature.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.366 align:middle line:90%
But Western people--

00:40:43.366 --> 00:40:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a legend now.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: The legend
now, Western people

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.650 align:middle line:84%
brought it in, and made it
gigantic, and made it white,

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:90%
and made it horrific.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.939 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Western
society does to it.

00:40:53.939 --> 00:40:55.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's happened with Mothman.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
there's that old adage

00:40:56.938 --> 00:40:58.500 align:middle line:84%
that if you have
30 people lined up,

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and you tell a story to one,
and they pass it through,

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:05.190 align:middle line:84%
it's totally different by the
time you get to the other end.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.837 align:middle line:84%
Could be this way
with Mothman, too.

00:41:06.837 --> 00:41:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, I
definitely think it's true.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think we see it in a
lot of ghost stories and UFO

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.380 align:middle line:90%
stories.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Almost anything in what now
is called the paranormal

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:20.190 align:middle line:90%
really gets exaggerated.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, some of
these reality TV programs

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.641 align:middle line:90%
live on that.

00:41:25.641 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: They live on
it being more elaborate,

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:84%
when I think the mystery
itself, the factual mystery

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.832 align:middle line:84%
of these creatures,
is enough to keep me

00:41:34.832 --> 00:41:36.790 align:middle line:84%
going and enough to keep
a lot of people going.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you be
shocked or surprised

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.877 align:middle line:84%
if Mothman ended up
being a large bird?

00:41:41.877 --> 00:41:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: No, I wouldn't.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that part
of the story of Mothman

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:90%
is a large bird.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I do in my books
is look back to the 1920s,

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.610 align:middle line:84%
back to 100 years ago, when
the native peoples were

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.690 align:middle line:90%
talking about it.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking about
flying heads, a creature--

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and even the jalopy
reports of people

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.150 align:middle line:90%
being chased by large owls.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: So I think--

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.037 align:middle line:84%
I think the essence of a
real animal is underneath it.

00:42:09.037 --> 00:42:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know we used to talk
about thunderbirds a lot more.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that
story you told us

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.560 align:middle line:90%
about a woman who went outside.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Her little boy was
being picked up by one.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.617 align:middle line:84%
And she's swatting
it with a broom.

00:42:20.617 --> 00:42:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it dropped him.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: The Marlow Lowe
story in Logan County, Illinois.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.872 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, could
Mothman be a thunderbird?

00:42:30.872 --> 00:42:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: It could be.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:32.870 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the distinction there
is that the thunderbirds--

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.004 align:middle line:84%
and there's lots of reports
going on in southern Alaska,

00:42:39.004 --> 00:42:39.920 align:middle line:90%
by the way, right now.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still?

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And those reports tend to
look like a giant condor,

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.085 align:middle line:90%
some kind of large bird that--

00:42:49.085 --> 00:42:49.960 align:middle line:90%
from the Pleistocene.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With a 10-
or 12-foot wingspan.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.026 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're huge.

00:42:53.026 --> 00:42:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: They
actually existed.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Most people think
they're extinct,

00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:00.710 align:middle line:84%
but they might still exist,
whereas the ones in Appalachia,

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:03.710 align:middle line:84%
which are the reports of
the Mothman-like creature--

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:06.330 align:middle line:90%
and Mothman's just a local name.

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:08.880 align:middle line:90%
But they look like giant owls.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be
astounding to see, wouldn't it?

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And it would be--

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't it be scary?

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:18.030 align:middle line:84%
If you saw an owl, six or
seven feet, sitting on a road,

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:21.540 align:middle line:84%
just standing there, that
would be kind of jarring.

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, part
of what they seem to do

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.190 align:middle line:84%
is, they're able to
fold up their wings

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:90%
and look like a tree trunk.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people are driving
along in West Virginia.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:90%
They never see them.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.400 align:middle line:90%
They think it's a tree trunk.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.200 align:middle line:90%
And they also--

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
they move, right?

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:10%
And some of the reports of
Bigfoot standing near trees

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:41.714 align:middle line:10%
maybe these Big Hoots.

00:43:41.714 --> 00:43:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That could be, too.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Romantically, don't
we want to believe

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that these creatures are
much more than something

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.407 align:middle line:90%
that could be natural?

00:43:53.407 --> 00:43:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: A lot of people
do, but a lot of people

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.800 align:middle line:90%
are romantic zoologists.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.034 align:middle line:90%
And they're very happy to--

00:44:00.034 --> 00:44:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just get an answer.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.699 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah,
just get an answer,

00:44:02.699 --> 00:44:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and to know that
they're part of zoology.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Like you said earlier,
it's a very unknown world.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.160 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
animals out there.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.840 align:middle line:90%
And there are lots of mysteries.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:90%
So we may go either way.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
is that a lot of us

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.350 align:middle line:84%
tend to not want
to be pigeonholed.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:21.858 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: So a lot
of people come to me,

00:44:21.858 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and they say, you're
a cryptozoologist.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.630 align:middle line:84%
You must think that
all of these creatures

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:31.460 align:middle line:84%
have a natural, you know,
zoological explanation.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.450 align:middle line:90%
That's my basis.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I have degrees in
zoology and anthropology.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.140 align:middle line:90%
But I'm open minded enough--

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Fortian, a
follower of Charles Fort.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I can look across--

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.600 align:middle line:90%
maybe UFOs are involved.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe fourth-dimensional
beings are involved.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.420 align:middle line:10%
I don't concentrate
on those, but that

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.465 align:middle line:10%
doesn't mean that I don't
accept the possibilities.

00:44:56.465 --> 00:44:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
the easiest answer

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.450 align:middle line:84%
is the most obvious answer
most of the time, you know?

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:84%
We-- you know, if somebody
sees a flying object, most

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.320 align:middle line:84%
of the time, one could say
it's a satellite, or a plane,

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.800 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But there's always that
hidden little possibility

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.480 align:middle line:90%
that it's something else.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what drives
people like you and me, Loren,

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.854 align:middle line:84%
to keep looking
for these answers.

00:45:20.854 --> 00:45:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Absolutely.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We want to find
out what's going on.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right, right.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
even easier answer

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.530 align:middle line:84%
is, those people that are
total debunkers, that they say,

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:33.340 align:middle line:90%
they don't exist, you know, no--

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No matter what.

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, no news here.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Move on.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But we now know from studies
that fakes and hoaxes

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.580 align:middle line:90%
are only 1% of all the reports.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: They get 95% of the
publicity, 95% of the newspaper

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:49.730 align:middle line:90%
stories.

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:52.190 align:middle line:10%
They'd rather have a hoax
story, because it has

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.450 align:middle line:10%
a beginning, middle, and end.

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:57.615 align:middle line:84%
And they can move on to
their politics story.

00:45:57.615 --> 00:45:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I talked with
Linda Moulton Howe about crop

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:03.260 align:middle line:84%
formations, and I say,
you do know most of them

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.630 align:middle line:84%
are probably hoaxes,
most of them?

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And she gets all
upset, because she

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.190 align:middle line:84%
wants to believe that
these things are real.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but Linda, you
didn't hear what I said.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, most of them
are probably hoaxes.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.070 align:middle line:84%
That means, if
there's just one that

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.820 align:middle line:84%
is made under some kind of
supernatural environment,

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.800 align:middle line:90%
that's a major story.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm saying
that's a possibility.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And then she stops and goes,
hm, maybe you're right.

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: It's like the
line in the movie, you know?

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:36.560 align:middle line:90%
You mean, one in a million?

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.010 align:middle line:90%
There's a chance.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:38.810 align:middle line:90%
And there is.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:40.185 align:middle line:84%
We have to be
realistic about it.

00:46:40.185 --> 00:46:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Loch Ness creatures
and lake monsters--

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:47.750 align:middle line:84%
tell me about your
expertise there.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, I went on
expedition 1999 to Loch Ness.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:55.640 align:middle line:10%
I've written a book called "The
Field Guide to Lake Monsters

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.660 align:middle line:10%
and Sea Serpents."

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.670 align:middle line:90%
So I've really examined it.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I've been to the lakes
all over the country,

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.960 align:middle line:90%
including to Quebec.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.380 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a few lakes up
there that have lake monsters.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, in my books,
I actually talk--

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:16.940 align:middle line:84%
there's 1,000 lakes in the world
that have a defined monster.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1,000?

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: 1,000.

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.048 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: That doesn't
mean that they're

00:47:21.048 --> 00:47:23.540 align:middle line:84%
all cryptids in the way
that we know cryptids.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.830 align:middle line:84%
There could be 99% natural
animals and species.

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:31.070 align:middle line:84%
For instance, some of
these lake monsters

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:33.500 align:middle line:84%
are said to look
like alligators.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, for
instance, in Utah,

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I did a whole
chapter on the lake

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:44.255 align:middle line:84%
monsters there that all seem
to look like giant beavers--

00:47:44.255 --> 00:47:45.334 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:47:45.334 --> 00:47:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --from the
prehistoric times,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.070 align:middle line:84%
from an ice age,
from Pleistocene.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And if that's true,
then those connect up

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:56.560 align:middle line:90%
with reports in Manitoba.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Manitoba has a lot of
lakes that report creatures

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.560 align:middle line:90%
that are gigantic rodents.

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you look at
these thousand lakes,

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:06.500 align:middle line:90%
you've got to define them.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.000 align:middle line:84%
There's different
animals being reported.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the, you know,
maybe a hoax here, like in Lake

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:90%
George in New York--

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.340 align:middle line:90%
longtime hoax.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: But there's also
ones that may be wave action.

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:26.510 align:middle line:84%
The thing about lake monsters
that's sort of disappointing

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:29.600 align:middle line:84%
is, you don't have physical
evidence the same way

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.650 align:middle line:90%
you do with the land.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:32.275 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
scientists, for example,

00:48:32.275 --> 00:48:35.840 align:middle line:84%
looking for Nessie have been
looking for DNA samples.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Most recently, they're trying
to get DNA out of the loch--

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to determine
if Nessie's there.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.610 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a legend in
the Scottish highlands--

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:50.600 align:middle line:10%
a legend of a mythical
monster in the murky depths

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.310 align:middle line:10%
of Loch Ness.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.110 align:middle line:10%
And the myth lives on.

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.590 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, people have
reported sightings and even

00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:00.320 align:middle line:84%
made references
to this creature.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.370 align:middle line:10%
Some people believe it is a
long-necked plesiosaur that

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:07.340 align:middle line:10%
somehow survived the
extinction of the dinosaurs

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.100 align:middle line:10%
65 million years ago.

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:13.460 align:middle line:10%
And yet, it managed to
elude undeniable proof

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.410 align:middle line:10%
of its existence.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.530 align:middle line:10%
But a team of scientists
are on the case.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.470 align:middle line:10%
They plan on taking 300
samples of the water

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.230 align:middle line:10%
from different points
and depths of the lake.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:27.230 align:middle line:10%
They hope to catch tiny
fragments of DNA that

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:30.440 align:middle line:10%
could help identify
different animal species

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.980 align:middle line:10%
lurking within Loch
Ness's murky waters.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:38.240 align:middle line:84%
If the Loch Ness Monster does
exist, its days of hiding

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.510 align:middle line:90%
could be numbered.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do you-- so do you
think they'll ever find DNA

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:48.270 align:middle line:84%
evidence which will show that
Nessie is a creature from this

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:49.070 align:middle line:90%
planet--

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's anything
supernatural about it,

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.362 align:middle line:84%
but a creature that we just
never discovered before?

00:49:55.362 --> 00:49:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: I think there's
less likelihood that it's

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.690 align:middle line:90%
creature we never discovered.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It's more likely that it's a
creature from 10,000 years ago.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ah, like a
plesiosaur, maybe?

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well,
plesiosaur is 65 million.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.670 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: So I'm less likely--

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:13.790 align:middle line:10%
if you're from the United
Kingdom and a scientist,

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:16.430 align:middle line:10%
you think the plesiosaur
is their number-one answer.

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:20.510 align:middle line:10%
If you're an American scientist
interested in lake monsters,

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:25.910 align:middle line:10%
you really usually think
it's a mammal, a giant seal

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:27.890 align:middle line:10%
or an ancient whale.

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it may be one of those,
'cause once again, like the sea

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.100 align:middle line:84%
serpents, lake monsters
move up and down,

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.720 align:middle line:84%
which tells us
they're not a fish,

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.880 align:middle line:84%
they're not a reptile, not
even a prehistoric reptile.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.110 align:middle line:90%
They're some kind of mammal.

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Years ago, Loren, there
was a "National Geographic"

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.280 align:middle line:90%
picture--

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.890 align:middle line:90%
I always will remember it--

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that was a color
picture that I think

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.970 align:middle line:84%
some Japanese
photographers took of what

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:57.560 align:middle line:84%
looked like a flipper or
a fin deep in the loch.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.949 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it looked
like a plesiosaur fin.

00:50:59.949 --> 00:51:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, that's--

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:02.089 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know if--

00:51:02.089 --> 00:51:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: That's Robert Rines.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:03.940 align:middle line:90%
He was a--

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that was a--

00:51:05.065 --> 00:51:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, Robert
Rines, a New York scientist.

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:11.760 align:middle line:90%
And he did the side scanner.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.120 align:middle line:90%
So a flash of light goes off.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to capture that.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.084 align:middle line:84%
They had to enhance a
little, which has been--

00:51:19.084 --> 00:51:20.500 align:middle line:84%
opened them to a
lot of criticism.

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
a flipper, right?

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:22.683 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: But it was a flipper.

00:51:22.683 --> 00:51:24.050 align:middle line:90%
It looked like it was--

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.986 align:middle line:84%
but you have flippers
on seals, too.

00:51:25.986 --> 00:51:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same-- same style?

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Same style.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- convergent evolution
gives us animals in water that

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:38.300 align:middle line:84%
could be a dolphin, or a
seal, or actually, a shark.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So those kinds of
things look enough alike

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that people are
getting confused--

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --because
they sometimes--

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:49.640 align:middle line:84%
cryptozoologists get
bound up in explaining it.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And I'm kind of like Jack Webb.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Just give me the facts, ma'am.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Facts, ma'am, yeah.

00:51:54.915 --> 00:51:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Just the facts.

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: If we could
just have the facts--

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.700 align:middle line:90%
let's look at the facts.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what's really here.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And then let's go
after the evidence.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stephen Alton says that
Nessie could be a large eel.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And he says there have been
some huge teeth discovered.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, I think
that he's on better ground

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:21.500 align:middle line:84%
by looking at some of the large
tracks found on Loch Ness'

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.580 align:middle line:90%
shore that may be these eels.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a snake, almost.

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, like a snake.

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:31.170 align:middle line:84%
We do know that there's larva
of eels that have been enormous.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the larva,
the adult must be huge.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: And we think
that in some of the oceans,

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.270 align:middle line:90%
he may be right.

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they may
swim like you said, right?

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, they may be
able to do anything they want.

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:46.384 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But can you
imagine a 6-inch tooth?

00:52:46.384 --> 00:52:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.650 align:middle line:84%
How would you like to
get chomped by that?

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:50.591 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: No thanks.

00:52:50.591 --> 00:52:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:53.150 align:middle line:90%
What about Champy?

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:57.200 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: Champ is
America's Loch Ness Monster.

00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Lake Champlain, there's been
active reports since 1812.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's up
there near New York?

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: It's actually New
York, Vermont, and Quebec.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.700 align:middle line:90%
They all share Lake Champlain.

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: And it's a huge lake.

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.070 align:middle line:90%
It's very deep.

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:14.544 align:middle line:90%
Loch Ness is 1,000 feet deep.

00:53:14.544 --> 00:53:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a deep lake.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:16.626 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: It is deep.

00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there is
some depth to Lake Champlain.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And there is a way,
through water zones

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and overland, to get
to Lake Champlain.

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And there actually have been
some records of harbor seals

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:33.480 align:middle line:84%
from the ocean in
Lake Champlain.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.779 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: So there
may be something

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.182 align:middle line:90%
there that we don't know about.

00:53:37.182 --> 00:53:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that fresh water?

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:40.014 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: It's
definitely fresh water.

00:53:40.014 --> 00:53:42.590 align:middle line:84%
There's been Japanese-- I've
been there with the Japanese.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I've been with other
expeditions all the time.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And so there's American
and English expeditions

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:50.810 align:middle line:90%
going there.

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the hidden
lake monster in our backyard

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:59.180 align:middle line:84%
that people sometimes would
go all the way to Scotland

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:00.410 align:middle line:90%
to do Loch Ness--

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When it's right here.

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:02.729 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: --when
that's right here.

00:54:02.729 --> 00:54:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this tell
you about the humankind,

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:10.540 align:middle line:84%
about where we're headed as we
contemplate all these cryptids

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.720 align:middle line:90%
and creatures?

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.517 align:middle line:90%
I think it's fascinating.

00:54:13.517 --> 00:54:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: I do too.

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that it, as opposed to
the interest levels going down,

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:20.910 align:middle line:84%
there's more young
people involved in this.

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:24.350 align:middle line:84%
There's more people with higher
technology, with more DNA

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:29.300 align:middle line:84%
studies, with a lot more
very good, credible reports.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of those
scientists that I

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.560 align:middle line:90%
don't believe in lake monsters.

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in Bigfoot.

00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But I I'm open
minded, I'm skeptical,

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:40.970 align:middle line:90%
I accept or deny the evidence.

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I wouldn't
still be doing this

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:47.660 align:middle line:84%
if 60 years later,
I didn't consider it

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.885 align:middle line:84%
a strong possibility there's
new animals out there.

00:54:50.885 --> 00:54:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
one of the best, Loren.

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And of all these cryptids
that we've talked about,

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.090 align:middle line:84%
which is the one that
you think will probably

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:00.590 align:middle line:90%
come to the forefront?

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:02.600 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to say, a-ha!

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.400 align:middle line:90%
We finally found one.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: I think the one
that will be discovered

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.860 align:middle line:84%
in our lifetime will
be Orang Pendek, which

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:14.630 align:middle line:84%
is a little, four-foot-tall
creature in Indonesia that has

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:15.944 align:middle line:90%
been seen by scientists there.

00:55:15.944 --> 00:55:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that look like?

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: It's like
a little orangutan.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.640 align:middle line:90%
But it always is upright.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
little, hairy human being.

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a little
dwarf or something?

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:28.535 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know the hobbits
that people talk about--

00:55:28.535 --> 00:55:29.335 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:55:29.335 --> 00:55:32.030 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: --Homo floresiensis
that was discovered in 2013?

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:34.200 align:middle line:10%
It may be one of those.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.580 align:middle line:84%
It may be lingering-on
population

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.050 align:middle line:90%
of little, hairy creatures.

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because we're
a primate, generally,

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.330 align:middle line:90%
we'll walk kind of stooped over.

00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Right.

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is a little
more upright, right?

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Very upright.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It's-- orangutans and the
gorillas, they stoop over.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.910 align:middle line:84%
This is more humanlike, in
which it's upright all the time.

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:59.090 align:middle line:84%
That will change
anthropology forever.

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it
be a little human?

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
little human that's

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:07.010 align:middle line:84%
a little different than all
of the ones that we know.

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, pygmies are--

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:09.852 align:middle line:90%
how tall are pygmies?

00:56:09.852 --> 00:56:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well, pygmies
can be four feet tall.

00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.203 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: This one may
be even shorter, 3 and 1/2

00:56:14.203 --> 00:56:16.079 align:middle line:90%
feet, two feet tall.

00:56:16.079 --> 00:56:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fully developed?

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.470 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: Fully developed.

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:21.350 align:middle line:10%
And we know they exist, because
we have fossil evidence.

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they be what
people have called, in Ireland,

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:24.920 align:middle line:90%
leprechauns?

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Maybe,
maybe part of it.

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the leprechaun memory,
and a lot of the little people

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:36.320 align:middle line:84%
memories from around the world,
may be ancestral remembrances

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.466 align:middle line:90%
of these little people.

00:56:37.466 --> 00:56:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
wouldn't it be great

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:42.330 align:middle line:84%
if these creatures
were still alive?

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.160 align:middle line:90%
We could actually--

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not skeletons,
but the actual creatures.

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yes.

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.160 align:middle line:10%
And we could probably
put a day aside

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.870 align:middle line:10%
whenever we discover them.

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:54.650 align:middle line:10%
And it will be one that we'll
point to as the day they

discovered the little people.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Loren, for people
who want to track your work,

00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:59.612 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you?

00:56:59.612 --> 00:57:01.070 align:middle line:10%
>>COLEMAN: Well,
through the museum

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:02.750 align:middle line:10%
is probably one of
the best places,

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:05.606 align:middle line:10%
cryptozoologymuseum.com.

00:57:05.606 --> 00:57:08.660 align:middle line:10%
And there's a link
there for my emails

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:09.980 align:middle line:10%
and other correspondence.

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's probably the easiest.

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And some people
have reported hearing

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot screams in the woods.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.564 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:57:17.564 --> 00:57:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: I think
that's probably true.

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a
lower population of Bigfoot.

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways that
they're communicating

00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:26.810 align:middle line:90%
is valley to valley.

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:30.825 align:middle line:84%
So they have to vocalize
in a way that humans don't.

00:57:30.825 --> 00:57:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, keep up the
good work, would you?

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COLEMAN: Well,
thank you, George.

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.800 align:middle line:90%
It's great being here with you.

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always.

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:37.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been
fascinated in cryptids

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:41.170 align:middle line:84%
since the Abominable Snowman
when I was about 10 years old.

00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COLEMAN: Yeah.

00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing
discovery one day.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
