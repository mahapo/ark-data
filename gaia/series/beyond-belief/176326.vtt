were going to college,

When I was 14, actually, a
lot of my friends in school

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:84%
were getting into the harder
more opioids, the pain pills,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and even heroin and cocaine.

never appealed to me.

>>NOORY: Smart

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah, but a lot
of my friends are doing it,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and I probably would have
ended up going down that road,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
had I not tried psilocybin
mushrooms for the first time.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And what that did for me was,
A, it tapped me into nature,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
because I did it in
the woods, and B,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:84%
it caused me to feel like
something was being expanded.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I recognized
from everything else was

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
it felt like it would dull or
turn the dial down rather than

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
open you up to more
of your reality.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of calm
you down a little bit?

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, that's probably
what the opioids would do,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and the psilocybin, it
calmed down a part of me.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But it also it
opened up something,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to where I was able to actually
feel the beingness of trees

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:90%
and plants and animals around.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.284 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was is like
a, oh wow, effect?

00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it was the
reason why I actually

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
started going into the pathway
of a conscious or spiritual

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:90%
path.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I believe if I would have
gone down any other pathway,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I probably wouldn't have
opened up like that,

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and I probably wouldn't be
sitting here in this chair.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could have
been down the wrong path.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: A lot of my
friends went down that path,

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of them
aren't here today.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.573 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's sad.

00:02:57.573 --> 00:02:59.222 align:middle line:90%
How did you find the mushrooms?

00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: At this point,
I was not a cook yet.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I was a dishwasher, and some
of the cooks were older.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.107 align:middle line:84%
I was 14, and they
were 18, 19, 20.

00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You worked
early, didn't you?

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I did, and
I just asked them.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I was like, are you able
to get me mushrooms?

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said,
yes, and they got me--

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:90%
and ate the mushrooms.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.760 align:middle line:90%
I split it with my friends.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
We went into the woods,
and it was really

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:84%
an eye-opening
experience for me.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything I'd heard
up to that point

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
was these are a drug
is a drug is a drug.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
You take drugs, and you
should feel bad about it,

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and so that was why we
went off into the woods,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:90%
to hide to do it.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:90%
But I instantly realized.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I was like, this is
not what other people

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:90%
will classify as drugs.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that's harming my body,

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and for me, I felt that
it was definitely going

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:90%
to be my pathway for a while.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped, obviously,
when I went into the military,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and then shortly after that,
it stopped being recreational.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:10%
So I read about ayahuasca
for the first time,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:10%
and within a month, I
flew down to the Amazon,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:10%
and I was with a shaman called
Don Rober outside of Iquitos,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:10%
and I was doing ayahuasca.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow, you tried
everything, just about.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah, Yeah,
that was what it was.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
It opened me up to
wanting to try as much

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.177 align:middle line:84%
of these specific
plants as I could.

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The people who are
watching the show right now,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
you're not recommending
they run out and get

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:90%
psychedelics and start.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: No, absolutely not.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people ask
me, are they dangerous?

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, well, there's
inherent risk in everything--

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
is dangerous.

00:04:35.555 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You can drink too
much water and die from it.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.504 align:middle line:84%
So what I would say is
these are very powerful.

00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you do it in the
right set and setting,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:84%
the way our ancestors have
all the way back as far as we

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:84%
can trace them, if you do in
the right set and setting,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.760 align:middle line:90%
this brings community together.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:90%
This enacts healing.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:84%
It causes for us to
think more open-mindedly.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It breaks down the
conditioning of our culture.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So it can be done in a
very, very beautiful way.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, the way that we
look at it, if it's a drug,

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and you have to hide
in a back alley,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.287 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a good set and
setting, then of course,

00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to be good.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:84%
You can traumatize
yourself by doing it.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't recommend
it, but if you're already

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
considering doing it, the
only thing I would recommend

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
is find somebody who can guide
you in doing it correctly.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Doing it in a way where
it will be spiritual,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:90%
and it will also be healing.

has to be considered

that what the
psychedelics are doing

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:84%
is retuning the receiver
wavelength of the brain

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:10%
David Lewis Williams.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.488 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And
David Lewis Williams

00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:84%
was the guy who was finding all
the ancient rock and cave art

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.470 align:middle line:84%
that you can date back to
40,000, 50,000 years ago,

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:90%
sometimes even farther.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
finding is that these

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:84%
are the first time
that man started

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:84%
externalizing their
mind, that we know of,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and actually painting it
onto rock and cave walls,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just mundane things
that they're painting on there.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
They're actually painting
shamanic experiences

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of transforming into
hybrid creatures.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So they call them
therianthropes, man and animal

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:90%
hybrids.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And so what they've surmised,
even David Lewis Williams--

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:84%
who's not into psychedelics,
doesn't believe they're good--

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
he was even saying that
this is absolute proof

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that psychedelics and altered
states of consciousness

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
were inherent in
the human experience

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.640 align:middle line:84%
all the way back
to this time when

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
art first started coming out
and we, in a sense, came online.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
far back, of course?

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at a clip
from "Psychedelica."

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:10%
- The debate about soma and
haoma, the origins of them,

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:10%
has changed lately because
of archaeological finds

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:10%
and one of the
really important ones

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:10%
is the work of the Russian
archaeologist Victor Sarianidi.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:84%
He wrote about this
in his book "Margiana

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and Protozoroastrism,"
and Sarianidi

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
was doing work in the outer
regions of Afghanistan,

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
in an area known as the
Bactria-Margiana Archaeological

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Complex.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.855 align:middle line:84%
And in this region, he found
a number of temple sites,

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and these were big temples,
about the size of a football

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And half of the
temple sites were

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to the preparation of
this beverage, which Sarianidi

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
has identified as soma-haoma,
the sacred beverage

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Persians and
the ancient Indians.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:84%
- It is still debated whether
this lost city of Gonur Tepe

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
had a supreme ruler or simply
an elite class and high priest.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, the priests
of larger civilizations

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:84%
mirrored the role of the
predecessor, the shaman.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
- So the shaman, in
the traditional role,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.690 align:middle line:84%
is basically a liaison for
the community to this realm

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:39.749 align:middle line:90%
of the supernatural.

00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're right,
Ben, this goes way, way back.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It really does,
and actually what we just saw,

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
the Bactria-Margiana
Archaeological Complex,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:84%
is 4,000 years old, and this
wasn't just a temple complex

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:90%
where they did psychedelics.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
This was right in
present day Uzbekistan,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:84%
right on the Silk
Road, and so they

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.336 align:middle line:84%
found these large vats,
where they were making--

00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
manufacturing plant, right?

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It is
manufacturing plant

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:84%
of what you would call soma and
also the Iranian version of it,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:90%
which is haoma.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And these are
ancient psychedelics,

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:84%
but you'll hear about them
in the ancient scripts,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
saying that these are
the nectars of the gods,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
to that as well.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But what they found,
Victor Sarianidi

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:84%
found, was he took
scraping samples

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and found three
discernible plants

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
from this ancient
temple complex,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:90%
which one was cannabis.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Another one was poppy
which we get opium from,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and another one was ephedra,
which we get methamphetamines

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.060 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
But this was the natural
plant versions mixed together

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.654 align:middle line:84%
in a psychedelic compound,
really a cocktail.

00:09:43.654 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A concoction.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.786 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if anybody
died from these things.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's
really hard to know.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: ODing on them.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.397 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, you can't OD
on cannabis, the same thing

00:09:56.397 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
as you would get from eating
too much of a certain food.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So there's
no toxicity to that.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
There would be some
in opium or poppy,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and there would be some
a little bit in Ephedra.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But in the right amount, it
would turn into basically

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
like a cocktail, like
a different symphony

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.870 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelic or
psychotropic effects.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:90%
This was part of their religion.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.996 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ephedra, is that
how they got epinephrine,

00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:90%
the adrenaline-type booster?

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's closely
related, in that sense.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Ephedra is the name of the
actual plant, and we know this.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Like truckers will take effort
to stay up late at night

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
as they're driving
through the country.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's a stimulant.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Poppy seems to sedate
the nervous system,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and cannabis has a
psychedelic-like effect.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So together, it would create
this really interesting

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.760 align:middle line:84%
combination of effects,
and they would use

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:90%
this in religious ceremonies.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is possibly,
a lot of people

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:84%
such as one of the guys you
saw here, Chris Bennett,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
believes that this was
really the origin of Moses'

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
experiences and a lot of the
ancient biblical patriarchs.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:84%
They were having
these experiences

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:84%
based on these plants that
they were communing with.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when Moses went
up to get the 10 Commandments

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:84%
from God, maybe he was
on some psychedelic,

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it didn't
happen that way.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Some say that
the burning bush was either

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
an Acacia which has DMT, or
dimethyltryptamine in it which

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:84%
is a psychedelic, or it
was the cannabis bush.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this has been taken
out, revised out of the Bible.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And also possibly a big
reason as to why we actually

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
went to all the
witch hunts and where

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:84%
we're kind of demonizing people
who knew the plant kingdom,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
knew how to use
these plants, discern

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:90%
what their properties are.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.139 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you go back
and you look at the nuances,

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:84%
the official stories
that we've been fed in

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:84%
school just don't
seem to add up.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
just mentioned DMTs.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Explain again what that is,
and where does it come from?

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So
dimethyltryptamine, it

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
is the most powerful
psychedelic you can take,

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.884 align:middle line:84%
and it's very peculiar among
the other psychedelics,

00:12:00.884 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'll explain
that in a second.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:10%
But where it comes from, you
can find it in Phalaris grass.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:10%
You can find it in many grasses.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:10%
It comes in all the different
kinds of Acacia trees.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:84%
There's frogs that produce it,
possibly other animals as well,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and we produce it
inside of our own body.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
peculiar thing about it

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.370 align:middle line:84%
is we don't know why DMT
is produced in the body,

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know why
such a trace amount is

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:90%
produced in the body.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But the most peculiar
thing about it

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that the two
biggest theories out there

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:84%
is it's either prenatal
neurotransmitter,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:90%
or it's an ancestral one.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
If it's prenatal, it means
that when we were in the womb,

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
we were actually
in the DMT state.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Then, you come out
of the womb, and it's

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:84%
replaced by serotonin
which creates the consensus

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:90%
world that we call reality.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
If it's an ancestral
neurotransmitter,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:84%
then that means our
ancestors, such as Moses

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and all the biblical patriarchs,
would have actually produced

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:90%
higher amounts of DMT.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So they may have
been just naturally

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
in more of this state
than we are today.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:10%
And they say that our pineal
gland might produce it,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:10%
and our pineal gland has
atrophied over the centuries,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:10%
I would say.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible that we
are not living the same reality

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:90%
that our ancestors did.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here's another clip
from "Psychedelica" about DMT.

00:13:17.225 --> 00:13:18.025 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:18.025 --> 00:13:21.440 align:middle line:84%
- The hot topic that has
emerged from DMT studies is

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
the recurring theme of
the well-ordered structure

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
of the place it seems to
send people and the feelings

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:84%
of entities
inhabiting this space.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
There are accounts
of this happening

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
through the DMT-containing
brew ayahuasca as well.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:84%
There are sparse accounts
of other psychedelic plants

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
transporting people's
minds to other places

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:90%
to visit other worldly beings.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Even psychological
illness has been

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:90%
known to show similar traits.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
However, it is the sheer amount
of reports from DMT alone

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and the peculiar realness
of this space and the beings

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that cause for a deeper interest
in this compound's effects

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.410 align:middle line:90%
on consciousness.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Author and psychedelic
researcher Graham Hancock

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:84%
has poured over the
DMT trip reports

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and found correlations
with shamanic reports

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:90%
of altered or expanded states.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:84%
- They experience encounters
with supernatural beings,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:90%
as they construed them.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:10%
Those supernatural beings
may communicate with them

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:10%
telepathically.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:10%
This is very common in
the shamanistic trance.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
They may give them teachings,
and very often, they'll

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.780 align:middle line:84%
have a therianthropic
appearance.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:84%
They will be part
animal and part human.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.150 align:middle line:84%
- Sometimes, they
were malevolent,

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:90%
frightening, scary, threatening.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.750 align:middle line:90%
They hurt people.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Other times the
beings, or with those

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
things they encountered
that they call beings,

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.760 align:middle line:90%
were beneficence.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:90%
They did healing.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.700 align:middle line:84%
They gave advice some
predicted or showed volunteers

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:90%
the future.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Some were examining
the volunteers.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Some were putting things
into their bodies,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
but one of the hallmarks
of the interaction

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:84%
was the strength
of those beings.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do you
think the future is, Ben,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:90%
for psychedelics?

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Are more and more people going
to be experimenting and trying

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.010 align:middle line:90%
these?

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I can't
really say about that.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that I do know
is that we're not coming up

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:90%
with new psychedelics.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
They're the same things
of that nature gave us.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.146 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: But it seems, the
way that it's kind of heading

00:15:19.146 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:84%
is it's more of a
technological future.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:90%
There's electrodes.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:90%
There's implants.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
There's lasers that can actually
light up parts of the brain

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and actually induce
psychedelic-like experiences.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:90%
There's also gene editing.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:10%
So I said that DMT is
produced inside the body.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.980 align:middle line:10%
So you could use
CRISPR/Cas technology

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.920 align:middle line:10%
to go down to the gene
level and actually

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:10%
either turn off the DMT gene
or turn it on in hyper-drive.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And "DMT, The Spirit Molecule"
author that we just saw,

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:10%
Rick Strassman, he
actually believes,

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.360 align:middle line:10%
or he was at least
postulating, that if we

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:10%
were to edit the genes to be
able to cause us to produce

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:10%
more DMT, we might
actually start

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:10%
experiencing the world closer
to what our ancestors did.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
might be able to do

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:84%
things like telepathy and
strange things like that.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.206 align:middle line:10%
There's a book called
"Questions for the Lion Tamer"

00:16:10.206 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:10%
that really poses
those questions.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:10%
Is more DMT actually the cause
for things like telepathy,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:10%
telekinesis, some of the
things that even happen

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:10%
within the animal kingdom.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Such as cubs being
able to communicate

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
with their mother or their
parents from miles away,

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:84%
to where like their
voice wouldn't

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:90%
be able to capture that.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Or indigenous on the hunt
miles away, and the tribe

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
knows when they've
captured something.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
there's too many accounts

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:90%
to just push to the side.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:84%
We know that there is, in
these shamanic experiences,

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.600 align:middle line:84%
the shamans believe
that they are

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.300 align:middle line:84%
traveling to another
dimension from their body.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:84%
We know the parts of the brain,
the temporal-parietal junction,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:84%
that break down on psychedelics
that allow for this component,

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
for us to actually be
able to leave our bodies.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Some say that it's just a
breakdown in our consciousness,

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:84%
but I believe it's
a correlation.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
This is what you'll see
neurologically when you're

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:90%
actually leaving your body.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.443 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, where
does LSD fit in to this?

00:17:11.443 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So LSD,
a lot of people

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:90%
think it's just the chemical.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.290 align:middle line:90%
It's actually not.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the ergot fungus,
and what has to happen with--

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.151 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.151 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so
that's natural too.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It is, but
what you have to do,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:90%
ergot is actually poisonous.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So you actually have to
take it through a process

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:84%
to only get the tryptamine
alkaloid that is psychedelic

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and to take out all
the toxins, basically.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
don't, you're dead.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.128 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Absolutely,
but have you

00:17:35.128 --> 00:17:36.620 align:middle line:90%
heard the Eleusinian Mysteries?

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.953 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, tell me about that.

00:17:37.953 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: These
Greek mystery schools

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:84%
that Aristotle, Plato, Marcus
Tullius Cicero, Socrates,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:84%
for 2,000 years, this was like
a Burning Man type festival,

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:90%
but they would do psychedelics.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:90%
And it went on for 2,000 years.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a long time, and they
had a beverage called kykeon,

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and now they believe--

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hancock also
believes-- that this

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.630 align:middle line:84%
is Claviceps paspali which
has the ergot fungus on it.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And they would do a water rinse,
and the water-soluble toxins

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
would go away, and then
what you do I have left over

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
is this psychedelic
LSD-like compound.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
using this compound

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.480 align:middle line:90%
in their mystery rights.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:84%
They would go underground,
into the Telesterion caves,

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and they would do
these shamanic rituals.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And for the initiates,
the ones who

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:84%
are endowed with the
secret history of humanity

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and this planet,
they would go down,

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and they would have
these sonic rituals,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:84%
where they would be
chanting in these caves.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:90%
You would drink this beverage.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:84%
You would have this experience,
and then you would be--

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:84%
kind of in the same way that
our secret societies do--

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:84%
you would be allowed into the
higher echelons of government.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there this need
for humans to use psychedelics?

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.474 align:middle line:84%
What are we missing in
order for that to happen?

00:18:49.474 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think the main
thing that we're missing

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.250 align:middle line:84%
is our capacity to
think for ourselves.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.956 align:middle line:84%
Our educational system
tells us what to think.

00:18:56.956 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't teach
us how to think.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our ability to
critically think about things,

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and so we're given our patterns.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't develop
our own patterns

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:90%
by play or by exploration.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:84%
We're given our
patterns, and then we're

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:90%
told to stay within that.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we're governed
and policed by other people

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
to kind of stay within the
norm or the narrative that's

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:90%
given to us.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think what
psychedelics do, the same

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:84%
as what Burning Man does,
the same as what vacations

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and the need to go off and
do vipassana or a meditation

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:84%
retreat or even just
go off into the woods,

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.352 align:middle line:84%
is altered states
of consciousness

00:19:33.352 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:84%
is really what
we're talking about.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're always in
one mode of consciousness,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:84%
your neurology is going to start
to deteriorate and atrophy,

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:84%
because we're meant to
constantly learn until we die.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
We're not meant to just learn
something and then repeat it

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.310 align:middle line:90%
until we die.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty of psychedelics
is it's the most reliable way

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.880 align:middle line:84%
to break down our
patterning and to cause us

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:90%
to see the world in a new way.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And neurologically,
we know this.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.980 align:middle line:10%
We see that in the brainstem,
the locus coeruleus, it flashes

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:10%
or it fires every time that
we see something new, what

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:10%
they call novelty or salience.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But you could be looking at
your hand, something that's

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.269 align:middle line:84%
very mundane, on psychedelics,
it'll be flashing,

00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:84%
because you're seeing this
thing as if you're seeing it

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
happening is it also

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
breaks us out of
this default mode

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:84%
network, which is
our daydreaming

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:90%
network inside the brain.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.195 align:middle line:84%
So it floods the present moment
with more conscious awareness,

00:20:31.195 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and this is what all
the spiritual traditions

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:84%
have been trying to
do in the first place.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.465 align:middle line:84%
Because this world,
we may think it's

00:20:37.465 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:84%
that every day you wake
up it's the same world,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:90%
but it's really not.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
We see it that way,
because our patterning

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.180 align:middle line:84%
allows us to see only
those things that we have

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:90%
predictability built around.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to actually
wash our brains back down to--

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:84%
not wash the capacity to
take in new information,

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.910 align:middle line:84%
but just take all
the patterning down.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Then, we would see that
this world is actually just

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:90%
condensed, tiny vibrations.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And really it's our
command, through our DNA

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and our conscious
attention, that

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.720 align:middle line:84%
actually causes for these
vibrations to be able to alter.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is what causes
for these rifts in reality

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
for us to be able to
astral project, go

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:90%
into different realms.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you saw Graham Hancock
and Rick Strassman talking

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:84%
about, communicate with pan
dimensional beings, possibly

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.694 align:middle line:84%
alien beings from another
world or another dimension.

00:21:25.694 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how
would that work?

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.760 align:middle line:84%
How would you
communicate with an ET

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:84%
by being in this
psychedelic realm?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well,
so much of the trip

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
reports, there's thousands
of DMT trip reports.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have to make
mention to the fact

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that DMT seems to be
in a class on its own,

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.552 align:middle line:84%
aside from all the
other psychedelics,

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:84%
because all the
other psychedelics,

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:90%
they seem to warp this world.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:84%
What DMT does is it
seems to, once you

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.954 align:middle line:90%
break through this wall.

00:21:50.954 --> 00:21:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Magnifies it.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: What it does is it
transports you to another very

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:90%
structured reality.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like just a
warped, amorphous reality

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:90%
that you're in.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a very structured other
reality, and the beings

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that we come in
contact with there,

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:84%
we know that they are
extremely intelligent, far

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:90%
more intelligent than we are.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:90%
They sense our presence.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they do things
that you would hear about

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:84%
in alien abductions,
like probing you,

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.875 align:middle line:90%
strapping you to a table.

00:22:19.875 --> 00:22:20.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:20.675 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Implanting
things inside you.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they're benevolent,
and they impart you

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:90%
with great wisdom.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.947 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they're not.

00:22:26.947 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they abuse you.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they're
just bothered by you.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:84%
They're indifferent, but they
don't want you in their space.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:84%
They tell you
never to come back.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:84%
This is extremely peculiar, and
so now what people are saying

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.350 align:middle line:84%
is that DMT is also
strange, because it's only

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:90%
a 15 minute high.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, everything else is
six, eight, sometimes 12 hours.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes, and you're back.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:90%
You're completely normal.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.875 align:middle line:84%
You can hold down
a conversation.

00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What brings
you back like that then?

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.583 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Your body metabolizes
it so quickly and efficiently.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.430 align:middle line:90%
There's no toxicity.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:90%
There's no tolerance.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So now, what people
are saying, one

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of the technological
futures of DMT

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to actually
hook it up intravenously.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.720 align:middle line:90%
They call it a DMTx.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.760 align:middle line:84%
They call it DMTx or
extended-state DMT,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
where you could technically
stay in the peak state

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
for a very long period of time,
theoretically indefinitely.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason is if these
are truly intelligent,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
otherworldly beings,
and if some of them

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.690 align:middle line:84%
really do want to help us, we
have enough ecological problems

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And we seem to not have any
clue of what to do about it,

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
even though we can
point to industry,

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.400 align:middle line:90%
and we can point to the issues.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So what if we need very
large scale solutions

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:90%
in a very short amount of time?

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if we can
extend this state,

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
so we can get our
bearings, and we're not

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.260 align:middle line:84%
like feeling very like
weird in this other state,

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.980 align:middle line:90%
eventually we get our bearings.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can hold a conversation.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can actually have a
protocol, and is this contact?

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Are we actually talking about
a neurological tool for us

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
to have contact, where
we don't need a vessel?

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
This is our light body
being able to connect

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:84%
with other worldly
beings that might

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.670 align:middle line:84%
have solutions that would save
us from ecological disaster.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to
be this incredible need

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:84%
for the human body to
explore beyond our own realm,

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.769 align:middle line:84%
hence maybe the need
for psychedelics.

00:24:23.769 --> 00:24:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Absolutely,
and I wouldn't

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:90%
say that we need psychedelics.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I would just say that we
are in a state right now,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
modern consciousness
is in a state

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
where we're so conditioned
by our toys and our gadgets.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:10%
It also, the things that
we don't think about

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.850 align:middle line:10%
is how that affects
our physical body.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:10%
We're always neck forward.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
That impinges upon the fascial
system, and that causes for--

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:84%
our myofascial
system is actually

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
fiber optic and
the reason why you

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:84%
can have something graze past
one of your toes in nature,

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and you can react to that
before your nervous system

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:84%
or your brain even
receives the signal.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.156 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Funny you
mentioned that.

00:25:01.156 --> 00:25:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I was at the airport yesterday,
heading here from St. Louis,

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and everybody, Ben, has
got their smartphones,

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.560 align:middle line:90%
and they're all tilted down.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I mean I looked at a whole
row of people, and I'm going,

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:84%
are they text
messaging each other?

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But you're right, and they're
always in that position.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.445 align:middle line:90%
Can't be healthy.

00:25:20.445 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: No, and
that's why I believe

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.456 align:middle line:84%
the future is
technological really,

00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:25.580 align:middle line:90%
because that's what we see.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely where we're
heading with a virtual reality,

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and when we're talking about
psychedelics, what we're really

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
talking about is an altered
state of consciousness.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what all the
technology is doing for us.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.636 align:middle line:84%
It's putting us into
an alternate reality.

00:25:38.636 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what people
are saying now

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
is that the extended-state
DMT, that technology

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and also biology
fusing for us to be

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:90%
able to enter a different world.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that
if an asteroid were

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:84%
to hit the planet, our
genes would start expressing

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.937 align:middle line:90%
themselves differently.

00:25:53.937 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're in trouble.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right, but we adapt.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Our genes adapt,
and they do this.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:84%
We mutate when we experience
environmental stress,

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and what that's doing
is that's causing

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:84%
for us to be able to
develop a way to deal

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:90%
with a new kind of world.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if we're
in the DMT world?

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:17.030 align:middle line:84%
What if we're in an alien world,
because the DMT is allowing

an aspect of us to travel?

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if
we're in that world

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:84%
for a long period of time, like
the extended-state DMT would

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:90%
allow us?

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Will we start adapting to
those rules, that reality?

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
What if gravity,
the speed of light,

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
what if all the things
that we consider

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
to be constant in this reality
are different in that reality?

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Could we start then
transferring those abilities,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.380 align:middle line:84%
adapting to those
rules back here?

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.380 align:middle line:84%
What would that mean for us
if, with our consciousness,

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.570 align:middle line:84%
we could slow down
time or speed up

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%

>>NOORY: What's the downside
of psychedelics, Ben?

00:26:54.796 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: The downside
of psychedelics

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is you seen people going
down into the Amazon,

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing ayahuasca
ceremony after ayahuasca

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
ceremony, and they're never
integrating the experience.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:06.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They seem happy.

00:27:06.905 --> 00:27:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Some of them do.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.404 align:middle line:84%
Some of them do,
but some of them

00:27:09.404 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:84%
seem lost into the world of it,
and like I need my ayahuasca

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.427 align:middle line:90%
to feel normal.

00:27:13.427 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:90%
What does that sound like?

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.143 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That sounds like
just another addiction, just

00:27:17.143 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:84%
another reason to
use an externality

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:90%
to make us feel normal.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So I would say the downside
is the fact that there

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of people that feel
like they're uber spiritual,

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.370 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're on
some spiritual path, when

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:84%
really all they're doing is
they're taking psychedelics day

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:90%
in, day out.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're entering
into this world,

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:84%
but they never come back
into the consensus world,

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and here's why that's
very important.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:10%
There's Samael Aun Weor.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:10%
He was a Mexican Gnostic.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:10%
He believed he was
the reincarnation

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:10%
of the archangel
Samael, and so he

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:10%
believed he was a bodhisattva.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And the difference between
a bodhisattva and a nirvani,

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.279 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who
reaches nirvana, is

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:84%
somebody who reaches
nirvana and just wants

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to stay in that beautiful,
pristine, heaven-like state,

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing is
they're not entering back

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:84%
into what we would consider to
be this world, where there's

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:90%
hell on Earth in many ways.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.520 align:middle line:84%
There's also heaven on
Earth, but if you do not

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.040 align:middle line:84%
enter yourself back
into the suffering,

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:84%
if you do not enter yourself
back into the consensus world

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is
involved in, then you're

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:90%
not helping humanity.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is I'm
not pro-psychedelics.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not pro anything except
for serving our fellow man,

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:84%
doing something with real
solutions on this planet.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And that means the reason why I
would ever suggest psychedelics

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.040 align:middle line:84%
is not so you could
do something that

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%

you can get this weird tickle.

that patterning down
to a base state,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.540 align:middle line:84%

see that there's

Wim Hof that has a breathing

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:84%
technique that actually many
of the people who are actually

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.870 align:middle line:84%
speaking about their
experiences are saying, OK,

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I've done psychedelics before.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is a psychedelic
state, but I've

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.930 align:middle line:90%
done nothing except for breathe.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually
recommend people

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.570 align:middle line:84%
enter into the psychedelic
realm, or the territory,

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:84%
without doing the substances,
because A, at present, they're

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:84%
still illegal, and B, oxygen
is free and still legal,

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.430 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So far.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: So far.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can breathe
yourself into these states.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:38.310 align:middle line:84%
You can actually do things
like chanting or drumming,

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.610 align:middle line:90%
movement practices.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:84%
This is why I do
a lot of movement

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.770 align:middle line:84%
in nature, because I believe
this is what our evolution has

prepared us for.

arrive at any solutions

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.069 align:middle line:84%

00:31:50.069 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: So what do you
think of that guy, Wim Hof?

00:33:29.266 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I've
actually met him.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.754 align:middle line:90%
My wife's family is Dutch.

00:33:31.754 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that what he is?

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So I've actually
been to his house.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I trained in his pool in
the middle of January.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't it cold?

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It was very
cold, and so that's

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.032 align:middle line:90%
why they call him the Iceman.

00:33:43.032 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Because his breathing
technique is really

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to tap into the autonomic
nervous system, which doctors

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:90%
have told us is impossible.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you tap into it through
these breathing techniques,

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.550 align:middle line:84%
you can regulate your
thermal temperature.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:84%
But what also seems to
happen is you also get this,

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.320 align:middle line:84%
as he was saying, this
endogenous DMT dump,

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and so that causes for a
very psychedelic-like state.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.469 align:middle line:84%
And as you saw, the guy
who was interviewing him

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:12.370 align:middle line:84%
was talking about his experience
which sounds much like a DMT

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.305 align:middle line:90%
trip, in that sense.

00:34:14.305 --> 00:34:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So what I would say
is a lot of people

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:22.000 align:middle line:84%
are fascinated by the visuals
and just the trippiness of it.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
And I think really what we need
to do as a culture is get over

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.920 align:middle line:84%
that baseline of,
oh, it feels weird,

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and I experienced all
these crazy things.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Once we get past that, it's
like you can read a book,

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:38.915 align:middle line:84%
but if you have no way of
embodying the wisdom in it, who

00:34:38.915 --> 00:34:39.715 align:middle line:90%
cares.

00:34:39.715 --> 00:34:40.515 align:middle line:90%
It's not really--

00:34:40.515 --> 00:34:41.315 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, is this legal
or illegal to do this?

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.429 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, the breathing
technique is completely legal.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
free, of course.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:47.739 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.659 align:middle line:84%
So the breathing technique
is completely free,

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.360 align:middle line:84%
but if you were to want
to do dimethyltryptamine,

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.910 align:middle line:84%
even though it's produced
inside of our very bodies,

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:90%
it's illegal.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.969 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's illegal.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's schedule I.
It's the most illegal out of all

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.256 align:middle line:84%
the scheduling,
for all the drugs.

00:35:00.256 --> 00:35:00.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about ayahuasca?

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:05.307 align:middle line:84%
If you had ayahuasca in your
car, and you're driving,

00:35:05.307 --> 00:35:06.640 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get pulled over.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Don't do that, by the
way, unless you're part

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.240 align:middle line:90%
of a Native American church.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kids, don't
do this at home.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So ayahuasca, the
main active ingredient in it

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.951 align:middle line:84%
is dimethyltryptamine which
comes from these Chacruna

00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:90%
leaves.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:23.980 align:middle line:84%
The ayahuasca vine actually
has an MAOI inhibitor,

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.619 align:middle line:84%
because if you were
to just eat DMT,

00:35:26.619 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:90%
your liver would break it down.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You would never
experience anything.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So you need this other
component to it to, in a sense,

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:84%
mix with it, so it can pass
the blood-brain barrier

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and actually give you
a six-hour experience

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.580 align:middle line:84%
of dimethyltryptamine with
these other botanicals.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And the most peculiar
thing about it

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:84%
is how did the
shamans know this?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.390 align:middle line:84%
In the Amazon, there's
so many different species

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.390 align:middle line:84%
that you would win the
lottery twice before you ever

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.040 align:middle line:90%
come across this combination.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.166 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:35:56.166 --> 00:35:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So how did they
figured this out?

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
because they were actually

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.800 align:middle line:90%
producing more endogenous DMT.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Endogenously just means
that we produce it

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.300 align:middle line:84%
in our own body
instead of having

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to get that very same
neurochemical endogenously,

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.070 align:middle line:90%
from an outside source.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.620 align:middle line:84%
When the ethnobotanists,
in the early parts

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.770 align:middle line:84%
of the 1900s or late
1800s, were asking,

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:19.960 align:middle line:84%
how did you know to combine
these plants to gather

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:90%
this experience?

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:24.880 align:middle line:84%
They said, the plants told us,
and not only, they don't talk,

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.130 align:middle line:84%
they sing which is
a higher art form.

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher faculty
of communication.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So everywhere,
peyotes, peyote shamans

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.290 align:middle line:84%
would say that they
found out that this

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.450 align:middle line:84%
was a psychedelic cacti,
because it sang to them.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.064 align:middle line:84%
And many other
people, many other

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:90%
like witches or herbalists--

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Too bad
we can't record it.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:90%
It would be amazing.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we're starting
to get to the point

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:50.140 align:middle line:84%
where there is a technology
that can not just

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.200 align:middle line:84%
show the photons that are
being emitted by plants

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.890 align:middle line:84%
but actually pick up on
some of the resonance.

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Everything inside of our
body, our muscles, everything

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:84%
is vibrating, and
there is a tone to it.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:84%
We hear things on a
different spectrum.

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.940 align:middle line:84%
If we were able to hear it, if
you were able to amplify that--

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and also slow it down, because
they hear things far faster

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.170 align:middle line:90%
than we do--

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.880 align:middle line:90%
it would sound like a symphony.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.640 align:middle line:84%
It would actually sound
like it's being sung to you,

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and tone can actually
match to color

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and actually has a mathematical
equation evolved in it.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
actually talking about

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:29.470 align:middle line:84%
is in nature is structured a
language that speaks before we

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:90%
even arrived on this planet.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you tap back into your
ancestry, and that's all

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.640 align:middle line:84%
I believe these
plants are doing.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.137 align:middle line:84%
It's not taking
you somewhere else.

00:37:38.137 --> 00:37:39.220 align:middle line:90%
It's bringing you deeper--

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.344 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bringing you back.

00:37:40.344 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Within,
and everyone who

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I've ever met, that's done
psychedelics in the right way,

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:90%
they say, this was familiar.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I was coming home.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:90%
I remember this space.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I remember this feeling, and I
was experiencing my ancestors,

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and I remember now that life is
one continual phenomenon, inner

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and outer, past,
present, and future.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
experiencing.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can we
naturally increase

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.530 align:middle line:84%
the DMT in our systems, which
you said is very minimal?

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.010 align:middle line:90%
How can you naturally do that?

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think
what we have to do

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:14.890 align:middle line:84%
is we need to understand
more of our ancestral diets,

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.480 align:middle line:90%
our ancestral movement.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And we need to understand
that every one of us,

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:20.350 align:middle line:90%
we have bacteria in the gut.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:26.360 align:middle line:84%
We actually have 99% of our
genetic makeup is microbial.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not even human, and so we--

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.960 align:middle line:84%
our body, what we call a
human being, Ben and George--

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:84%
we are actually an extension
of the microbial kingdom.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The plant kingdom
is an extension

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.100 align:middle line:84%
of the microbial
kingdom, and we produce

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.100 align:middle line:84%
the same neurotransmitters
as the plant kingdom.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are actually
an extension of the plant

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:46.760 align:middle line:90%
kingdom.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:90%
So we turn our roots inside.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.440 align:middle line:84%
We put food inside, so we
can move around the Earth

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and gather experience
more quickly,

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:54.680 align:middle line:90%
and that's all this is.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.460 align:middle line:84%
That's even what computers are
as data processing at quicker

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.780 align:middle line:90%
and more efficient rates.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.900 align:middle line:90%
So how can we produce it more?

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I believe we need to
get our fascial system,

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:09.660 align:middle line:84%
our connective tissue, back
into fiber optic health.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when we sit
8, 9, 12 hours a day,

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.470 align:middle line:84%
our fascia gums up,
and it sticks together,

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.390 align:middle line:90%
and it's no longer fiber optic.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.490 align:middle line:84%
We're not sharing information
at light speed anymore.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't have natural
diets anymore.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Our food isn't even as
natural as, let's say,

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.850 align:middle line:84%
the oranges and the
apples and all the berries

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors ate, because
we're tilling the ground.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.950 align:middle line:84%
We're severing
biological connections.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poorly fertilized.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Absolutely, and
we're lowering biodiversity.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.880 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is like, the
more diversity that we

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.940 align:middle line:84%
can experience-- and this is
why we move around the world

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:84%
is so we can gather more
diverse information,

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's what our plants
are not experiencing.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.470 align:middle line:90%
So our food is dimwitted.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.660 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming
dimwitted because--

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.160 align:middle line:90%
and this is on a mass scale.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.390 align:middle line:90%
This is everybody.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So the best thing that we
could do to actually produce

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.340 align:middle line:84%
more DMT in our body--
if that's what we're

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.770 align:middle line:84%
going for, which
for me, I believe I

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:07.160 align:middle line:84%
want to tap into reality
a lot more than I am now.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So we need to move
more naturally.

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:10.580 align:middle line:84%
We need to move
more uninhibitedly.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.360 align:middle line:84%
We need to breathe
more naturally,

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.390 align:middle line:84%
the same thing the
yogis are telling us.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:15.900 align:middle line:90%
We need to be more humble.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.380 align:middle line:84%
We need to realize that
other people in our world

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.180 align:middle line:84%
are actually going to teach
us, and everyone has a lesson,

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.310 align:middle line:90%
and we need to be serving.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.204 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not everybody
thinks that way.

00:40:24.204 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: No, not
everybody does,

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that that's
a product of our culture

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.430 align:middle line:90%
and our civilization.

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do you see
as the future for humanity?

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.050 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen to us?

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think we're
moving in the direction

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of artificial intelligence at a
rate in which the mass majority

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.690 align:middle line:84%
has no idea what the
actual effects of that are.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That may
not be a good thing.

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It may
not, and the thing

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:51.320 align:middle line:84%
is this technology is a tool,
and so what we need to look at

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.850 align:middle line:90%
is it's a very powerful tool.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, who is at the helm
of wielding that tool?

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.002 align:middle line:90%
You're not.

00:40:59.002 --> 00:41:00.602 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it God?

00:41:00.602 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I wouldn't
say it's God.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's a specific
grouping of families,

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:90%
and I would say that--

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.290 align:middle line:84%
let's just take a
look at it this way.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.900 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take a
look at Silicon Valley,

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.550 align:middle line:84%
this is the major high-tech
hub for the world,

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
artificial intelligence

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.000 align:middle line:90%
is coming out of this area.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.700 align:middle line:10%
This is on the heels of
the psychedelic revolution,

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.420 align:middle line:10%
and people like
Timothy Leary, who

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.600 align:middle line:10%
was a big advocate
for psychedelics.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.741 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He was hated
by people in his day.

00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:30.740 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Very much so.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.281 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Richard
Nixon thought he was

00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:33.890 align:middle line:10%
one of the worst people ever.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: He was
public enemy number one.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: For sure, because he
was talking about psychedelics,

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.290 align:middle line:84%
but at the end of
his authorship,

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.604 align:middle line:84%
he was talking about
artificial intelligence.

00:41:41.604 --> 00:41:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that there
is something about how

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:90%
psychedelics were hijacked.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.817 align:middle line:84%
They used to be called
sacred plant medicines.

00:41:47.817 --> 00:41:48.650 align:middle line:90%
They were medicines.

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.581 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They were used for
healing since the dawn of time,

00:41:51.581 --> 00:41:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and then in a blink of an eye,
in our evolutionary time scale,

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.770 align:middle line:90%
they turned into psychedelics.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.480 align:middle line:84%
They turn into this
thing that makes

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.810 align:middle line:84%
you have these wild experiences
and become promiscuous and want

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:08.630 align:middle line:84%
to drop out and leave your
job and walk around barefoot.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.180 align:middle line:84%
That was really, I
think, more of a product

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.540 align:middle line:84%
of what the media was telling
us psychedelics are doing.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
tail end of that--

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.746 align:middle line:84%
because the CIA definitely
got very into psychedelics

00:42:18.746 --> 00:42:20.495 align:middle line:84%
and how it could be
used for brainwashing.

00:42:20.495 --> 00:42:21.453 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They sure did.

00:42:21.453 --> 00:42:22.730 align:middle line:90%
They tested it on people.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.770 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: They tested it on
many people, a whole town.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:10%
Pont-Saint-Esprit in France
was dosed aerosol LSD.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Didn't they
have a CIA agent

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.080 align:middle line:10%
who jumped out of a window?

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I've heard that,
yeah, out of a window.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that story
many, many times, and this

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.930 align:middle line:84%
was a guy that actually realized
that this isn't working.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:84%
What the CIA is
trying to do with it,

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:84%
what they're finding out,
is that it's actually not

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.710 align:middle line:90%
good for brainwashing.

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:84%
It's harder to brainwash
people once they're

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.217 align:middle line:84%
given psychedelics, because
then you're breaking down

00:42:53.217 --> 00:42:54.800 align:middle line:84%
their patterning,
and they're starting

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.202 align:middle line:90%
to see, what is this matrix?

00:42:57.202 --> 00:42:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Frank Olson was the
guy who jumped out the window.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:00.659 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: That's right.

00:43:00.659 --> 00:43:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think he went
nuts on LSD or something.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well,
that's very possible,

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.030 align:middle line:84%
but I think a lot
of those stories

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.690 align:middle line:90%
are really media-driven.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.920 align:middle line:90%
They're very exaggerated.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.587 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe he
thought he was a bird?

00:43:13.587 --> 00:43:15.336 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, I can
say that I've had--

00:43:15.336 --> 00:43:15.350 align:middle line:90%


00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that possible?

00:43:16.433 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Well, no.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.390 align:middle line:84%
For me, I like-- so
here's what I would say.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Is it that?

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Is it the actual
substance, or was it

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.220 align:middle line:90%
this person's predisposition?

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.157 align:middle line:90%
Because we know that--

00:43:27.157 --> 00:43:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, both.

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: LSD can exacerbate.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.910 align:middle line:84%
If you have a predisposition
towards schizophrenia,

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.400 align:middle line:84%
we know that LSD
can exacerbate that,

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.890 align:middle line:84%
but so can almost
getting hit by a car.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking
about is this is a tool.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it can open you
up to a flood of information,

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.580 align:middle line:90%
but if you're not ready for it--

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:48.420 align:middle line:84%
like, we're all going to one day
learn that we are going to die.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But if a child learns
that way too early,

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.950 align:middle line:90%
you can traumatize that child.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
is it LSD and only LSD

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:58.884 align:middle line:84%
that's responsible for
people doing stupid things?

00:43:58.884 --> 00:44:00.300 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't think
we need to blame

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.370 align:middle line:84%
LSD for people
doing stupid things

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and harming themselves,
because we see it all

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.600 align:middle line:90%
every day without psychedelics.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.090 align:middle line:84%
We see it without
opioids as well.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:84%
We see it just with
ideas proliferating

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.690 align:middle line:90%
in people's brains.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
"Esoteric Agenda."

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: OK, so "Esoteric
Agenda" is a movie

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:90%
that I made back in 2007.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So this was a film
where I was really

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:27.240 align:middle line:84%
kind of getting into what are
the Cabal, or our overlords,

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.800 align:middle line:90%
really planning for us?

we're clearcutting trees

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.880 align:middle line:84%

them to the ground.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.340 align:middle line:84%
We're pushing nature
out of our habitats.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.960 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, we're
divorcing ourselves

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.551 align:middle line:84%
from nature in every way
imaginable-- our diets,

00:44:42.551 --> 00:44:43.550 align:middle line:90%
our movement, our minds.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And quickly too.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Sadly.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.220 align:middle line:90%


00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Very,
very quickly, and so

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.650 align:middle line:84%
what I've started noticing,
when I started looking into it,

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.500 align:middle line:84%
was there's this thing
called Agenda 21.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically an agenda
for the UN, under the guise of,

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.479 align:middle line:84%
oh look, we're
destroying nature.

00:44:58.479 --> 00:44:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But this is happening.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: This is
happening right now,

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and under the guise
of the UN saying,

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.570 align:middle line:84%
look, we're destroying
the place, people,

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.160 align:middle line:84%
humanity is
destroying the place.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is
eventually move people

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.090 align:middle line:90%
into these mega-cities.

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And when we move them
into a mega-city,

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:19.110 align:middle line:84%
we can then let nature come
back into its full glory.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Because we people,
we humans, are

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:23.547 align:middle line:84%
the cause of all
the destruction,

00:45:23.547 --> 00:45:24.880 align:middle line:90%
and I don't believe that's true.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.213 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it's all people.

00:45:26.213 --> 00:45:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's a very
select group of people

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.450 align:middle line:90%
with a very specific agenda.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And now, because Agenda
21 or sustainable

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.940 align:middle line:84%
development started getting
into the public mind,

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and people were
like, absolutely not.

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:42.780 align:middle line:84%
You're not shoving 99% of the
population into 1% of the land.

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're like, OK, we'll
stop calling it Agenda 21.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll start calling
it Agenda 2030,

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.950 align:middle line:90%
and that's where it's at now.

The world cannot support 6

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:09.050 align:middle line:10%
the plan behind sustainable
development includes population

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.920 align:middle line:10%
control.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.280 align:middle line:10%
It's a program for land use
control, education control,

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.930 align:middle line:10%
and population control.

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:17.570 align:middle line:10%
The leaders of the
sustainable movement

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:20.600 align:middle line:10%
say that the world's human
population should not

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.820 align:middle line:10%
exceed 500 million people.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:84%
That's a 93% reduction
of today's population.

>>NOORY: They want to
eliminate the middle class.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:46:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Here's why
I believe they want

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.386 align:middle line:90%
to eliminate the middle class.

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:04.260 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be this
strife, and the reason

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.730 align:middle line:84%
why we've had a
middle class seems

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:08.040 align:middle line:84%
to be because there always
seems to be revolution.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.740 align:middle line:84%
If there's only two classes,
the upper class and the lower

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.350 align:middle line:84%
class, without the middle
class, then there's

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:17.850 align:middle line:84%
revolt. But I don't believe that
this select group of people--

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:84%
like the Bushes, you heard he
was in Prince Charles's yacht--

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.670 align:middle line:84%
there's a very small
select group of people.

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They live well.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They live
very well, and they

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.220 align:middle line:90%
have most of the wealth.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.930 align:middle line:84%
They own most of
the land, and they

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:30.270 align:middle line:84%
create most of the
policies that we live by,

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:32.490 align:middle line:90%
whether we choose to or not.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
they don't live by.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They don't live by
that, because the whole thing

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:37.470 align:middle line:90%
is rigged.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Money does not flow
down to the people.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.620 align:middle line:90%
It always flows up.

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Its rigged that way.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It's been proven to
be rigged that way.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So they don't just want to
eliminate the middle class.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I understand where he
was going with that,

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:51.240 align:middle line:84%
but they actually
want to eliminate

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.750 align:middle line:84%
much of the population,
because we don't need--

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I keep saying we.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:57.690 align:middle line:84%
It's actually this
small group of people--

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:01.030 align:middle line:84%
don't need seven,
eight billion people,

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.550 align:middle line:90%
but they do need a workforce.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So they don't want to eliminate
everybody that's not them.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.750 align:middle line:84%
They just don't need
this amount of people,

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.770 align:middle line:84%
because what they
believe that we are are

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:12.270 align:middle line:90%
useless eaters, in that sense.

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:15.090 align:middle line:84%
We're consuming too
much, when really we're

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.090 align:middle line:84%
following the protocols
they set in motion,

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and so this is,
if you ever heard

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.940 align:middle line:84%
David Icke talk about
Problem-Reaction-Solution.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.200 align:middle line:90%
They create a problem.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.630 align:middle line:84%
We react to it, and they're
like, oh, you want a solution?

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:28.530 align:middle line:90%
We have one.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Look, the Patriot Act
was already written.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:35.430 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to have been
written before 9/11.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
types of scenarios

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.510 align:middle line:84%
where we really have
to start questioning,

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:40.890 align:middle line:90%
what is the endgame?

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you what
I think the endgame is.

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think
the endgame is

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:48.190 align:middle line:84%
by using artificial
intelligence saying, listen,

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.320 align:middle line:90%
this is artificial.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.970 align:middle line:90%
It's completely unbiased.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.730 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't care if you're
black, white, male, female.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's unemotional.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's unemotional,
but what it sees

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.580 align:middle line:84%
is, oh well look, who's
destroying the planet?

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.665 align:middle line:84%
We people, we need to come up
with a protocol to fix this.

00:49:02.665 --> 00:49:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do is
we're going to start pushing

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.630 align:middle line:84%
people into these
small mega-cities,

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:09.180 align:middle line:84%
let nature go back
to where it was,

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:13.320 align:middle line:84%
when really the outcry for this
is not going to be heard until

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.774 align:middle line:84%
after the fact,
because we know--

00:49:14.774 --> 00:49:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's too late then.

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Tiptoe into tyranny.

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in that respect, I
think what the endgame is, well

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.090 align:middle line:84%
look, this unbiased
intelligence,

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:26.430 align:middle line:84%
this artificial
intelligence, is telling us,

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.050 align:middle line:90%
this is what we need to do.

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to hand
it over to this solution.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.160 align:middle line:84%
We all need to, in a sense,
follow this protocol which

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.350 align:middle line:84%
is going to allow nature to
bounce back, and we'll be fine,

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:40.230 align:middle line:90%
but we have no understanding.

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.900 align:middle line:84%
We already know what
it's done to humanity

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.970 align:middle line:84%
by taking hunter-gatherer
groups and putting them

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:47.130 align:middle line:84%
into small civilizations,
putting them

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:50.640 align:middle line:84%
into an unnatural environment,
placing an economic matrix

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.080 align:middle line:84%
around it, so people
think differently.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.360 align:middle line:90%
You think in terms of money.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.210 align:middle line:84%
You think in terms
of, like, what am I

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.020 align:middle line:84%
going to get for that
thing that you have?

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.830 align:middle line:84%
For my time, how much
can I value that?

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So one person can afford
food, another person

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:07.140 align:middle line:84%
can't afford food,
and we just call

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.230 align:middle line:84%
this the economic
inevitability, when really it's

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.230 align:middle line:90%
a rigged system.

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So the endgame truly,
in my personal opinion,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.980 align:middle line:84%
is a reduction in
the population,

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.600 align:middle line:84%
is a divorce from
our nature, so we

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.440 align:middle line:84%
don't ask the relevant
questions until it's too late.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.856 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
scary stuff, Ben.

00:50:21.856 --> 00:50:24.207 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they're going
to be able to pull this off?

00:50:24.207 --> 00:50:26.040 align:middle line:84%

they're capable of it?

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:28.110 align:middle line:90%

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:29.220 align:middle line:90%

capacity to wake up?

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we fight back?

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.608 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's not
through psychedelics.

00:50:35.608 --> 00:50:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll say that, but
the one thing is is we

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:40.140 align:middle line:84%
do need to find methodologies
by breaking down

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the patterning and
the conditioning

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:45.030 align:middle line:84%
of thinking that this is
a normal state of affairs

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.830 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:49.530 align:middle line:84%
That thinking that clearcutting
in 15 years a plot of land

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:51.780 align:middle line:84%
the size of Germany in
the Brazilian rainforest

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.600 align:middle line:90%
alone is normal.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.070 align:middle line:84%
That destroying and
bringing biodiversity

00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:58.290 align:middle line:90%
down to almost zero is normal.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:00.540 align:middle line:84%
That eating things
that are not natural,

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that are closer to
cardboard and closer

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to cyanide than actual food
that our ancestors used to eat.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Thinking that all of this is
normal, what we need to do

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:13.620 align:middle line:84%
is really start coming
together as a community,

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.370 align:middle line:84%
because more than psychedelics,
more than breathing techniques,

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:21.810 align:middle line:84%
more than yoga, more than almost
anything except meditation,

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.910 align:middle line:90%
community is our mirror.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Our neighbors are going to be
the ones that are telling us,

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.720 align:middle line:90%
you're out of line.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.280 align:middle line:90%
You're not thinking correctly.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.840 align:middle line:90%
You're not thinking soberly.

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.895 align:middle line:90%
We need to come together.

00:51:31.895 --> 00:51:33.270 align:middle line:84%
We need to actually
do something.

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:34.680 align:middle line:90%
We're destroying our habitat.

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.320 align:middle line:84%
No other creature in
nature destroys its habitat

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.870 align:middle line:84%
like we do, and we
think it's normal.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We need better
community, and I also

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.700 align:middle line:84%
think that technology
is what's separating us.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.990 align:middle line:90%
It's divorcing us.

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It's causing for
trolling, because we

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:50.560 align:middle line:84%
can be extremely mean
behind a computer

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.880 align:middle line:84%
to people that we would never
be that mean to in person.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So what's really
happening here is

00:51:56.410 --> 00:52:00.380 align:middle line:84%
we need more face-to-face,
real, human interaction.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.690 align:middle line:90%
We need more community.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:04.630 align:middle line:84%
We need to come together
under the arts, like music.

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:06.730 align:middle line:84%
We need to think
more abstractly,

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and we really need
to start questioning,

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.980 align:middle line:84%
what is this grid, this
matrix, this control system

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:12.860 align:middle line:90%
that we're in?

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.430 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
the reason why you'll

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:16.930 align:middle line:10%
see fluoride in the water.

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:19.000 align:middle line:10%
It was used in the Gulags
in the internment camps

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.252 align:middle line:10%
to keep us docile.

00:52:20.252 --> 00:52:22.210 align:middle line:10%
I think that's why there's
so much distraction.

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:10%
I have no problems with sport.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I think sport used
to be something

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:27.790 align:middle line:84%
different in our
ancestral times,

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:29.389 align:middle line:84%
because we used to
lift each other up

00:52:29.389 --> 00:52:31.680 align:middle line:84%
with our physical prowess
and our superhuman abilities.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We will win, Ben.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.000 align:middle line:90%
We will.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I totally believe so.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Thank you very much.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, it's amazing
when you tie in psychedelics

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.240 align:middle line:10%
to things that are happening
on this planet right now.

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It makes a lot of sense,
and it's all about control,

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and we need to make
sure we stop that.

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:50.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:59.008 align:middle line:90%
