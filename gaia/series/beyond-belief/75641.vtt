00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:07.362 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.574 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.412 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.412 --> 00:00:19.245 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:26.369 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with
another special edition,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:10%
with our special
guest Ken Klein,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:10%
who is an author, filmmaker,
and a prophetic investigator.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I debated with
myself, do we do this show?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're going to
hear over the next 30 minutes

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
may scare the living
daylights out of you,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:84%
because it has to
do with Lucifer,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:84%
and it has to do with prophetic
times that we're in right now?

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Maybe!

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Ken Klein back on
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Ken.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.844 align:middle line:84%
>> KEN KLEIN: Good
to be back with you.

00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:02.122 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The devil, Lucifer.

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Lucifer

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: This fallen angel.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Absolutely.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did he fall out
of grace with the man upstairs?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Well, he was moved
from a cherubimic order

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:10%
as an archangel over cherubim,
co-chaired with Gabriel,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:10%
to an office call the
morning star office.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:10%
That morning star
office oversaw how

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:10%
the creation would
be put together.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle line:10%
And he rifled through the
codes of these creator angels

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:10%
and started doing
his own twisted--

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: His own thing.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: His own thing.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And so because of that, it
started a war in our galaxy,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
in the heavens, or
the Bible says heaven.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But in God's domain, there's
no wars, but in the universe

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:90%
there's lots of wars.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of stuff going on
out there, but in our galaxy

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:84%
he was principally responsible
for starting a war.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is explained
in Revelation 12.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And for that, he was--
had came before a court,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and they determined
that he would

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:84%
have to leave his angel body,
magnificent thing, explained

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:84%
in the book of Ezekiel, and
thrown down to the Earth,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and take on human form,
which he refused to do.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And so he's disembodied, as
we understand body-spirit,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to set up his
own government on this planet.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Today we call it
the New World Order.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But he is here, now.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Oh, he's been
here for a long time.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.411 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Did not want to come?

00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Well, no
he filed an appeal.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:90%
And that has not yet been heard.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's waiting.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What happens
if he wins on appeal?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: He won't
win on appeal.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He won't?

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: There's too many
witnesses that are being set up

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.859 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:40.962 align:middle line:90%
And he's not going win.

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's like
a court of law.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.711 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: It is a court of law.

00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And the witnesses
are us, actually.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Huh!

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.811 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: We're going
to witness, in that,

00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be the witness.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:10%
We'll be the jury
and the witnesses.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:10%
And the judges will meet.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And there will be this case
that has to be heard, yet.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's called a Great
White Throne judgment.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so he was thrown down, but
he still manages and maintains

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:90%
the ability to create.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does he have
underlings with him?

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: When he fell,
he fell with the ophanim,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
these creators, they were
judged along with him.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were sentenced
to a judgment, as well.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:84%
We'll do another show
on that, down the road,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
if you want to, on their
involvement in the story.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:90%
But he still creates.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is a demonic creation.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a Luciferian creation.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.154 align:middle line:84%
And we all see that
all over the place.

00:03:35.154 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And evil and wars.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: And wars.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.395 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All this?

00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: And we
get insight-- yes.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.596 align:middle line:90%
All that.

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
The war that was in
heaven has come to Earth,

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's a manifestation of
what happened in the heavens,

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and now on Earth.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And he pits us, one
against each other.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
He's very skillful.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, then he's done a
pretty darn good job at what he

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:90%
does.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.385 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And so these things
that we know about him

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:84%
are expressed in the Book
of Revelation in codes.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:90%
He's a code maker.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything starts with a code.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
We're learning about DNA,
which is a code about--

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.666 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a code.

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: It's a code.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:10%
I think a good way
to look at it is,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:10%
in World War II Hitler
used the Enigma code.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was cracked
by these cyphers

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
at Bletchley Park in England.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:84%
They broke the code,
and it was principally

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:90%
why we were able to win the war.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've done
is cracked some codes

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of
Revelation that have

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:84%
to do with how he's been working
and dealing with what he's

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
trying to pull off
on this planet,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and has been doing
for some time.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And so my-- and I'm not
trying to push my book,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying-- my book
is kind of like a game plan.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, no.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not a matter of pushing.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's let the world
know what it is.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: It's a game.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.940 align:middle line:10%
You know when I played
pro ball, they'd

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:10%
give us a scouting
report on our opponent.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:10%
And this is kind of like a
scouting report on Lucifer,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:10%
so we know how to deal with
him and what he's doing.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the average person
cannot see and break through

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:90%
the codes.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a long
time to crack these codes,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and many years of
research and study.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And in the Book of Revelation,
we get insight into the codes

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that God has put there
for us to understand.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
But they're really
satanic codes.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are these like
the Bible codes, Ken?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, no, no, no.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:90%
No, not at all.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: This is different?

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.029 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: This is
totally different.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of Revelation, these
codes are explained as beasts.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Now they're not monsters,
but they're monstrous.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
They're symbolic
representations of what

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.974 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer's been doing,
and ultimately--

00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And will do.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: -- will do.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So the first code is a beast
that comes up out of the sea,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and it has seven
heads and ten horns.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.985 align:middle line:84%
Now there's no
counterpart on this earth

00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:90%
for anything like that.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's obviously representing
something that manifests.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But it manifests over
a long period of time.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:90%
And so you cannot detect it.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And so these seven
heads are explained

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
later on in the
Book of Revelation.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you get some
insight into it.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.264 align:middle line:84%
It says the seven heads
are seven mountains.

00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Now they're not
literal mountains.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of expositors of prophecy
say, well, this is Rome.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:90%
This is the seven hills.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not dealing with Rome.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:84%
The seven heads are
seven mountains.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And the seven heads
are seven kings.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are there arguments
over the interpretation?

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Absolutely.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
They're seven kings,
because the scripture

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
itself says they're not literal
mountains, they're seven kings.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes on to
say, five have fallen,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.304 align:middle line:84%
one is, and one
is about to come.

00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there will come
an eighth out of the seven.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.084 align:middle line:84%
So you go like, whoa, this has
already messed up my brain.

00:06:43.084 --> 00:06:45.125 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how to
begin to think about it.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: But when you
look back through history,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
there's only one
way to look at this.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The first head was Egypt, which
was a world empire, Assyria

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that came later,
Babylon came next,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.560 align:middle line:84%
the Medes and the Persians,
Iran, and then Greece.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Five have fallen.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.880 align:middle line:84%
By the time this
book was written--

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was Rome
in there at all?

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: The five that were
fallen are the ones I just

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.610 align:middle line:84%
mentioned-- Egypt, Assyria,
Babylon, Medo-Persia,

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:90%
and Greece.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
One is, which was the
one that was in existence

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:84%
during the time of
John, which was Rome.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.975 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: That was
the sixth head.

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: And then it says
there's one about to come.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Now most prophecy teachers say,
well, the one that's to come

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:90%
is the Antichrist.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And I disagree with
it wholeheartedly,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
because those heads are
mountains or kingdoms.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So the seventh
head is a kingdom.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's only
been one kingdom

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
since the fall of
the Roman Empire

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
that comes close to
answering what it would be,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:90%
and that was the British Empire.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't want to
thank disparagingly

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:84%
about the place of
our mother tongue.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.725 align:middle line:10%
But England
controlled the world.

00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:50.430 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Yes, it did.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: They controlled China.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:10%
They controlled India.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:10%
The sun never set.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: But it began to wane.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: The sun never
set on the British Empire.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And when the Founding Fathers
of this country came over here,

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to
break out of the grip

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:90%
of that beast, seventh head.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And you read the
Declaration of Independence,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying,
hey, the King

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
has done all these
atrocities on the high seas.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.135 align:middle line:84%
And so we're telling
the world why

00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:90%
we're declaring independence.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.620 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was about.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
The Founding Fathers
were trying to break out

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of the grip of the beast
at that-- they were trying

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.115 align:middle line:84%
to do-- what can
you do about it?

00:08:25.115 --> 00:08:27.629 align:middle line:84%
This thing is so huge,
so big, so satanic

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:84%
that it's pretty tough
to get away from it.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.284 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: When we read in
Revelation about the mark

00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:10%
of the beast, the 6-6-6, you
can not buy goods, or services,

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:10%
or anything without that's
mark, what are we talking about

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:10%
there, Ken?

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: OK, well,
it's really interesting,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.114 align:middle line:10%
because there's a second
beast mentioned in Revelation,

00:08:49.114 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:10%
and it's called
the false prophet.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.117 align:middle line:10%
Now people say, well,
that's the pope.

00:08:52.117 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:10%
They make all these
wild speculations.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: That's the
Antichrist, right?

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Well, no,
it's not the Antichrist.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.307 align:middle line:84%
John doesn't even
explain the Antichrist.

00:08:59.307 --> 00:09:01.265 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's mentioned
later in the Epistles.

00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All right,
who's the false prophet?

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: The
false prophet are--

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
it says it looks like a
lamb, speaks like a dragon,

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:90%
and he does three things.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Symbolism, no doubt.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yes, no doubt.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But a horn, in the Bible,
represents a king or a kingdom.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So this false prophet,
the word pseudoprophetes,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
means he gives out
a false message.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Looking like a
lamb is Christ-like looking.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So it has an external
appearance of--

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.605 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So it kind of
tricks you like that.

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: -- Christ,
but inwardly it's not.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:90%
And he has two horns.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about talking
about a man, here.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about two kings, or
two kingdoms that come together

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.040 align:middle line:90%
that do three things.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:90%
It calls down fire from heaven.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, heaven, it's
not coming from God's domain,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.194 align:middle line:84%
it's coming from
the atmospheric air.

00:09:51.194 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.429 align:middle line:84%
But fire from heaven
could be a bomb?

00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: We're talking about
military high-tech, here.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.715 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: It makes an
image that speaks--

00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's a little more
tricky to explain that.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.755 align:middle line:84%
But the third thing is
what you've mentioned.

00:10:02.755 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:84%
It makes a mark without
which no one can buy or sell.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So we know something
about this second beast,

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
which is a code that has some
kind of time component to it.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:84%
That it appears at a time
when technological marvels are

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.132 align:middle line:84%
manifesting, which would
be in the last 100 years.

00:10:21.132 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, exactly.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:90%
And closer now.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Closer now.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So what about this
mark of the beast?

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle line:10%
Now in the 1950s, right after
they figured out computers

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:10%
from the Bletchley
Park thing-- that's

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.220 align:middle line:10%
where the first computers ideas
started to come from-- they

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.729 align:middle line:10%
figured out how to inventory
supermarket products.

00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:10%
And they came up with this thing
called the universal product

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:10%
code.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: The universal
product code--

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: It saved the
supermarket industry.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: It saved.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.045 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
imagine a guy going in

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:52.295 align:middle line:84%
to count all the products
every day, what a nightmare.

00:10:52.295 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Gosh, I used
to remember, Kenny,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I would go grocery
shopping with my mother,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and the cash registers had
the amount of money on it,

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:90%
for the buttons.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, so if it was $1,
or $0.50, so they hit that.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.012 align:middle line:84%
And every item she bought
had to be rung up separately.

00:11:14.012 --> 00:11:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yes, exactly.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know,
sh-ding, sh-ding.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.076 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Right.

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, now it's
just, whoop, right through.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going
to get to the point

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
where we don't even scan
those barcodes anymore.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.660 align:middle line:10%
You'll just take your
basket of groceries,

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:10%
everything will have
a barcode on it,

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:10%
and it'll be done like
that, the whole thing.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Well, this
started out rather benign.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.306 align:middle line:10%
It was just
basically like, let's

00:11:37.306 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:10%
solve this problem
for the supermarket.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, it sounded easy.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.516 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
inventory every day,

00:11:41.516 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
we just know exactly
what was bought and sold.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:10%
And the way that
barcode is set up,

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:10%
and we have a picture
on the screen,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:10%
there's two different
types of bars.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:10%
So there's bars that have
no numbers underneath them,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.690 align:middle line:10%
and they're rather long.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.214 align:middle line:10%
And the other ones are shorter
and they have numbers under.

00:11:57.214 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: They have numbers.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.332 align:middle line:10%
And I've noticed that.

00:11:59.332 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Yeah, but the computer
doesn't understand numeric

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.290 align:middle line:10%
numbers.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.165 align:middle line:10%
It only understands--

00:12:03.165 --> 00:12:03.956 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: The code.

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: -- the
width of those bars.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:10%
And the widths are
different widths, lengths.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And those are, in those lines,
are what we call modules.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're based
upon 1's and 0's.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And so at astronomical
speed, when

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:84%
you put a scanner
across it, it's

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
calculating these
codes at speeds

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
probably faster than
the speed of light.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, there's
two types of codes.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:10%
One that has data information.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:10%
And those are the shorter
bars with the numbers.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:10%
And the longer ones
actually operate

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:10%
the scanner when it goes across.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:10%
And it just tells
the computer, begin

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:10%
to pick up the data
information, now adjust,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:10%
pick up the next information.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:10%
And the last large
long one, shut it off.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.307 align:middle line:90%
So they basically trigger--

00:12:52.307 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And that
includes the price,

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
in there, right?

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: On the left
side of that code,

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:10%
and it's rather uniform,
right here, it's symmetrical,

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.460 align:middle line:10%
is the manufacturer's ID number.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:10%
Let's just say it's Heinz.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: And on
the right side--

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Is the product.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.726 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: -- is the product.

00:13:10.726 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:10%
Ketchup.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: If Heinz has
62 different products,

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:10%
they'd have--

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.974 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Heinz ketchup.

00:13:16.974 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.181 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: OK.

00:13:18.181 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's what that code
was set up to design.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Now try to imagine how
the twistedness of Lucifer

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:84%
could take that and use it to
inventory the whole human race.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.134 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How would he do that?

00:13:34.134 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: What he would do
is, he would use the same

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And instead of having a
manufacturer ID number there,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:84%
he would have, let's
say, the beginning

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.829 align:middle line:90%
of a personal code for you.

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Let's suppose, OK,
every nation of the world has

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.866 align:middle line:90%
a corporate ID number.

00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Separately?

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.615 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Separately.

00:13:56.615 --> 00:14:00.324 align:middle line:10%
Like India has its own ID
number, America is 110.

00:14:00.324 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: And we'd have one.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:10%
So your code would be
like, 110, and then they

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:10%
go right to your area code.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:10%
They would have an area
computer facility in the area.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And mine is 541.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Oregon.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.421 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:17.827 align:middle line:90%
And I would be either 818, or--

00:14:17.827 --> 00:14:19.535 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Yeah, you're
down in southern--

00:14:19.535 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If I'm in
Saint Louis, 314.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.505 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:14:21.505 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And that would be where you're--
so this guy is in 110, 818.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.317 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you know right now
that he's in the United States,

00:14:29.317 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:90%
and he's in southern California.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: He's in Van Nuys.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, he's right
around there, Sherman Oaks.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: We know
where this guy is.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:35.335 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:35.335 --> 00:14:38.475 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: And then you'd
have that middle long bar.

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And it would say,
now we're going

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.317 align:middle line:90%
to get his personal ID number.

00:14:41.317 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:84%
It would be pegged to your
social security number.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: So they give
you all that data.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And now we
know it's George, right?

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.859 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: And now we know it's
George, because we have his--

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and when they want
to track you down,

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:84%
when they do research on you,
they go through your phone

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:90%
number to find you.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.251 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:14:54.251 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: So that's why
the area code is important.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So now all they have
to do is make sure

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:90%
that this is given to everybody.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:10%
Now one thing I forgot
to say, or should say,

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:10%
is that if you look
at this UPC code,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:10%
on the right side
of the code there's

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:10%
some short numbers that
have 6's underneath them.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: 6's?

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: 6's.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:10%
There's two.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:23.880 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Go figure, right?

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.300 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Well, but what's
important to know about them is

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:10%
that they're
basically plus 0 plus.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.489 align:middle line:84%
That's a 6 in the
right side 6's.

00:15:34.489 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.655 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: But if you
look at those two,

00:15:36.655 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:84%
they're the same widths as
the longer computer triggering

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:90%
characters.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So even though there's no
numbers under the longer

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
characters, they're
configured after the number 6.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.525 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there
a 6-6-6 coming here?

00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Well, that's
what I'm saying.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
The long one on the left is a
6, the one in the middle is a 6,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:90%
and the one on the right is a 6.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have three 6's
that you can't see,

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
numbers under it,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.870 align:middle line:84%
but in binary language, which is
pluses and 0's or 1's and 0's,

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:90%
it's the number 6.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now how
bizarre can that be,

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:84%
when Revelation has talked
about the three 6's?

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: It says-- and
it's this false prophet,

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.615 align:middle line:84%
it's not the Antichrist
that does this.

00:16:18.615 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:84%
It's the second
beast that does it.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
great signs that's

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:84%
given to him to do to help
control the world's populous.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How would they
know this in prophecy?

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:90%
I guess they would, huh?

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: I'm not sure he knew.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I think he might have been
told this, or saw this,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:90%
or an angel explained it to him.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.539 align:middle line:10%
But whether he could break
it down the way I'm doing it,

00:16:40.539 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:10%
I doubt that very much,
because they didn't know.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: It was too
technical for them. yeah.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.541 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: It was too technical.

00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:48.751 align:middle line:10%
But it's amazing that the
UPC code is run by three 6's

00:16:48.751 --> 00:16:51.000 align:middle line:10%
that trigger the computer
to pick up data information.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Unbelievable.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So every person
would be given-- now

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
they can take this UPC code now
and shrink it down and put it

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.464 align:middle line:90%
into a chip.

00:17:03.464 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.775 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: And now they have
these things called RFID chips.

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:10.494 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yes, that they
want to implant in us.

00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.990 align:middle line:10%
And what these things do is
they give out a little signal.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:10%
It could even be laser tattooed,
that has a signal in it too,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:10%
or it could be a chip.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:10%
I don't know which
it's going to be.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.260 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that they're
talking about you're not

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.694 align:middle line:84%
being able to have health care
unless you have this chip.

00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or anything.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Or anything.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You won't even be
able to buy or sell.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:31.719 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or bank.

00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Now think about
this for just a minute.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:84%
If you had-- now
think about this-- 91%

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
of all financial
transactions today

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:90%
are with electronic money.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All of them.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.084 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: All but 9%.

00:17:44.084 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Cash is
going out the wayside.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.833 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Out the wayside.

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering
if, how are they

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.651 align:middle line:84%
going to bring this on to
where people will accept it?

00:17:50.651 --> 00:17:52.275 align:middle line:84%
Because there's too
many people like me

00:17:52.275 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
out there that are beginning
to get onto this stuff.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to say,
well, we won't do it.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, they'll be the
first people, probably,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.176 align:middle line:90%
that will be expunged.

00:17:58.176 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, what do
you do when they say one day,

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:90%
you have to have this chip.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to hurt you.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.282 align:middle line:84%
But you can't buy anything,
you can't sell anything.

00:18:07.282 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: And you
can't go to the doctor.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.531 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can't
go to the doctor.

00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:90%
You can't go to the bank.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Now think about this.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.014 align:middle line:84%
Think about all the people
coming across the border

00:18:15.014 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
down there in Texas,
Arizona, New Mexico.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to control people?

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, all you have
to do is give them--

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Chip them.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.268 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: -- chip them.

00:18:24.268 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:90%
And you know exactly who's who.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can cut down
on illegal immigration.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:84%
You can cut down
on the world slave

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
trade of prostituting these
little girls that get caught.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.826 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
all cash business.

00:18:36.826 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: You could
cut down on the--

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, that's a good
thing, getting rid of all that.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: But this
is a way to sell it.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.145 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:43.145 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I see what you mean.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Make it sound good.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.540 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
get people-- by the way,

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.873 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're going to have
a perfect tax system down.

00:18:50.873 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:90%
We know how to tax you exactly.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of
the counterfeiting

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:90%
trade, which is huge.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of so many
things that are criminal,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:84%
because you have a system,
now, that can be imposed,

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:84%
where we know
everything about you.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you have to
give up some freedom,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.016 align:middle line:84%
but we can get rid
of a lot of crime.

00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:90%
We can control the borders.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.848 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And if we
don't know about you,

00:19:11.848 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
these people can't
function in society.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.438 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: That's right.

00:19:14.438 --> 00:19:16.520 align:middle line:90%
And think about the terrorists.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.665 align:middle line:90%
They function on cash.

00:19:17.665 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: I mean, the people
that took out the World Trade

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.599 align:middle line:84%
Center, at least from
what we can see--

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: From what we can see.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah, used cash.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:90%
That's how they did it.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Well, no more cash.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We'll know exactly
who-- who's who.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
You won't have to go through
the electronic machine

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:90%
at the airport anymore.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:90%
What a pain.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So let's assume
all this is correct,

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
this is all real, you've
read this correctly.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.800 align:middle line:90%
You've interpreted it correctly.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Where is that taking
us with Lucifer?

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Well.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.975 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where's
the connection?

00:19:52.975 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: His plan is
to control the world.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what-- That everything
would be-- It's almost

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:84%
like he's the
pharaoh of the world,

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that he wants to be the
grand poo-bah of it all.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And he needs
this technology to do it?

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Yeah, he
needs three things.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
He needs to make a play for
the world's money, which

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:90%
this would do.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:84%
This system would
eliminate money,

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:84%
it will eliminate
gold and silver,

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:90%
it will eliminate currency.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:84%
This is electronic money
that's all trackable.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
They know every financial
transaction you made,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.860 align:middle line:90%
then perfectly tax you.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the perfect system to
control things economically.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.480 align:middle line:90%
No more fiat currencies.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Every nation now is
manipulating their currency.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a race to the bottom.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And there will be an
end to fiat currencies.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Now whether this
comes on immediately,

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:84%
or whether there's
a new world currency

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.697 align:middle line:84%
after the Chinese money, or the
Russian money, I don't know.

00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:10%
I don't know the answer to that.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:10%
It's like, that's an
academic question.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Or whether it's plunges us into
a depression where they come up

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.879 align:middle line:84%
with this whole idea that they
already know about, you know,

00:20:57.879 --> 00:21:00.635 align:middle line:84%
out of chaos comes order, that's
their whole plan, I don't know.

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:90%
We'll have to wait and see.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.010 align:middle line:84%
But I predict there's going
to be a depression and a world

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:90%
banking collapse.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.946 align:middle line:90%
And it could happen shortly.

00:21:05.946 --> 00:21:07.294 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:21:07.294 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right, there.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Yeah, I think
it could happen shortly.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.260 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: All
signs of the devil?

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Yeah, all signs of the
devil, a manipulator of mammon,

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.905 align:middle line:84%
which is the riches
of this world.

00:21:18.905 --> 00:21:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And it goes all the way
back to the Bank of England

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that set the whole
concept of fiat currency.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.057 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What
does Lucifer want?

00:21:25.057 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:90%
What's the end game?

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: He wants
to be worshipped.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
He wants to supplant worship
from the true God to himself.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.209 align:middle line:84%
And that way, prove
that, part of how

00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:84%
he would prove in
the appellate court

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't do
anything to wrong.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is God going
to let this happen?

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: It's going
to proliferate.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:90%
It's going to get really bad.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.425 align:middle line:84%
And only the coming of Christ
is going to stop anything.

00:21:47.425 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And it can't be
stopped by humans.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How will we know
if there's a Second Coming,

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:90%
who that is and that it's real?

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Well, there,
I think in my studies,

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
that there has to be a
third Jewish temple built.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
A third Jewish temple
has to be built.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:08.928 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In Jerusalem?

00:22:08.928 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: In Jerusalem.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Now whether the Jews force
it to be on the Temple Mount,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.860 align:middle line:84%
which is possible, or whether
they buy, what I'm saying--

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, they're not going
to knock down the Temple Mount,

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.560 align:middle line:90%
To build a third one?

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Or would they?

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Who knows?

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:90%
They're getting pretty violent.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look what
they're doing just today.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:29.404 align:middle line:84%
They're probably invading
Gaza as I'm speaking.

00:22:29.404 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
They're getting to the
point where they're not

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.191 align:middle line:84%
going to be pushed around by
the United States not supporting

00:22:34.191 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
They're just taking things
into their own hands.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they're going to do.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.600 align:middle line:90%
This remains to be seen.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.516 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Nobody does.

00:22:39.516 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: Or whether they
accept the fact that the temple

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.777 align:middle line:10%
doesn't go where they think, and
it goes on the southeast ridge.

00:22:44.777 --> 00:22:47.026 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you believe
it should go someplace else?

00:22:47.026 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Southeast ridge
is where it belongs,

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:90%
right over the Gihon Springs.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
My film, this film that I
just shot there, proves it,

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I think, beyond a
shadow of a doubt.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How big would a
temple like this have to be?

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.929 align:middle line:90%
Huge?

00:22:58.929 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Well, no.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, the actual
dimensions of it

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
are-- I can't remember
the actual cubits--

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:84%
but it would fit on that
southeast ridge, which

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.739 align:middle line:90%
is only about 600 feet across.

00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And what would the significance
of building a third temple be?

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Because the
Romans destroyed it in 70.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And they've been lamenting over
this for thousands of years.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And they think, well,
we're not quite home yet

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:90%
until our temple's back.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They haven't
had one since 70 AD?

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: That's right.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.343 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:23:33.343 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: And there's a
lot of explanation for why

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:90%
that's been.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.965 align:middle line:84%
But they were thrown into the
wilderness of the Gentiles,

00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:40.410 align:middle line:90%
as explained in the prophets.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the Jews were
dispersed over all the planet.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
They started coming back at
the turn of last century.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1948, you know,
Israel was born in a day.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's been nothing but
this two-state idea for Israel,

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.456 align:middle line:84%
which is the official
policy of the United

00:23:56.456 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:90%
States and the world.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.167 align:middle line:90%
But it's wrong.

00:23:58.167 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All right, so let's
say the temple gets built.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.195 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:24:01.195 --> 00:24:03.611 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A lot of people who
deal with prophecy are going

00:24:03.611 --> 00:24:05.060 align:middle line:90%
to go crazy, aren't they?

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yes.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.790 align:middle line:90%
But that temple will be defiled.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember,
Lucifer's judgment

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.340 align:middle line:90%
was to vacate his angel body.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And he'll be forced
into a human body.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Now that sounds like
transcendental and wild.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So a human will
literally be Lucifer?

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yes.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.980 align:middle line:84%
There will be a
physical manifestation

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:84%
of Lucifer controlling
a human body.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.031 align:middle line:84%
And he will go into
that rebuilt temple.

00:24:33.031 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Will we
know it's Lucifer?

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: If you're listening
to this broadcast, you will.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You will.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.560 align:middle line:10%
But if you're not?

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.393 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: If you're
not, you might not know.

00:24:40.393 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And he'll proclaim
himself to be God.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And Paul, the epistle
of Thessalonians,

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:84%
he wrote that he'll going
to the temple of God,

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.470 align:middle line:84%
which means it
has to be rebuilt,

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.450 align:middle line:90%
proclaiming himself to be God.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And that will be
like, OK, that's it.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Now things are really
going to get nasty.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So this
human-type devil--

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yes.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: -- will
proclaim to be God.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: That's right.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I would guess right
now, Ken-- in the temple--

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I would guess, right, that
if anybody stood up and said,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:13.593 align:middle line:84%
I'm God, people would say, uh,
he needs to be taken to a home

00:25:13.593 --> 00:25:14.615 align:middle line:90%
for the insane.

00:25:14.615 --> 00:25:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right?

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Won't they do that?

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:17.994 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: I would think so.

00:25:17.994 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:10%
But I don't know how this
is all going to play.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:10%
But I know there
has to be a temple,

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:10%
and I know there has to be
a defiling of that temple

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:10%
by the Antichrist, because
Satan, Lucifer, has

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:10%
to eventually take
on a human body.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the judgment.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Will you know if this
happens during your lifetime,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.092 align:middle line:90%
that that's Lucifer?

00:25:37.092 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: There's a good chance
that that'll-- it'll happen

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:90%
in my lifetime.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But who knows when the Jews
are going to come around

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.072 align:middle line:90%
to putting that temple up there?

00:25:45.072 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Without the
temple, not gonna happen.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Not gonna happen.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: That's
why it's important.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Now the book of Ezekiel
talks about a temple, too.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
it's the same temple

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:84%
that Revelation
is talking about.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.610 align:middle line:84%
The Revelation temple is
the one Lucifer, Satan,

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:90%
as the Antichrist goes into.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.819 align:middle line:90%
That's the Revelation temple.

00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:08.151 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You've come a long
way since you were catching

00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:84%
footballs, when it
comes to this, huh?

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Listen, man, I
don't-- I mean, it's been agony.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, football was
tortuous physically.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.650 align:middle line:84%
This has been tortuous mentally,
to go through all of this,

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:90%
to put this all together.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:20.940 align:middle line:90%
But it's been worth it all.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.193 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could you be wrong
in any of your subjective

00:26:25.193 --> 00:26:25.693 align:middle line:90%
hypotheses?

00:26:25.693 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: Well, you know,
religious people don't want

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.585 align:middle line:90%
to admit they're ever wrong.

00:26:34.585 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
why we have dogma.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.376 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
false doctrine.

00:26:37.376 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people today
think that Jesus

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
is going to walk through the
Eastern Gate of the Haram.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.524 align:middle line:84%
And I go, try to
tell them about where

00:26:46.524 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I think the temple
is going to go,

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say
I'm an antichrist,

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.809 align:middle line:90%
or I'm a false prophet.

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They'll
say that about you?

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Oh, yeah.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:90%
They won't back off from the--

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm sitting
with the Antichrist?

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: No, no.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
They will make
all-- I have caught

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.500 align:middle line:90%
more heat for what I say.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's a good sign that
I'm on the right track.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.424 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you slip a
RFID chip in me, or anything?

00:27:06.424 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: I don't think there's
any question there's going

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:84%
to be a mark of the beast that's
based upon the UPC code that is

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.740 align:middle line:84%
shrunk down to either a
tattoo that gives off--

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I think
you're absolutely right.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.115 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Yeah.

00:27:18.115 --> 00:27:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't see how you
can change that.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The question
is, can we fight it,

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:90%
or do we have to accept it?

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of people
say, I'm not going to take it.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.320 align:middle line:84%
How many people have taken
a social security number,

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.222 align:middle line:84%
because without it
you can't get a job.

00:27:32.222 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: That's right.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.388 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You can't function.

00:27:34.388 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: That's right.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're going
to do the same thing.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say folks,
here's the new technology.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.088 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: You know the thing
of it is, it's all about like,

00:27:43.088 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:90%
what are you willing to die for?

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:46.711 align:middle line:90%
What do you believe?

00:27:46.711 --> 00:27:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I look at the guys that
fought in World War II, man,

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.189 align:middle line:90%
they're my heroes.

00:27:50.189 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I went to Arlington Cemetery
and I looked at these guys

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.962 align:middle line:84%
that, 18, 19, 20 years
old, that laid down

00:27:54.962 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:84%
their life so I
could have freedom.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.555 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, these guys
believed in America.

00:27:58.555 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: My dad
was one of them.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.454 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: And my dad
fought in World War II.

00:28:02.454 --> 00:28:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And I look at these
guys and went,

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:84%
we don't respect
their sacrifice.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And like, so what
am I willing to put

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:90%
on the line for what I believe?

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes down to this,
it's about life and death.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't think someone
is going to give up their life

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:90%
to oppose an RFID chip.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: There's probably a
lot of people that will take it.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:90%
I, for one, am ready to go.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.016 align:middle line:84%
I've made my peace with--
like Gary Sinese did in--

00:28:28.016 --> 00:28:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You won't--
you want take it?

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.880 align:middle line:90%
You won't take the chip?

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: No way.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:84%
You can take off my head, like
the Arabs do with, you know,

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.110 align:middle line:84%
the Shiites that
they're killing down.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going that route.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.555 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really
the line in the sand.

00:28:40.555 --> 00:28:42.180 align:middle line:10%
That's the line in
the sand, that we'll

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.380 align:middle line:10%
know who's who based
upon that decision.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.910 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's coming
pretty soon, especially

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:52.785 align:middle line:10%
if we see, as Legard says,
a new world currency reset.

00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.620 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to see that too.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Ken, if people want
more information

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:84%
on what you do, how
do they find you?

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:10%
>> KLEIN: They can go to my
website, kenklein-- k-l-e-i-n--

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:05.440 align:middle line:10%
productions-- plural,
productions.net.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I think if you Google my name,
I'm all over the internet,

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:90%
k-l-e-i-n.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.782 align:middle line:84%
Ken Klein I think,
click on there,

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and it will take you
right to my website.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm going to
watch things unfold.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see
how right you are.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>> KLEIN: OK,
that's fair enough.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right, thank you.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Ken Klein.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>> KLEIN: Thanks, so much.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.598 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This has been another
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:29:20.598 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, it
