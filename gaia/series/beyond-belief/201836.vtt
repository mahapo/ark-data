>>GEORGE NOORY: Today
on "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.445 align:middle line:84%
we have one of the
world's leading paranormal

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.573 align:middle line:84%
investigators, a dear
friend, Joshua P. Warren.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
In the field and the lab,
he experiments with methods

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.038 align:middle line:84%
to attract and manifest
all kinds of things.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, he has
manifested some strange things,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.254 align:middle line:84%
including paranormal phenomena
and even good fortune.

00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:47.256 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
he did it for me.

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:49.424 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you that story
later on in the program.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.426 align:middle line:84%
Josh, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.011 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSHUA P. WARREN: It's always
wonderful to be with you.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, George.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:56.306 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I've been
doing very well.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:57.516 align:middle line:90%
I've been staying busy--

00:00:57.516 --> 00:01:00.102 align:middle line:84%
lots of new projects,
lots of experiments.

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:02.437 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
the world is just

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
becoming more and more
intrigued and fascinated

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.858 align:middle line:84%
by the paranormal and the
metaphysical every day.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:08.986 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are based on
Las Vegas, though, right?

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:10.153 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes, I am.

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:10.946 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Museum?

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:11.738 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Well, no.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.032 align:middle line:84%
I don't have my museum in
Asheville, North Carolina

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:14.825 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.035 align:middle line:84%
We had to shut that down
because the building had

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:17.828 align:middle line:90%
to be renovated.

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, and you did
not move that to Vegas?

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.789 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I moved all
my stuff to Vegas,

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.875 align:middle line:84%
and so I'm planning on
opening a museum in Vegas.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a little ahead
of the game here, aren't you?

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:27.545 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes, that's right.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.298 align:middle line:84%
As soon as everything
is in place,

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:32.801 align:middle line:84%
then I'd like to open a
museum and a show laboratory

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:35.178 align:middle line:84%
where people can come
in and I can demonstrate

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.515 align:middle line:84%
some of the experiments that
I talk about on your show

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.058 align:middle line:90%
and in so many other places.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:43.061 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going to talk
about invisibility cloaking.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:48.608 align:middle line:84%
But before we do, you
sketched for me a sigil.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:53.989 align:middle line:84%
Explain what that is and why you
wanted me to keep it on myself.

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.491 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: A sigil
is a magical symbol,

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.411 align:middle line:84%
and these have been used by
various cultures for thousands

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:00.287 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.622 align:middle line:84%
The symbol is almost
like an antenna

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.876 align:middle line:84%
to attract a certain
type of energy.

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:10.255 align:middle line:84%
And I created a technique
called Para-Cymatics in which we

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:13.091 align:middle line:90%
create sigils using water.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.761 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I take a
message, something

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.721 align:middle line:84%
like "I want to
attract more money"

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.515 align:middle line:84%
or "I want to attract
a ghost" or "I want

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.809 align:middle line:90%
to attract more vivid dreams."

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.771 align:middle line:84%
And I play that message
along with a tone

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.189 align:middle line:90%
in a cylinder of water.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:27.981 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.108 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It creates
patterns in the water,

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:33.403 align:middle line:84%
and I view those patterns
with lasers, infrared lights,

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:90%
ultraviolet lights.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.325 align:middle line:84%
And then I extract the
pattern it makes in the water

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.327 align:middle line:90%
and illustrate that as a symbol.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.037 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You take a
picture or something?

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.454 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I take
a picture of it.

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:46.541 align:middle line:84%
And then I put them on
my website for free,

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.837 align:middle line:84%
and I tell people, go print it
out, download it, just expose

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.299 align:middle line:84%
yourself to it throughout the
day, and see what happens.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.218 align:middle line:84%
And I get the most
incredible stories

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:59.304 align:middle line:84%
from people telling me that
it has worked attracting

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.515 align:middle line:90%
everything you can imagine.

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.016 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there
are people getting

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.227 align:middle line:84%
these sigils tattooed
on themselves

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.436 align:middle line:90%
because they're so effective.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.438 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're wild
patterns, aren't they?

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.148 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah,
they're very abstract,

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:12.943 align:middle line:84%
but they are taken from
whatever mother nature showed us

00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:13.735 align:middle line:90%
in the water.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:14.027 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.906 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: So you were one of
my first experimental subjects.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.908 align:middle line:84%
I wondered what would
happen if we actually took

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.744 align:middle line:84%
your name and a picture
of you and turned it

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:26.832 align:middle line:84%
into a symbol of you to
reinforce your own energy.

00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:28.959 align:middle line:84%
Now, you said you've been
using this sigil, right?

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:29.793 align:middle line:84%
So what's been
happening for you?

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.169 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Things have been great.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.797 align:middle line:84%
I've had it for about
a year now from you.

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:39.261 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to say I made
a million dollar sort of thing,

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:40.637 align:middle line:90%
but, I mean, I'm doing OK.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.974 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, invisibility
cloaking, what is that?

00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:46.977 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, for 28 years,
I have traveled the world

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:50.689 align:middle line:84%
exploring strange things,
and I always hear people say,

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.315 align:middle line:84%
I've got to see
it to believe it.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.233 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.819 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: The problem is
you hear people saying,

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.155 align:middle line:84%
I saw a ghost then
it disappeared.

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:00.407 align:middle line:90%
I saw a UFO then it disappeared.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.784 align:middle line:84%
I saw Bigfoot then
he disappeared.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.328 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of frustrating
to study something that's

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:90%
disappearing all the time.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.581 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: But I wondered, what
if these things, as people

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.211 align:middle line:84%
often suggest, are
not disappearing

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:17.632 align:middle line:84%
into another realm or another
place or another location?

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
What if they're simply
becoming invisible?

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.808 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, I started to
study just how difficult it

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.352 align:middle line:90%
is to achieve invisibility.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.939 align:middle line:84%
I started looking into
invisibility tech--

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.609 align:middle line:84%
very practical things that
we humans have access to.

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.611 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Josh, you
sent us a video showing

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.571 align:middle line:90%
us invisibility cloaking.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.574 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more about
what we're looking at.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.992 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Now here,
of course, you

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:47.704 align:middle line:84%
don't see anything too
distinctive, but guess what?

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.081 align:middle line:90%
There is a little ghost there.

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:55.003 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And this is just
on a tray in my living room.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.839 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, as
we look from above,

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.925 align:middle line:84%
that that ghost
is just surrounded

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:03.678 align:middle line:84%
by some of this very
basic cloaking material

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.223 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to easily
and very affordably get

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:07.015 align:middle line:90%
my hands on.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:07.849 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's really cool.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: They go there, yeah.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.561 align:middle line:84%
There's a little flying
saucer hiding out there.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.773 align:middle line:84%
I think the next one is maybe
a little more impressive

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:17.901 align:middle line:84%
because you don't really
see much distinct there,

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:22.948 align:middle line:84%
but here we have a big ole furry
hulking Bigfoot standing there.

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.158 align:middle line:84%
But, hey, enough of
these little dolls.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.244 align:middle line:90%
That's just for example.

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:28.078 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.621 align:middle line:84%
You don't see
anything notable here.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.498 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: But guess what?

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah?

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.124 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's me.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.877 align:middle line:84%
I hid my entire self, my
whole body behind a piece

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.462 align:middle line:90%
of this cloaking material.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:41.007 align:middle line:84%
And to really prove the
point, I went to a busy bar

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.635 align:middle line:84%
on a Saturday
night in Las Vegas,

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.804 align:middle line:84%
sat right there with people
walking back and forth.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:46.763 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are you?

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.139 align:middle line:90%
I don't see you.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.391 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: And guess what?

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:52.435 align:middle line:84%
The whole time I'm
sitting right there--

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.311 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.189 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: --behind one of these
pieces of invisibility cloaking

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:90%
material.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.984 align:middle line:90%
That is a passive material.

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:03.113 align:middle line:84%
It's very affordable, and it's
surprisingly easy to obtain.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what about
advanced technology?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.866 align:middle line:90%
This was in a very simple term.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:07.701 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yes.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.996 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about if
it's just really advanced?

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:12.122 align:middle line:90%
What can you do with it?

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.915 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, you
see, people, they often

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:18.253 align:middle line:84%
think the invisibility
concept is something fanciful.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.005 align:middle line:90%
They roll their eyes at it.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:23.341 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm showing you right
here that it's actually

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.885 align:middle line:84%
incredibly easy to make
something invisible.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.304 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
almost child's play.

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:28.305 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: It really is.

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:31.182 align:middle line:84%
You could practically
create a toy out of it.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:34.728 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have got
these military officials

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:38.440 align:middle line:84%
out there who are focusing
on invisibility tech

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.943 align:middle line:84%
and spending millions
and millions of dollars,

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:44.446 align:middle line:84%
I believe they have
created invisibility

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.823 align:middle line:84%
that is crystal
clear, transparent.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:51.119 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in what I showed you,
it had that blurry predator kind

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.413 align:middle line:90%
of mirage look.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:58.376 align:middle line:84%
But if you talk about the
military making soldiers

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:03.048 align:middle line:84%
and making craft invisible,
that may sound so far-fetched.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:04.132 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't seem possible.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:08.261 align:middle line:84%
But if I say, OK, well, let's
substitute the word camouflage

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.137 align:middle line:90%
instead.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you realize,
this is a fundamental part

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.725 align:middle line:90%
of military technology.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:16.936 align:middle line:84%
It's camouflage, blending
in, and I have no doubt

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that we have
technology out there

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.066 align:middle line:84%
that can put a human
being in your living room

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.942 align:middle line:84%
and you'll never know
that person's is there

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.487 align:middle line:84%
or can definitely fly
craft overhead that you

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.488 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be able to see.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:29.449 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Josh, this reminds me
of the Philadelphia experiment,

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.912 align:middle line:84%
where the navy wanted a
ship to simply disappear.

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:37.165 align:middle line:84%
And you've heard the horrendous
story tied into that.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:37.999 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.417 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It's
certainly possible.

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:40.877 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one
of those stories

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.212 align:middle line:90%
that is still up for debate.

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:43.004 align:middle line:90%
It's anecdotal.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:46.299 align:middle line:84%
But the theory is that
they were able to use

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.468 align:middle line:84%
Tesla coils and
similar technology

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.929 align:middle line:84%
to resonate the molecular
structure of the ship.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something magnetic?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.099 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: They used a
lot of different fields,

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.267 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
resonance, in order

00:07:56.267 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
to almost liquefy the
solid structure of the ship

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.777 align:middle line:84%
momentarily to remove
it from its place

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.821 align:middle line:84%
in the visible
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.656 align:middle line:84%
And they claim that
when they did that,

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
because it was in that
fluid sort of state,

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.453 align:middle line:84%
that when everything snapped
back into a solid state,

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.831 align:middle line:84%
some of the soldiers had
gotten a little too close.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Half and half.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.998 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.251 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And their bodies
were melded right in there.

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's right.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.547 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies were merged
with an animal material.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.257 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
UFO videographer named

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Steve Barone, and he captured a
UFO using cloaking technology.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: He sure did.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.308 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
this amazing image.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.018 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it's
funny because you're

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:90%
looking at an invisible craft.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.981 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] So look at
those three lights, George.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.608 align:middle line:84%
That's all you can really
see are the three lights

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.736 align:middle line:90%
on the tip of this craft.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:52.699 align:middle line:84%
This is a triangular craft that
is landing at Nellis Air Force

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:53.867 align:middle line:90%
Base in Las Vegas.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:54.951 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.411 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And you
can see, again,

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.663 align:middle line:84%
it's not crystal
clear because there

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.915 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of
distortion as you

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.835 align:middle line:90%
look at the lights behind it.

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.546 align:middle line:84%
But you can clearly
see those three lights

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.299 align:middle line:84%
on the wingtips blinking
and everything below it.

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:12.969 align:middle line:84%
And if those lights were
not blinking on the tips,

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.471 align:middle line:84%
you would never
notice that thing.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.139 align:middle line:84%
If it flew right over
your head at night,

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:17.265 align:middle line:90%
you just see the stars.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:19.893 align:middle line:84%
So I believe there's
no doubt this

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:24.147 align:middle line:84%
is man-made artificial
military technology being

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.857 align:middle line:90%
used to cloak a craft.

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:26.649 align:middle line:90%
And it's possible.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:27.567 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Our crafts.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.985 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I believe,
in this case,

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.112 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
a human craft.

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.865 align:middle line:84%
But it makes you
wonder, did they

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:36.451 align:middle line:84%
back-engineer that
level of invisibility

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:40.955 align:middle line:84%
from aliens and exotic craft
or is this just something

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.832 align:middle line:90%
we developed on our own?

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
Steve Barone, who

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.255 align:middle line:84%
lives on this cliff in Las Vegas
overlooking the whole valley,

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:53.968 align:middle line:84%
he has filmed a lot of UFOs
that are obviously alien

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:57.472 align:middle line:84%
as well as things in the
neighborhood that are obviously

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.557 align:middle line:90%
advanced military.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:02.769 align:middle line:84%
So there's some overlap
there between what we're

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:84%
doing with our current
human technology

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.817 align:middle line:84%
and what we have
learned from the aliens

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:12.403 align:middle line:84%
or how those two
inspire each other.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:14.864 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the aliens are just
interested in what we do,

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.325 align:middle line:84%
and we're interested in what
they do, and we crossed paths.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
have we been looking

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.245 align:middle line:90%
for cloaking technology?

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:22.247 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, really,
since the very beginning

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.958 align:middle line:84%
of the concept of
camouflage itself.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.334 align:middle line:90%
That's what it all is about.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:29.295 align:middle line:84%
It's just trying to blend
in and become unnoticed.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:33.591 align:middle line:84%
What makes this new level
of technology so unnerving

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:37.428 align:middle line:84%
is that I did this
experiment at my house

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.389 align:middle line:84%
where I took that
cloaking material

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.015 align:middle line:84%
and I wrapped it
around myself so

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.308 align:middle line:90%
that I was virtually invisible.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
develop that material?

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:44.978 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: I did not.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:90%
I obtained it.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.896 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.732 align:middle line:84%
The material is designed
in a special way

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:53.319 align:middle line:84%
to reflect light at
many different angles.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a little
hesitant to tell people

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.282 align:middle line:84%
exactly how to get
their hands on it

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
because you can
see how easily this

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:90%
could be abused by a criminal.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.494 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.621 align:middle line:84%
You walk into a bank
or anything else

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.164 align:middle line:84%
with this thing
wrapped around you?

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.541 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Oh,
there's no telling.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:10.962 align:middle line:84%
And I found that when I put
this thing around myself,

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I had an infrared motion
detector for an alarm system

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.847 align:middle line:84%
at my house and I walked past
it, it did not set it off.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So this not only
makes you invisible.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.812 align:middle line:84%
It will shield you against
a lot of the technology that

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:31.482 align:middle line:84%
is used to detect the
presence of a physical human.

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:34.611 align:middle line:84%
Think about how dangerous
that could be if it

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:35.778 align:middle line:90%
fell into the wrong hands.

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:36.738 align:middle line:90%
It makes me shudder.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:41.492 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when we talk about
spirits that we cannot see,

00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.829 align:middle line:84%
that they're invisible, are they
using this kind of technology

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.706 align:middle line:90%
in the spirit world?

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I don't
think that spirits are

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.628 align:middle line:90%
using this technology per se.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:55.089 align:middle line:84%
What I think, however, is that
this technology illustrates

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:59.093 align:middle line:84%
for us that the
concept of invisibility

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:03.348 align:middle line:84%
is not as rare or difficult
to achieve as we thought.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.767 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't
know the mechanism

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:09.062 align:middle line:84%
by which these spiritual
and paranormal things become

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:13.316 align:middle line:84%
invisible or are
affected to be invisible,

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:16.069 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a
big stretch for us

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:21.157 align:middle line:84%
anymore to overcome
that sort of obstacle.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.201 align:middle line:84%
How could something
appear and then disappear?

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.244 align:middle line:84%
We already know that
that's not a big deal,

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:28.373 align:middle line:84%
so we can move the
conversation past that point.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.749 align:middle line:90%
How they do it?

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.961 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's probably in a
much more sophisticated way.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.463 align:middle line:84%
But in general, really,
all that matters

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.383 align:middle line:84%
is that we manipulate the
way the human eyes are

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:39.759 align:middle line:84%
able to perceive
the environment.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.678 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Josh, tell us
a little bit about what

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:42.762 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at now.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:47.266 align:middle line:84%
Daniel Hurst in North Carolina
took some video of something

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.226 align:middle line:90%
in the spirit world.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Very strange.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.853 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Daniel Hurst
is a friend of mine,

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.814 align:middle line:84%
and he is a paranormal
investigator.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.983 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of my
favorite pieces of footage

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.776 align:middle line:90%
that's come out recently.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.404 align:middle line:84%
He went to a house
that was being haunted

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:03.116 align:middle line:84%
by an elderly woman, and
she would walk around

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.909 align:middle line:84%
on the floor at
night to stop around.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.787 align:middle line:84%
Look at her footsteps
here on the floor.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.789 align:middle line:84%
You'll see at
replay here, there's

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:13.292 align:middle line:84%
sort of a white light that
swoops down to the right.

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:16.796 align:middle line:84%
And after that white light,
look, you'll see one step--

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.715 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is not
trick photography, is it?

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:21.175 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: -three step, almost
four steps right there.

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:22.552 align:middle line:90%
This is not trick photography.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:23.344 align:middle line:90%
I know Daniel.

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:24.971 align:middle line:90%
He's a graduate of my classes.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.139 align:middle line:90%
I've investigated with him.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.306 align:middle line:90%
Look again.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:30.518 align:middle line:90%
We have step, step, step.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:33.021 align:middle line:90%
Now, you see, she's there.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.106 align:middle line:84%
She's in the room,
but you can't see her.

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:35.982 align:middle line:90%
She's invisible.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.233 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a person?

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.317 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: It's a spirit.

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:38.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A spirit.

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:39.027 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.069 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: So she's there.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:46.117 align:middle line:84%
You can see her footsteps,
but she is actually invisible.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:52.331 align:middle line:84%
Now, these invisible forces,
they also have physical force.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.165 align:middle line:90%
So look at this.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:54.792 align:middle line:84%
This is from Asheville,
North Carolina.

00:13:54.792 --> 00:14:00.173 align:middle line:84%
This is a door of a haunted
bar that swung open at 8:30

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:00.965 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:01.716 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's nobody there?

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:01.966 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: No.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:02.759 align:middle line:90%
It was locked.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.926 align:middle line:90%
It set off the alarm system.

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:05.845 align:middle line:84%
It had a big metal
bar on the outside

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.222 align:middle line:84%
to prevent anybody from
accessing it from the outside.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that was
captured by their--

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:10.933 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: By their
security system.

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:11.768 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By their
security cameras.

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.895 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: So we have
evidence in those two clips

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:17.315 align:middle line:84%
that you have these paranormal
entities that are invisible.

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're
right there in the room,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.777 align:middle line:84%
you can see their
footsteps and how

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.278 align:middle line:90%
they affect the environment.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:25.448 align:middle line:84%
And also, they can
have physical force.

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.867 align:middle line:84%
How much force does
it take to push open

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:84%
that big old door in that bar
by pressing on the crash bar?

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.123 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
these entities

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:90%
that are physically present.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:90%
They have physical force.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.921 align:middle line:90%
They're just invisible.

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.007 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we being observed
by these spirits and we

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:44.342 align:middle line:90%
don't even know it?

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:47.553 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I believe that we
are being observed all the time

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:51.099 align:middle line:84%
by spirits and other beings
that we would usually

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.226 align:middle line:90%
consider interdimensional.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:56.187 align:middle line:84%
There is no reason whatsoever
to think scientifically

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that life must exist
exclusively within this range

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.944 align:middle line:84%
that you and I call physical--
that is physical to us.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Physicality is a relative thing.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.992 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, we see how
giant and vast and complex

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.578 align:middle line:90%
the observable universe is.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.497 align:middle line:84%
Within all that,
scientists tell us there

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:17.667 align:middle line:84%
are at least 10 or
11 dimensions which

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.752 align:middle line:90%
we can barely even comprehend.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.421 align:middle line:84%
And it's, I think, safe to think
that many of those dimensions

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:25.675 align:middle line:84%
would have other forms of life
that are capable of observing

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:29.887 align:middle line:84%
us sometimes just like we are
sometimes capable of observing

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.347 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:33.141 align:middle line:84%
And during that
overlap period is

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.768 align:middle line:84%
when we say we've had a
paranormal encounter, when

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.728 align:middle line:84%
we get a glimpse of
a ghost or a Bigfoot

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:39.438 align:middle line:84%
or an alien or one
of these other things

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:42.817 align:middle line:84%
that defies any
ordinary description.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.819 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
rice-thought experiment?

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.863 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take
a look at it in a second,

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:47.655 align:middle line:90%
but what is that?

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, of course,
you and I are spirits.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.785 align:middle line:90%
We just happen to have a body.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.662 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
spirit, that means

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:90%
you're able to direct thought.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.334 align:middle line:84%
And we forget that a
lot because thoughts

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:03.004 align:middle line:90%
are invisible intrinsically.

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.046 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Supposed to be.

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:04.839 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.507 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the
direct thought,

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:10.803 align:middle line:84%
but you do see the outcome
of thought applied over time.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I did a very
simple experiment.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.433 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard about this, but
I wanted to see for myself,

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:90%
where I took three jars of rice.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.146 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just regular rice.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Regular, yeah.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.982 align:middle line:90%
Uncle Ben's white rice.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's mainly water and
air, so it's a great subject

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.446 align:middle line:90%
similar to a human body.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.615 align:middle line:84%
Human bodies are
mainly water and air.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.825 align:middle line:84%
One jar, I wrote the
word "love" on it.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:84%
The other jar, I
wrote the word "hate."

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.038 align:middle line:84%
The other jar, I just
wrote the word "ignore."

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.457 align:middle line:84%
And for two months,
I would consistently

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:84%
say positive things to the
love jar and negative things

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.878 align:middle line:90%
to the hate jar.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:47.506 align:middle line:84%
And even though you couldn't
see the thoughts coming out

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:52.637 align:middle line:84%
of my head, these thoughts
had a visible physical impact

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
on these things
after two months.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at your experiment.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.933 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:56.933 --> 00:17:00.353 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: This jar says
"love," this jar says

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
"hate," and this
jar says "ignore."

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.487 align:middle line:84%
A scoop of rice, out
it in the love jar,

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:15.284 align:middle line:84%
put it in the hate jar,
put it into the ignore jar.

00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:16.577 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:90%
Next jar, this is the hate jar.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:23.084 align:middle line:90%
You disappointing piece of--

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.377 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with the love jar.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.685 align:middle line:90%
Looks pretty good.

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.436 align:middle line:90%
So this is the hate jar.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:90%
This is much more brown.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.618 align:middle line:90%
The ignore jar.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:06.377 align:middle line:90%
This is the love jar.

00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:08.921 align:middle line:90%
This is the hate jar.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:12.174 align:middle line:90%
This is the ignore jar.

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:84%
The jar that has "love"
on it, after two months,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.936 align:middle line:84%
has the healthiest
looking white fluffy rice.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:24.937 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty weird.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.813 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:26.814 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing, Josh.

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:28.941 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to you about
that in just a moment.

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.485 align:middle line:84%
But this reminds me
of the experiments

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:35.156 align:middle line:84%
of the late Dr. Emoto, who
experimented with water.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:40.369 align:middle line:84%
And what he did is he would have
some water, he would freeze it,

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
but before he froze it
and took a sample of it

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.207 align:middle line:84%
and looked under
a microscope, he

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:49.045 align:middle line:84%
would bombard it with
beautiful soft music

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:90%
or really harsh music.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.218 align:middle line:84%
And every time he froze the
water crystals, looked at it

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.637 align:middle line:84%
under a microscope,
the water that

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:84%
had been bombarded with
pleasant sweet music,

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.728 align:middle line:84%
as we would call it, the
crystals looked gorgeous.

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But the harsh music, bombarding
with this high energy

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.611 align:middle line:84%
rat-tat-tat, they were
all discombobulated.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:14.904 align:middle line:90%
They looked horrible.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:90%
They looked horrible.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.698 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:20.618 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, I think it's
exactly like what we're seeing

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:24.663 align:middle line:84%
here in the rice experiment,
that when you produce--

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:25.498 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Intention.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:30.878 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: -yeah, harmonious,
loving, peaceful thoughts,

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:34.131 align:middle line:90%
it produces an abundance.

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:39.887 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you can see what
Dr. Emoto was doing with water

00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:41.639 align:middle line:84%
and what I've done
with Para-Cymatics.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.849 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar in
a way because when

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:47.895 align:middle line:84%
you put a nice, harmonious,
peaceful, pleasant frequency

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:49.397 align:middle line:84%
into the water, it
created something

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.107 align:middle line:90%
that's like a snowflake.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:56.737 align:middle line:84%
But negativity, it doesn't
have that kind of harmony,

00:19:56.737 --> 00:20:03.202 align:middle line:84%
and it comes across as a
very rough, blistering thing,

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:06.414 align:middle line:84%
and you get all these sort of
terrible, misshapen patterns

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:07.832 align:middle line:90%
that come out of it.

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.084 align:middle line:84%
And it's also similar to
what Cleve Backster was

00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:11.001 align:middle line:90%
doing with primary perception.

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:11.836 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With plants.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.838 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah, using
plants and subjecting them

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:17.633 align:middle line:84%
to these different frequencies
and seeing how they would grow.

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:20.302 align:middle line:84%
So this again takes
us to the idea

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:24.181 align:middle line:84%
that we have an
invisible component

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves-- our thoughts.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.394 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
mind-body relationship

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:90%
is so difficult to understand.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.818 align:middle line:84%
And by mastering
that and focusing

00:20:35.818 --> 00:20:40.739 align:middle line:84%
on what we want to happen,
we can rearrange our world

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.367 align:middle line:84%
in pretty profound
positive ways.

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:46.537 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking your thoughts
and turning them into music.

00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:49.165 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't do that and
you don't stay disciplined,

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:53.335 align:middle line:84%
you can just put a lot of noise
out there which creates chaos.

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:56.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this tell
you about this invisible world

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:58.174 align:middle line:90%
we're dealing with?

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, this invisible
world shows me that we are very

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
narrow-minded and egocentric
often because we think so much

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.604 align:middle line:84%
about that
got-to-see-it-to-believe-it

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:12.605 align:middle line:90%
attitude.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:15.483 align:middle line:84%
And that has held us back
a lot in our research.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:20.196 align:middle line:84%
Most of the world is, in
fact, invisible to us.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.326 align:middle line:84%
and there's this tiny
little sliver there

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.744 align:middle line:90%
we call visible light--

00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:29.914 align:middle line:84%
red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, violet.

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.957 align:middle line:84%
Outside of that,
you have ultraviolet

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:35.503 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
into gamma rays.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:38.172 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other end,
the low end, you have infrared

00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:40.674 align:middle line:84%
and then you get into radio
waves and microwaves and all

00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:41.926 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:44.345 align:middle line:84%
So that's just
what we know about.

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:51.101 align:middle line:84%
We are this tiny little
sliver of human interaction

00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:58.526 align:middle line:84%
within this huge spectrum
of life and information

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:01.362 align:middle line:84%
that's surrounding us
on a day-to-day basis.

00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we get to observe that
sometimes, but better yet,

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.452 align:middle line:84%
we can tap into it with our
minds, with our consciousness.

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:12.873 align:middle line:84%
And we can use it to make
the world a better place.

00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think if
everybody's happy then

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.836 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
a much happier world.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:21.215 align:middle line:84%
So we need to do everything we
can to make the world a better

00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:24.927 align:middle line:84%
place by giving people tools
to create something positive

00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:25.719 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you tried to
contact the spirit world?

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Absolutely, yeah.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.641 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Success?

00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:32.893 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I have
had some success.

00:22:32.893 --> 00:22:36.105 align:middle line:84%
The thing about trying to
contact the spirit world

00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
is often you get glimpses.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.693 align:middle line:90%
You get bits and pieces.

00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:44.363 align:middle line:84%
But having a full conversation
is a little more complex.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:48.784 align:middle line:84%
And recently, my friend Dean
Warsing came to Las Vegas.

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:52.496 align:middle line:84%
Dean is a professor of EVP
at a college in Maryland.

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:54.248 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Electro
voice phenomena.

00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:55.791 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Electronic
voice phenomena.

00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:58.419 align:middle line:84%
He is one of these guys who
goes out to cemeteries and stuff

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:00.921 align:middle line:84%
and he takes an audio
recorder, and he

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:03.632 align:middle line:84%
talks to the presumed spirits
and tries to get a voice.

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:05.092 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
you don't know it

00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:07.386 align:middle line:84%
until you take the recorder
back and listened to it, right?

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:08.929 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: That's
usually how it works.

00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:10.222 align:middle line:90%
So he came to Vegas.

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:13.017 align:middle line:84%
He said, let's go out and do
an experiment at a cemetery.

00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:17.146 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, but let's
take it to the next level.

00:23:17.146 --> 00:23:20.941 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just walking out
into a cemetery with a recorder,

00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:23.402 align:middle line:84%
I had a little vacuum
chamber with me.

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:24.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:28.741 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And I took
two identical recorders,

00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.492 align:middle line:84%
and I synchronized
them so they're

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:34.622 align:middle line:84%
both recording at the
same moment, same time.

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I put one of them inside
the vacuum chamber,

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.003 align:middle line:84%
and I left the other one
outside the vacuum chamber.

00:23:41.003 --> 00:23:45.424 align:middle line:84%
Now, then he conducted a session
talking to the tombstones,

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:46.884 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:49.637 align:middle line:84%
When this was all
over, I should have

00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:52.806 align:middle line:84%
been able to play those
audio recorders back and find

00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:56.393 align:middle line:84%
that the one inside
the vacuum was silent.

00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:59.521 align:middle line:84%
Because in a vacuum,
there is no way

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:02.941 align:middle line:84%
the sound vibrations
can penetrate

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:04.109 align:middle line:90%
to reach the recorder.

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:06.987 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've given us a
video of this vacuum experiment.

00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:08.989 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Watch what
happened when I played back

00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:11.784 align:middle line:84%
the recordings-- the one from
in the vacuum synchronized

00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:13.118 align:middle line:90%
with the one outside the vacuum.

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:14.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, I
look forward to this.

00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:17.831 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Three, two, one.

00:24:17.831 --> 00:24:22.753 align:middle line:84%
[CLAPS] That's our reference
point for all this.

00:24:22.753 --> 00:24:29.051 align:middle line:84%
So now, I want to stick
this into the vacuum.

00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:34.139 align:middle line:84%
According to D Minder,
the UV is three right now.

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:38.394 align:middle line:84%
Where I have two
identical audio recorders

00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:40.604 align:middle line:90%
that are both synchronized.

00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:42.564 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
between them right now,

00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:45.275 align:middle line:84%
as they are actively
reporting, is that one of them

00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:49.947 align:middle line:84%
is inside a vacuum chamber,
which I've pumped 15 times.

00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:52.825 align:middle line:84%
And so no acoustic
vibrations should be

00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:54.451 align:middle line:90%
able to affect us in any way.

we get something

on the one that's

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:23.397 align:middle line:84%
but we don't get anything
on the one that's

00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:26.775 align:middle line:84%
outside the backyard, that would
lead me to believe something

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:28.277 align:middle line:84%
profound had
occurred, that there

00:25:28.277 --> 00:25:31.488 align:middle line:84%
was some type of an
inexplicable force that

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:35.451 align:middle line:84%
had targeted the
interior [STATIC]

of [STATIC] specific

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:40.414 align:middle line:90%

On the other hand, if we
get [INTERFERENCE] the one

00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:43.834 align:middle line:90%
that's outside [INTERFERENCE].

00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:47.212 align:middle line:84%

guess what?

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.967 align:middle line:84%
Something started hitting that

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:18.911 align:middle line:84%
I've done this

00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you come
up with these experiments?

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.582 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, when
people are walking around

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:27.169 align:middle line:84%
with some type of a recorder,
often they'll play it back

00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:28.921 align:middle line:84%
and they'll get some
weird sound but they

00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:29.755 align:middle line:90%
don't know what caused it.

00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:31.173 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
their stomach growling

00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:32.174 align:middle line:90%
when they weren't aware of it.

00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:90%
It could have been a breeze.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.471 align:middle line:84%
It could have been a board
cracking in the house.

00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:40.474 align:middle line:84%
So I've always thought,
let's have a control here,

00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
a reference point that
we put inside the vacuum.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.938 align:middle line:84%
Because if you get a recording
on the outside of the vacuum

00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:50.234 align:middle line:84%
but not inside, then you'll know
this was just air vibration.

00:26:50.234 --> 00:26:53.821 align:middle line:84%
If you get one that's
both in the vacuum

00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:90%
and outside the vacuum--

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.073 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's going on.

00:26:56.073 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It was an
electromagnetic field

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.076 align:middle line:90%
was hitting.

00:26:59.076 --> 00:27:01.662 align:middle line:84%
But when you get something
inside the vacuum

00:27:01.662 --> 00:27:03.539 align:middle line:84%
but not outside
the vacuum, that's

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:05.958 align:middle line:84%
the weirdest result you can
get because what that means is

00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:10.879 align:middle line:84%
that some intelligence was
able to specifically pinpoint

00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:12.923 align:middle line:84%
that particular device
in that chamber.

00:27:12.923 --> 00:27:14.591 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And direct the sound.

00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:16.927 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And direct the
sound onto that device.

00:27:16.927 --> 00:27:19.805 align:middle line:84%
And so I've done this
experiment before.

00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:21.682 align:middle line:84%
You get nothing in
the vacuum chamber.

00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell
you one more thing

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:90%
that's fascinating about this.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Not only did we get results with
this interference apparently

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:32.109 align:middle line:84%
communicating with us,
but shortly thereafter it,

00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:34.361 align:middle line:84%
Dean looked up and flipped
out and said, Josh,

00:27:34.361 --> 00:27:35.487 align:middle line:90%
did you see that?

00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:38.073 align:middle line:84%
He said he saw a
UFO flying overhead.

00:27:38.073 --> 00:27:38.866 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:42.536 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: A silver ball shot
over the top of the cemetery.

00:27:42.536 --> 00:27:44.913 align:middle line:84%
So since then, a lot
of people have told me

00:27:44.913 --> 00:27:46.582 align:middle line:90%
they've had similar experiences.

00:27:46.582 --> 00:27:49.126 align:middle line:84%
They go to hunt ghost or
whatever at cemeteries,

00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:50.878 align:middle line:90%
and they end up seeing a UFO.

00:27:50.878 --> 00:27:53.505 align:middle line:84%
There's even film of
this-- footage of this.

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:58.468 align:middle line:84%
So is there a connection between
spirits and ghost and UFOs

00:27:58.468 --> 00:28:01.263 align:middle line:90%
or is that just coincidence?

00:28:01.263 --> 00:28:03.265 align:middle line:84%
Were we communicating
with the spirit

00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:07.352 align:middle line:84%
or were we communicating
with something from the UFO?

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:11.064 align:middle line:84%
These are a lot of little issues
to sort out, but it's amazing.

00:28:11.064 --> 00:28:12.858 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's your
gut tell you, Josh?

00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:15.652 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I feel like
that we were communicating

00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:17.905 align:middle line:84%
with a spirit but that
there was something

00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:20.574 align:middle line:90%
interested in that UFO.

00:28:20.574 --> 00:28:22.242 align:middle line:84%
It was checking out
what we were doing

00:28:22.242 --> 00:28:25.162 align:middle line:84%
because UFOs seemed to be
conscious sensitive entities.

00:28:25.162 --> 00:28:27.581 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it showed up
because of the experiment?

00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:28.582 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Probably, yes.

00:28:28.582 --> 00:28:29.791 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just to inquire?

00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:30.834 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: It was curious.

00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:32.753 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
who'd go out in the field

00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:35.464 align:middle line:84%
and they meditate, and they'd
try to telepathically connect

00:28:35.464 --> 00:28:38.175 align:middle line:90%
with UFOs and send them down--

00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:40.385 align:middle line:84%
stuff like Dr.
Steven Greer does.

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:42.429 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that
when you're out there

00:28:42.429 --> 00:28:45.974 align:middle line:84%
and you are sending out this
sort of communication vibe,

00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:48.268 align:middle line:84%
you might not even be
thinking about aliens

00:28:48.268 --> 00:28:50.562 align:middle line:84%
but you're hitting them at
the same time you're hitting

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.897 align:middle line:90%
the spirits in the graveyard.

00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:53.523 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember
the late Ed Grimsley?

00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:54.316 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: I do.

00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:56.568 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ed would bring his
night vision goggles out

00:28:56.568 --> 00:29:00.405 align:middle line:84%
on the top of buildings
and look at UFOs.

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:02.616 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
he manifested them

00:29:02.616 --> 00:29:04.409 align:middle line:90%
or if they were already there.

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: That's always one of
the big issues-- the chicken

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.956 align:middle line:90%
or the egg, the causality.

00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:11.583 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
when people are

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:14.336 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate
with spirits,

00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:18.382 align:middle line:84%
they might use a Ouija board
or they use some pendulums

00:29:18.382 --> 00:29:19.341 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:21.051 align:middle line:84%
And you're wondering,
well, is the person

00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:23.929 align:middle line:84%
influencing the
outcome subconsciously?

00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:24.721 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:27.099 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And that's why I
say using these types of tools

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:84%
or electronic tools, they
might give you bits and pieces.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.561 align:middle line:90%
They might be kind of helpful.

00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But I tell people
who really want

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.066 align:middle line:84%
to go out and try to communicate
with a spirit, here's

00:29:36.066 --> 00:29:39.027 align:middle line:84%
my advice, you can't
really sit down

00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:42.948 align:middle line:84%
and talk to a dog or a dolphin
and speak English and tell them

00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:44.116 align:middle line:90%
what you want them to do.

00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:45.325 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to get it.

00:29:45.325 --> 00:29:46.243 align:middle line:90%
You have to show them.

00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:48.662 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a different
sort of language or interface

00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:49.579 align:middle line:90%
in common.

00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you sit down with a
dog and you say to the dog,

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.668 align:middle line:84%
go get that stick, dog doesn't
know what you're talking about.

00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:57.462 align:middle line:84%
So if you pick up the stick
and you show the stick

00:29:57.462 --> 00:29:59.006 align:middle line:84%
and you throw it
and you point at it,

00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:01.049 align:middle line:84%
and then if they go and
they're smart enough to get it,

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:01.967 align:middle line:90%
you give them a treat.

00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:02.801 align:middle line:90%
They go, oh, OK.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:07.222 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very demonstrable
form of communication.

00:30:07.222 --> 00:30:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there
are beings around us that

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.686 align:middle line:84%
would love to just show up and
have a conversation with us,

00:30:12.686 --> 00:30:14.688 align:middle line:84%
but that's no easier
for them to do

00:30:14.688 --> 00:30:16.898 align:middle line:90%
than it is for us to do that.

00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:18.775 align:middle line:84%
So there's another
way to communicate

00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:21.361 align:middle line:84%
with these beings that is
usually more effective,

00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:25.741 align:middle line:84%
and it deals with shaping
your daily experience

00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:90%
through synchronicity.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.119 align:middle line:84%
In other words, let's
say you get up one day

00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:32.956 align:middle line:84%
and you say to your deceased
grandmother, Grandmother,

00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:36.126 align:middle line:84%
I would love to have an
interaction with you today,

00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:38.211 align:middle line:90%
and you put that out there.

00:30:38.211 --> 00:30:39.880 align:middle line:90%
And then you go about your day.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.631 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'll walk
past a window, you'll

00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:84%
see some flowers in
the window of a shop,

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and it's her favorite flowers.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.637 align:middle line:84%
And then you walk into the
shop and there's a book there,

00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:48.764 align:middle line:90%
and that book has them.

00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And in their signs and symbols--

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.267 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you smell her
perfume or something like that.

00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: This is
how you usually

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.856 align:middle line:84%
are able to tap into that
information of the spirit

00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:58.815 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:01.193 align:middle line:84%
Because cosmologists
and astrophysicists

00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:04.071 align:middle line:84%
tell us that there is no
such thing as past, present,

00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:04.863 align:middle line:90%
and future.

00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:06.406 align:middle line:84%
It's all happening
at once, and we're

00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:07.866 align:middle line:90%
sort of moving through it.

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:11.787 align:middle line:84%
So your grandmother is still
alive somewhere in this plane.

00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:12.621 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:31:12.621 --> 00:31:14.664 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And you
have to open your mind

00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:17.793 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how
that communication

00:31:17.793 --> 00:31:20.921 align:middle line:90%
forum is going to emerge.

00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:24.424 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that,
you will be led on

00:31:24.424 --> 00:31:28.303 align:middle line:84%
to a path that gives you
profound communication

00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:31.848 align:middle line:84%
with certain entities and
even the universe itself.

00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:34.643 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a paranormal
hotspot, Josh, and then gravity

00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:35.435 align:middle line:90%
mapping?

00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:36.269 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: [CHUCKLES]

00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:38.897 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're going to look
at a little video in a second.

00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:40.023 align:middle line:90%
But what are they?

00:31:40.023 --> 00:31:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: OK, so this is one
of the most interesting things

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:90%
that I'm working on right now.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.155 align:middle line:84%
Of course, a paranormal
hotspot is just

00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:51.201 align:middle line:84%
a place that is famous for some
kind of paranormal activity.

00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:55.205 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided to use
my years of research.

00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
things about what I do

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.166 align:middle line:90%
is it's multifaceted.

00:31:58.166 --> 00:31:59.668 align:middle line:90%
I don't just research one area.

00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:01.044 align:middle line:84%
I research just
about everything.

00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:02.379 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Multiple, yeah.

00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:04.464 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And I decided
to look at the whole world

00:32:04.464 --> 00:32:09.594 align:middle line:84%
and take famous sites in the
realms of the ghostly, UFOS,

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:13.431 align:middle line:84%
sacred sites, cryptids and
plot them on this global map.

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:16.184 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in terms
of famous haunted sites,

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:19.563 align:middle line:84%
I might pick Transylvania,
the Tower of London,

00:32:19.563 --> 00:32:22.566 align:middle line:84%
the Winchester
Mansion; UFO sites, I

00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:26.111 align:middle line:84%
might pick Area 51,
Roswell, maybe even

00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:31.783 align:middle line:84%
Tunguska; cryptid sites, Loch
Ness, Point Pleasant, West

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:34.244 align:middle line:84%
Virginia, Bluff
Creek, California.

00:32:34.244 --> 00:32:35.829 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bigfoot sighting spots.

00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Sacred sites might be
Bethlehem, the Great Pyramids,

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Chichén Itzá.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:42.586 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Dome.

00:32:42.586 --> 00:32:43.378 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah.

00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:44.754 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's in the--

00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:47.507 align:middle line:90%
Temple Mount and Machu Picchu.

00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:49.259 align:middle line:84%
And I color-coded
all these things

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:51.344 align:middle line:90%
and plotted them on a map.

00:32:51.344 --> 00:32:54.264 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
at comparisons

00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:58.518 align:middle line:84%
between the patterns and
other Earth mapping systems,

00:32:58.518 --> 00:33:02.397 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that
no matter what kind

00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:04.316 align:middle line:84%
of sacred site or
paranormal hotspot

00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:07.611 align:middle line:84%
it was, it seemed
to have a tendency

00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:13.325 align:middle line:84%
to match up with places on
Earth that often have a weaker

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:14.784 align:middle line:90%
gravitational field.

00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:15.911 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:18.205 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what you and
your team uncovered here.

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:22.542 align:middle line:90%
And what are we doing here?

00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:24.711 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: That's just a
list, like I was mentioning,

00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:27.923 align:middle line:84%
of some of the types of
places that I've color-coded.

00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:31.051 align:middle line:84%
I went to NASA's Jet Propulsion
Lab outside of Pasadena

00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:31.927 align:middle line:90%
where they actually--

00:33:31.927 --> 00:33:33.261 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you are.

00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:34.888 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Yeah,
and I studied what

00:33:34.888 --> 00:33:37.557 align:middle line:84%
they call the GRACE-FO
Project, which

00:33:37.557 --> 00:33:41.853 align:middle line:84%
measures all the gravitational
anomalies around the world.

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.772 align:middle line:84%
I talked to some of
the top scientists.

00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:47.359 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example of
some of the plotting here.

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:50.779 align:middle line:84%
Now, look at what
happens when we overlay

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.530 align:middle line:90%
this with a NASA gravity map.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.409 align:middle line:84%
Now on these particular
maps, areas of weaker gravity

00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:57.702 align:middle line:90%
shows up in red.

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:58.662 align:middle line:90%
Now look what happens--

00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:00.163 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which looked
like the whole country.

00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:01.373 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Well, look at this.

00:34:01.373 --> 00:34:02.540 align:middle line:90%
See those plot points?

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.919 align:middle line:84%
Look what happens when
I bleed in the red color

00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:08.964 align:middle line:84%
how those plot points
start matching up.

00:34:08.964 --> 00:34:10.715 align:middle line:90%
Now, of course, look at that.

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:14.052 align:middle line:84%
All around the edge
the country where

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:18.514 align:middle line:84%
we have most of these hotspots,
that's where you have that red.

00:34:18.514 --> 00:34:22.185 align:middle line:90%
Europe is almost entirely red.

00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's all
over the place.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: And look what
happens as we even take--

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:84%
we take a look at this
trailing down toward Australia.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.117 align:middle line:84%
Even parts of
Australia, where people

00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:39.369 align:middle line:84%
report the most
paranormal phenomena,

00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:42.246 align:middle line:90%
have that weaker gravity.

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a connection
between weak gravity

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.335 align:middle line:90%
spots and paranormal phenomena.

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:51.547 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You generated some
national publicity in 2018

00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:53.967 align:middle line:90%
with the Vegas time warp.

00:34:53.967 --> 00:34:54.759 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:55.927 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:59.931 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: Well, gravity
binds things together.

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:90%
It holds everything together.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.686 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
have weaker gravity,

00:35:04.686 --> 00:35:06.896 align:middle line:84%
it loosens things
up a little bit.

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:09.566 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as
thinning the veil.

00:35:09.566 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like it allows us to
interact a little bit more

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.778 align:middle line:90%
with other realms.

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:16.823 align:middle line:84%
Thinning the veil
with weak gravity.

00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:19.117 align:middle line:84%
And so I was really
interested in seeing

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:23.455 align:middle line:84%
if I could find a place where
time might flow differently

00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:26.583 align:middle line:84%
because of some
gravitational anomaly.

00:35:26.583 --> 00:35:28.126 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of
mine in California,

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:30.253 align:middle line:84%
an engineer named
Ronald Heath, invented

00:35:30.253 --> 00:35:33.131 align:middle line:84%
this device called a
DT-Meter, or differential

00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:35.842 align:middle line:84%
time rate meter, which
is able to show you

00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:38.553 align:middle line:84%
if time is slowing
down or speeding up

00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:42.307 align:middle line:84%
by very, very small margin,
just a split second.

00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:43.892 align:middle line:84%
Since I was living
in Las Vegas, I

00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:46.895 align:middle line:84%
said, well, I may as
well drive up to Area 51

00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:49.064 align:middle line:84%
and see if I get any
distortions around that base.

00:35:49.064 --> 00:35:50.398 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And don't get arrested.

00:35:50.398 --> 00:35:51.316 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: Yeah, right.

00:35:51.316 --> 00:35:52.942 align:middle line:90%
I've never crossed the fence.

00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:55.236 align:middle line:84%
And on the way up
there, I was stopping

00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:57.364 align:middle line:84%
in the desert about
every 20 miles

00:35:57.364 --> 00:35:59.741 align:middle line:90%
taking readings as controls.

00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:02.619 align:middle line:84%
At Area 51, I didn't
pick up anything unusual.

00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:05.622 align:middle line:84%
But at this sort
of nondescript spot

00:36:05.622 --> 00:36:08.375 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the road in
the desert north of Las Vegas,

00:36:08.375 --> 00:36:11.795 align:middle line:84%
I found that time slowed down
for a fraction of a second.

00:36:11.795 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even if milliseconds.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.339 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: That's right.

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:16.716 align:middle line:84%
It was 25 microseconds
per second.

00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:19.052 align:middle line:84%
But it's not supposed
to do that at all.

00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:22.931 align:middle line:84%
And then afterward, I found out
that that is one of the biggest

00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:24.099 align:middle line:90%
UFO hotspots in the country.

00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:25.183 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:27.018 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: People have
gotten lots of footage

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:29.062 align:middle line:90%
there, pictures there.

00:36:29.062 --> 00:36:31.189 align:middle line:84%
They've had close
encounters there.

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:34.943 align:middle line:84%
So right now, George, I am
working on some technology that

00:36:34.943 --> 00:36:38.405 align:middle line:84%
might be able to create a
miniature time machine that

00:36:38.405 --> 00:36:42.200 align:middle line:84%
would slow time down by
a fraction of a second

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.993 align:middle line:84%
in order to enhance
paranormal phenomenon.

00:36:43.993 --> 00:36:45.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you got
into a time machine,

00:36:45.787 --> 00:36:47.747 align:middle line:84%
would you go
backwards or forwards?

00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:50.708 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: It would be
easier to go backward.

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:53.753 align:middle line:84%
And I think I probably--
if I had a choice, though,

00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:58.258 align:middle line:84%
I would go backward because I
would be interested in seeing

00:36:58.258 --> 00:37:00.885 align:middle line:84%
history as it actually
played out as opposed--

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:04.514 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What point of time
would you like to go to first?

00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:08.685 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I'd love to go to
Nikola Tesla's laboratory

00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and see some of the
stuff that he was doing.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd like to
go see Jesus preaching.

00:37:12.355 --> 00:37:14.232 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I would go
back to Jesus, his time.

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:15.483 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to see the crucifixion.

00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:16.943 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd want
to be a witness.

00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WARREN: I'd like
to see dinosaurs.

00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:23.783 align:middle line:84%
But there are all kinds
of fascinating things

00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:25.660 align:middle line:84%
throughout history
that we missed out on.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see
PT Barnum's museum

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.707 align:middle line:84%
in New York, what kind of
crazy stuff did that guy have.

00:37:30.707 --> 00:37:33.877 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are so many
fun things that you could do.

00:37:33.877 --> 00:37:37.505 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think we'll be able
to travel that far back anytime

00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:38.298 align:middle line:90%
soon.

00:37:38.298 --> 00:37:40.383 align:middle line:84%
But the way things are
going in the world,

00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:42.802 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd rather go back in
time than go in the future.

00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:43.136 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:43.136 --> 00:37:43.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm not going there.

00:37:43.845 --> 00:37:45.638 align:middle line:84%
Josh, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:37:45.638 --> 00:37:46.806 align:middle line:90%
>>WARREN: I thank you, George.

00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great work.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.393 align:middle line:84%
Joshua Warren is showing us
the invisibility cloaking

00:37:50.393 --> 00:37:53.688 align:middle line:84%
techniques and how they work,
and the reports of spirits,

00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:56.149 align:middle line:90%
UFOs, magical manifestations.

00:37:56.149 --> 00:37:58.276 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to find
out more about Josh's work,

00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:01.362 align:middle line:84%
