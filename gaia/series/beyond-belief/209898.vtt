00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK POPE: For
years, NASA said, we're

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.330 align:middle line:90%
not interested in UFOs.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.345 align:middle line:90%
We don't investigate.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And then, now--

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: And then they do.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --bang.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.577 align:middle line:84%
What do you think of the
James Webb telescope?

00:00:19.577 --> 00:00:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Oh, my goodness--
one of the wonders

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:90%
of the modern world.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
scientific community

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:84%
is catching up where
the UFO community has

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:90%
been for 80 years.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The answers
are going to come,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
come in a big way.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Some people will
react with fear, others

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:90%
with a sense of wonder.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And one day,
experts like you, Nick,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
will be able to
say, I told you so.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.905 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:10%
He's with us, Nick Pope--

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:10%
author, journalist who ran
the British government's UFO

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:10%
program for more
than two decades.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the world's
leading authorities

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:90%
on UFOs and the unexplained.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Nick, welcome to the program.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Thank you.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.847 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be back.

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I have been busy.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:84%
What a time it's been
for this subject.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
National committees,
congressional committees,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and NASA announcing
that they've formed

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:90%
another group of committee.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:90%
What do they plan to do?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Well, set up a review of
unidentified aerial phenomenon

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:10%
and really join, I
suppose, the effort that

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:10%
is already underway, in
the intelligence community

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:10%
and the Department of Defense,
and bring scientific focus

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:10%
to this.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course,
for years NASA said,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:90%
we're not interested in UFOs.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
We don't investigate.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And, then now--

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: And then they do.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --bang.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah, right back in it.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there something
going on we really

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:90%
don't know about yet?

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I can't
help but wonder.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in
government, you don't

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.122 align:middle line:90%
want to be reacting to things.

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:56.330 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be passive.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want
to be the leader.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.827 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: You want
to be the leader.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you know
something's coming,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
or if you strongly
suspect that something's

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
coming-- either literally
or some great revelation--

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
you want to get ahead
of the narrative.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: So I think one
hypothesis is that all of this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
is what we're seeing,
and that NASA are perhaps

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:84%
going to be the ones who say,
we've made the announcement.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:90%
We've made a discovery.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:90%
There is something.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
We've found something-- perhaps
with the James Webb Space

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Telescope, perhaps
with Hubble, perhaps

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
with some other optical
or radio telescope.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
But ideally, of
course, that's the way.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the way that they could
then get around the cover

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:90%
up and the conspiracy.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:84%
They could essentially
say, look, science

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.343 align:middle line:90%
has made this discovery.

00:02:45.343 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We just
found out, right?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: We just found out.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, a lot of people
will be saying, wait a minute.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You've known about
this for 80 years.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because we did too.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
People will say,
come on, what do you

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:90%
mean you've just found it?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.945 align:middle line:84%
You've known about
this for decades.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:90%
You've been covering it up.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they're hoping that
the societal impact of this

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:84%
will be such that they
can just get beyond that

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and they can maybe say, oh,
that's just crazy conspiracy

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.370 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Here's the science.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Are you privy to UFO files
from Britain anymore?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I don't-- or at least
I don't think I have a current

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:90%
security clearance.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.808 align:middle line:84%
But I do stay in touch
with some colleagues.

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
some friends there.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.308 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I have friends.

00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't be in an organization
like that 21 years and not

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:90%
still network.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what did
they tell you, Nick?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: It's
difficult. There are

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:84%
factions on this, as
there always have been.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:84%
There is a hardcore skeptical
faction that, at the moment,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
in the UK, has the
dominant position.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
want to touch this.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Either that, or they've been
told by the US government,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:90%
don't touch this.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.535 align:middle line:90%
We are dealing.

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:02.335 align:middle line:90%
We are leading.

00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the US government
have that kind of cloud

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:90%
with the Brits?

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Oh, yes.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the US is the
senior force in NATO.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It's arguably the world's
greatest superpower.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when they say jump, the
UK generally says, how high?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.899 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's true.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I mean, we are
very much, in the UK,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:84%
the junior partner in the
so-called special relationship.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you think
of the Congressional hearings

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:90%
on UFOs?

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I was a little
disappointed, frankly.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It's a mixed bag.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I think the most important
thing was that it was done.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.613 align:middle line:90%
I mean it-- often--

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did something.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.072 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It did something, yeah.

00:04:43.072 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
For years, Congress
wasn't touching this.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
said, come on,

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
this is a defense and
national security issue.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.940 align:middle line:90%
You should be looking.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was one of
the subcommittees of the House

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Committee
that had the hearing.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:84%
But other committees
and subcommittees,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
in both the Senate
and the House,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:84%
are looking too-- so
the Armed Services

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Committee, the Intelligence
Committee, Appropriations too.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
people suddenly in this.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:84%
As I say, I think
it's a mixed bag.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.860 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't disclosure, but
it was a step forward.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And it put into the
Congressional record

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.945 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of--

00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was critical.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the great
things, for example,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
was that they asked about the
1967 Maelstrom Air Force Base

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:90%
case where it's alleged that--

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They shut down
the nuke site, right?

00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: That's correct, yes.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:84%
That's now on the record because
in the defense bill, of course,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:84%
there were multiple
UFO provisions.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things in
there was that they had said,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
we want to know about any
incident where UFOs are seen

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.880 align:middle line:84%
around nuclear facilities--
whether they're missile sites,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:90%
nuclear power stations--

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That woke them up.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It woke them up, yeah.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
They looked decidedly
uncomfortable.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:84%
They, at first, I
think, almost denied it.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Then, they acknowledged that
they might have heard of it,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't think they
had any information on it.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.573 align:middle line:84%
Well, Captain Robert
Salas, who was there--

00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was there.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:90%
He was a witness.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And he had written to Congress,
putting his own account

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:90%
before the committee.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:90%
So there was no excuse for it.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But it was good that it
was read onto the record.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:90%
The Wilson Memo and--

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Admiral Wilson, yeah.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: That was read into
the Congressional record too.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia News jumped
all over this hearing.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>> A historic public hearing
this week on Capitol Hill,

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:84%
as the House Intelligence
Counter-terrorism,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Counter-intelligence,
and Counter-proliferation

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Subcommittee held the first
open UFO hearing since 1966.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:10%
This hearing comes after some
lawmakers were reportedly not

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:10%
impressed by the
classified briefings

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:10%
they had received as part of the
National Defense Authorization

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:10%
Act.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:10%
In his opening
statement, Scott Bray,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.162 align:middle line:10%
the Deputy Director of Naval
Intelligence, had this to say.

00:07:21.162 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT BRAY: We have
seen an increasing number

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:84%
of unauthorized and/or
unidentified aircraft

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
or objects in
military-controlled training

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:90%
areas--

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
in training ranges and
other designated airspace.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Reports of sightings are
frequent and continuing.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> He went on to say one of the
reasons they have more reports

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:84%
is because of their work
to de-stigmatize the idea

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
of reporting UFOs and putting
into place a system to report

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:10%
Despite there being
no major revelations,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:10%
there were several notable
moments in the hearing.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:10%
Chairman Schiff brought
up reports of aircraft

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:10%
showing abnormal
flight characteristics.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAM SCHIFF: Are we aware of
any foreign adversary capable

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:10%
of moving objects without
any discernible means

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:10%
of propulsion?

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BRAY: I think I would--

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:84%
without discernible
means of propulsion.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:10%
I would say that we're not
aware of any adversary that

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:10%
can move an object
without discernible means

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:10%
of propulsion.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Which begs the question
if it's not an adversary,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:10%
then what is it?

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:10%
>> If they have--

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to quote
Lue Elizondo on this--

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:10%
then they've made a
generational leap in technology.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.942 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, we better be
paying attention.

00:08:35.942 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:10%
But these things
have been flying--

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:10%
see, this is the stupid
thing about the fact

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:10%
that they put the stigma
on it's back 50 years ago

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:10%
and said, oh, there's
nothing to see here.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.140 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.290 align:middle line:10%
Things have been flying circles
around our aircraft since World

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:10%
War II.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:10%
>> And there was this exchange
when Congressman Gallagher

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:10%
asked about UFO interference
around US nuclear missile

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.702 align:middle line:10%
sites.

00:09:01.702 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE GALLAGHER: It's
also been reported

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:10%
that there have
been UAP observed,

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle line:10%
and interacting with, and
flying over sensitive military

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:10%
facilities, particularly--
not just ranges,

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:10%
but some facilities housing
our strategic nuclear forces.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:10%
One such incident allegedly
occurred at Malmstrom Air Force

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:10%
base, in which 10
of our nuclear ICBMs

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:10%
were rendered inoperable
at the same time.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.708 align:middle line:10%
A glowing red orb was
observed overhead.

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm not commenting on
the accuracy of this.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.653 align:middle line:10%
I'm simply asking you
whether you're aware of it

00:09:27.653 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:10%
and whether you have any comment
on the accuracy of that report.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Let me pass that to Mr. Bray.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:10%
You've been looking at UAPs
over the last three years.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRAY: That data is not within
the holdings of the UAP Task

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pretty dramatic
stuff, though, Nick.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Really dramatic.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think my favorite
bit of the hearing

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:84%
was the question where
this whole issue-- which

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Lue Elizondo has mentioned--
of trans medium travel

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:90%
was mentioned.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And they asked, well, some
of these objects, apparently

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.910 align:middle line:84%
they fly seamlessly between the
atmosphere and then underwater.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And the response was, we'll
take that in the classified

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:90%
briefing.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So even mention of that led to
that defensive embarrassment.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, of course,
after the public hearing,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:90%
they went into closed session.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.335 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things that happened there.

00:10:22.335 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think is going on, Nick?

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
pretty dramatic stuff.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It is dramatic.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And isn't it
interesting with this,

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
again, the Navy seemed to
be in a dominant position.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:90%
And where's the Air Force?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was one of the
great UFO community tropes,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, in the
'80s and the '90s.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:84%
People said, oh,
it's kind of odd.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.523 align:middle line:84%
But somebody came
and debriefed me,

00:10:50.523 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:90%
and they were from the Navy.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And people thought, this
doesn't really make sense.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:90%
It would be the Air Force.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:90%
They land on Blue Book?

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Why would the Navy do it?

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And now, in recent
years, what have we seen?

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
US Navy jets, US Navy ships,
US Navy briefers in Congress--

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:90%
it's the Navy.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just
seems like everything

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.650 align:middle line:84%
you've been working
for, everything

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
we've been reporting
on over the years,

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
it's all coming down to a
few more meetings, a few more

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:90%
decisions.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they're
going to tell us.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, I hope so.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is an
ongoing process.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
There will be more
classified briefings.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.325 align:middle line:90%
There will be more, I'm sure.

00:11:32.325 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's got to be.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.783 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, there's got to be.

00:11:34.783 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, there will
be public hearings, too,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
where people like Chris
Mellon, Lue Elizondo,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe myself from the UK, can
come and put onto the record

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.100 align:middle line:84%
some of the things that we have
researched and investigated.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you have
testified, if they had asked?

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I think I would
still have to check

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:84%
with the UK Ministry of Defense
that that was acceptable.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But again, it goes
back to the point

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:84%
that the US is the
dominant partner in NATO.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And if they said, we
want this guy and maybe

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:84%
some other people from
the UK to testify, then

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the MOD would,
or maybe could, object.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
live in the US now.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm a green card holder.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.985 align:middle line:84%
They could probably
summon me and call me.

00:12:29.985 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you'd go.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I would go.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'd go.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I would
go because I think

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
it is incumbent on
those of us who've

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
done this from the inside
to, within the confines

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
of our security oaths,
to talk about this.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And if we get into
classified areas, of course,

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
it may have to be
in a closed session.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But the important point is
to get the information out.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Harvard's Avi Loeb has a project
called the Galileo Project.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.925 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I'm actually
an affiliate member.

00:13:03.925 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, are you?

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, good.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I'm not a scientist.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But Professor Loeb has
asked a number of people,

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and again, it's the
same names crop up--

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Chris Mellon, Lue Elizondo,
myself, some others.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
heavy-hitters of Ufology.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, to
hopefully contribute

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
in an advisory capacity so that
Avi Loeb and his Science Board

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:90%
can take decisions.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But what he is doing
is, effectively,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
what NASA is doing, taking a
scientific look at, actually,

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.995 align:middle line:84%
three different
aspects of all this.

00:13:43.995 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what are they?

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Interstellar objects.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So Oumuamua was
this funny-shaped--

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --strange object, yeah.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Exactly.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Avi Loeb and some others
thought it was artificial.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.440 align:middle line:90%
He still does.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.898 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: He does,
yeah, absolutely--

00:13:59.898 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
a derelict or
dormant spacecraft,

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
a lightsail, something like
that, but extraterrestrial.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the Galileo Project will
look for other interstellar

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
objects and then
hopefully collaborate

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:90%
on a mission to intercept them.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Simultaneously, they will
look at some UAP data

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and collect some data themselves
with their own telescopes.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, look-- and this is a
really fascinating idea-- look

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:84%
for evidence of extraterrestrial
satellites parked perhaps

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
in a polar orbit
around the Earth.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's really destigmatizing
the whole UFO research

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and investigation
effort and saying,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.892 align:middle line:90%
let's be scientific about it.

00:14:50.892 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've heard
of the Black Knight

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Satellite, haven't you?

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I have, yes.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say it's a
artificial satellite put there

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.145 align:middle line:84%
by some alien civilization
circling the planet.

00:15:03.145 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: And it makes sense.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it makes sense.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
If we are being visited
by extraterrestrials,

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's exactly
what they'd do, surely.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Rather than missions--

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.673 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We would do that.

00:15:13.673 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Exactly.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much, we've
done it-- or at least

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:84%
with some of the Mars
orbiter, for example.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:90%
You park a spacecraft up there--

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sure, you land as
well-- but you have an orbiter,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and then you take multiple
photos and videos.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
a civilization would do.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Why travel back and forward,
and back and forward,

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.890 align:middle line:84%
when you can just
stay and gather data?

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think of
the James Webb telescope, Nick?

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Oh, my goodness.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's one of the
wonders of the modern world.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in terms
of its sensitivity,

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:84%
the analogy that
I've heard used is

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that it would be able
to detect a bumblebee

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.433 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the moon.

00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or the first
light from the universe.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:90%
So let's face it.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
If there are, as many
believe, these so-called alien

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:90%
megastructures--

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.910 align:middle line:84%
like Dyson spheres,
for example--

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:21.660 align:middle line:84%
orbiting any of the stars in
our little part of the galaxy,

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.120 align:middle line:84%
then James Webb Space
Telescope should find them.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:90%
And that goes back--

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, that goes back to
the point about why is all this

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:90%
happening now--

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:84%
the point where you can't
keep the lid on a secret,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
because maybe, James Webb
is just going to show us

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:90%
there's aliens.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the point where
you want to get out ahead

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:90%
of the narrative.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And you'd get people ready.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:84%
You'd drip feed them,
acclimatize them, prepare them,

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:90%
and then, bang.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to Gaia News,
where Astronomer Mark Dantonio

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.440 align:middle line:84%
talked about the launch
of the James Webb.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:10%
>> The much-anticipated
James Webb Space Telescope is

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:10%
scheduled to finally launch
this month after a history

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:10%
of postponements and delays.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:84%
Why are astronomers so
excited about this telescope?

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK DANTONIO: If you look
at James Webb Space Telescope's

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.460 align:middle line:84%
capabilities, I think you'll
find that the James Webb is

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:25.140 align:middle line:84%
probably the most significant
mission in our history

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:90%
to this point on Earth.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
because what it stands

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:90%
to be able to show to us.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It might be able to
answer the question--

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
the real true question--
is there life out there?

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going
to be able to see

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:84%
the atmospheres of exoplanets
around distant stars.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see things
that might indicate

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:90%
that there is life there.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.087 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
important revelation

00:17:49.087 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:84%
we can't do right
now because we don't

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:84%
have a telescope that's really
got the resolution to do that.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, James Webb is there.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have that
strength on our side.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
important thing.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It could answer that
ultimate question.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The National Academies
of Sciences weighed

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:84%
in on their hopes
for the future.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:84%
What does astronomer Mark
Dantonio look forward to?

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DANTONIO: I hope that
we identify planets

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:84%
out there that are suitable
way stations for travelers

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
from Earth that eventually
might want to go there.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Sure, we can't fly the
gulf between the stars now,

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:90%
but we know a ways to.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And we know ways to do
it fast and quickly.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that I'd love to see.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
In 10 years, I'd love to see
an established program to do--

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I won't say
faster-than-light travel,

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:90%
but warped-space travel.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to see progress there.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to see the James Webb
give us candidates for planets

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that we think might actually
have signs of industrial

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:02.022 align:middle line:84%
pollutants, signs of oxygen in
the atmosphere inferred from

00:19:02.022 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
other chemicals in
the atmosphere--

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:84%
like carbon dioxide
and methane--

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:10.127 align:middle line:90%
and other possibilities.

00:19:10.127 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And those other possibilities,
that's the mystery.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:90%
What are those?

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, those are
signatures of life.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's spot on.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
he mentioned, but I

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.757 align:middle line:84%
mean, looking for greenhouse
gases, for example.

00:19:26.757 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.855 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: The chemical signature
of other civilizations.

00:19:29.855 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The signature
of life, that's right.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you talk
about a biosignature,

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and you also talk about
a techno signature.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's great that--

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:84%
it's like the
scientific community

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
is catching up where
the UFO community has

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:90%
been for 80 years.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were back at
the British Ministry of Defense

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:84%
looking at the UFO files,
and you had carte blanche

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever
you wanted, to say

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
whatever you wanted, what would
you be doing right now, Nick?

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I would be using
military satellites

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:90%
as the eyes and ears.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As your tool.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
there are a lot

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
of resources and capabilities
that we could access.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But former director of National
Intelligence John Ratcliffe

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
acknowledged that military
satellites track these things.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:10%
And so I would leverage the
capabilities that we already

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:10%
have and I would say that
military satellites represent

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.640 align:middle line:10%
our best chance of getting
high-resolution images.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
But then, the
all-important thing

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:84%
is to also leverage the
astronomical community,

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
and yes, James Webb too.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Get telescope time
because you don't just

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:90%
want to find these UFOs.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You want to see where
they're coming from

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and find out where
their homeworld is.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, absolutely.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And let's
just suppose it's

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.600 align:middle line:84%
a planet orbiting
Proxima Centauri, just

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:90%
over four light years away?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Then, as Mark was
saying, a star mission,

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that would be the
human races number-one

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:84%
scientific priority-- a
star mission to go there.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of
your favorite UFO cases?

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I
think the classics,

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.130 align:middle line:84%
of course, are Roswell,
Rendlesham Forest.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But also, some of the ones
in the US that excite me

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.703 align:middle line:90%
are the Phoenix Lights.

00:21:36.703 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
mentioned Rendlesham.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Richard Dolan talks
about Rendlesham Forest

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.480 align:middle line:90%
in the United Kingdom.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.085 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:21:43.085 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: Why is it considered
the most well documented event?

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.220 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what's the story?

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: It's
very well documented

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:10%
for a key reason,
which is that there

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:56.630 align:middle line:10%
was an official memo written
about it by Colonel Charles

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:10%
Halt a few weeks
after it occurred.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:10%
So that was absolute
confirmation of the event.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.530 align:middle line:10%
On top of that--

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.030 align:middle line:10%
>>SPEAKER: It wasn't
classified immediately?

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It was
classified, but it was then

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.310 align:middle line:84%
retrieved a few years
later through a Freedom

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:middle line:90%
of Information Act request.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And almost, you would
say, by a stroke of luck,

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:84%
it was able to be obtained,
and we had this confirmation.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.840 align:middle line:84%
In the aftermath of
that, all the witnesses

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:90%
started coming out--

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:90%
not immediately.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
All through the
1980s, this is a story

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:84%
that developed with more
witnesses, more witnesses.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Through the 1990s, and in fact,
even into the 21st century,

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
we've had even more
additions to the story.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So the Rendlesham case is
like a gift that keeps giving.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get it all at once.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:90%
It's come out by--

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:90%
partly by drips and drabs.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.463 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's a
flood of information.

00:22:45.463 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: OK, so I have a
question to ask you then.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:90%
How many cases have to come out?

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:90%
It's been 50 years--

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.760 align:middle line:84%
well, if you go back as far as
Roswell, 60 years-- but more,

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that these cases
have been coming.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:84%
At what point does the
government, the military,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:84%
some official agency say,
OK, right, it's real.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.297 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
becoming absurd now.

00:23:08.297 --> 00:23:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I agree with you.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: A couple thousand
people in the desert,

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:90%
they all know it.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: We're at a point
where the emperor is wearing

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:84%
no clothes, and someone's
going to make the point

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, he's not
wearing anything at all.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
We're just about
there, it seems to me.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we've
had 20 years of internet

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and really 10 years of
a true internet, where

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:24.810 align:middle line:90%
we have all of this.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:90%
We have a web.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:90%
We have Gaia TV.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:90%
We have YouTube.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.092 align:middle line:90%
We have Skype.

00:23:29.092 --> 00:23:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We have all-- Facebook,
all of these ways

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
that we communicate with-- all
in the last decade, really.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's all new.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we
can see is that this

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:43.430 align:middle line:84%
has had a dramatic, profound
effect on our civilization.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But what we have
is the old paradigm

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:84%
is hanging on by
their fingernails.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.832 align:middle line:84%
And that old paradigm is one
of denial, of the obvious--

00:23:50.832 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say the
truth, but really denial

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:84%
of the obvious, I
think, is more apt.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.208 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.208 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
But they're still hanging-- you
know, there's the expression,

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing so powerful as
an idea whose time has come.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
part of that,

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
which is the second most
powerful thing is an idea that

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:90%
refuses to go away.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's where they're at.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:90%
So they're hanging on.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.285 align:middle line:90%
That paradigm is still there.

00:24:16.285 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But I think what we're
seeing is a real battle here

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:90%
between the old and the new.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And one day,
experts like you, Nick,

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
will be able to
say, I told you so.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:90%
That's going to happen.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I hope so.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's going to happen.

00:24:30.663 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Like Rendlesham, there's
some great cases out there,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:90%
aren't there?

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing
about all this

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:43.550 align:middle line:84%
is that even these unsolved,
classic cases, you never know.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just look
at police work.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, a new witness
will come forward.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, a new
scientific technique--

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.780 align:middle line:84%
DNA and forensics--
will enable you

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.210 align:middle line:84%
to do something that the
original investigators couldn't

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:90%
The same is true of UFO cases.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what witness
will suddenly come forward,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
what document might emerge,
what new technique could be

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:90%
brought to bear on an old case.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.650 align:middle line:90%
And that would be fascinating.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The answers
are going to come,

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to come
in a big way one day.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the
public's reaction will be?

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Will it be, well, we knew it?

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Shock?

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I told you so?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:90%
What will it be?

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: All of the above.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
I think, on this, just as
with the UFO phenomenon,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:90%
people are divided, polarized.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Some people will react to
the revelation with fear.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Others with a sense of wonder.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Some won't believe
it, which will

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:84%
be an irony, the government
saying, yeah, there's aliens,

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:90%
and they'll be--

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now,
they're not believing it.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yeah, new skeptics
will say, no, no, no,

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.280 align:middle line:90%
we don't believe the aliens.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't-- the government
must be covering up some--

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something else.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Something else.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's a cover story.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think the reactions will
be as diverse as society is.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, obviously it will
touch every aspect of society--

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
politics, religion, science,
technology, spirituality,

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
personal philosophy and
worldview, economics.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything will change.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other countries
are responding to this?

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.518 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, Brazil is
quite an interesting.

00:26:33.518 --> 00:26:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're in it in
a big way, aren't they?

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: They've always
been quite interested.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.120 align:middle line:84%
A lot of South
American countries

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.220 align:middle line:90%
have had some amazing cases--

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.057 align:middle line:90%
Brazil, Chile.

00:26:43.057 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about China?

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Russia?

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: They are in the game.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are?

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But we don't
know much about it.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese, it was
revealed a year or so ago,

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:84%
have a unit rather like the
UAP Task Force in the US,

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:90%
studying this.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:84%
They call them
something different.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't translate
exactly, but something

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:84%
like, "Unusual Atmospheric
Disturbance" or something

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:90%
But they've got a unit.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And, well, the secretive
and closed nature

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.040 align:middle line:84%
of Chinese society,
plus the classification,

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of course, which you
see in the West too,

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:84%
means that we don't
really what they're doing.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
they've discovered.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:84%
All this seems to have
popped up since the Academy

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:90%
to the Stars popped up.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:36.880 align:middle line:84%
How important do you think they
were in this study of ufology?

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: They were critical.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think you can make
a case that information

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:84%
was going to come out anyway,
that the people involved

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:84%
were going to speak out
one way or the other.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And they used-- and I don't
mean that in a cynical way.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I say they used
the to the Stars Academy

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.850 align:middle line:84%
as a vehicle, I mean
it was all amicable

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
talking to each other.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But it was very
clear that people

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:11.170 align:middle line:84%
had written off Tom DeLonge
as some aging punk musician.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:84%
But in the reality,
as we know from--

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, he showed them.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, we know,
from Wikileaks and a number

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:84%
of other sources,
that Tom DeLonge

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:24.730 align:middle line:84%
was talking to some very
senior figures in the military,

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence community,
and the aviation community,

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.300 align:middle line:90%
and the private sector.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was putting
together this team,

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
which included not just Chris
Mellon and Lou Elizondo,

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
but Jim Semivan, former CIA
of course, Steve Justice--

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.560 align:middle line:84%
a number of other
very heavy hitters.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they played
a critical role

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.930 align:middle line:84%
in moving this forward
and getting this out.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember years before
the Academy was even announced,

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:58.000 align:middle line:84%
we ran into Tom DeLonge
at a couple of UFO events.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And my producer
Tom Danheiser said,

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.540 align:middle line:84%
that's Tom DeLonge
from Blink 182.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And I went, who?

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
group Blink 182?

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.010 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah, but who's he?

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:12.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, he's one of the
biggest aspects of the group.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I said, well,
what's he doing here?

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Tom said, he loves UFOs.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Who knew that several
years later he'd

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:90%
be doing what he's doing?

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah, people--

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:27.782 align:middle line:84%
I remember, in 2017, when he
said, I'm working on something

00:29:27.782 --> 00:29:29.365 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
make an announcement.

00:29:29.365 --> 00:29:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that was it.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.802 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was like,
oh, you know, yeah, what?

00:29:33.802 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
tell us that you've

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:84%
been surfing the internet in
your bedroom or something?

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:90%
And then, bang!

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
"New York Times'" front page,
AATIP, US Navy UFO videos.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.505 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:29:45.505 --> 00:29:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the United
Nations helping out at all

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:90%
with this, Nick?

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: They're not.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, a number of people
say they should be.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, we've discussed
the global nature of this.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And if ever there's an issue
which the United Nations might

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:84%
grip and draw together these
disparate strands, this is it.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, you asked about
other countries.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
San Marino is also

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.335 align:middle line:84%
doing some work
behind the scenes.

00:30:14.335 --> 00:30:15.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:30:15.135 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: They used to have a UFO
conference which I attended,

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:23.800 align:middle line:84%
which bridged UFOs and
mainstream astronomy.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And now they are
apparently lobbying the UN

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.820 align:middle line:90%
to maybe take a view on this.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't think the UN want it.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I talked some years ago to the--

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
well, at the time, the head of
the UN Office of Outer Space

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Affairs, Dr. Mazlan Othman.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had an
organization for that?

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Now they do-- mainly they
do things like space law.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:90%
You know, satellites--

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who owns the moon?

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Who owns the moon?

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:55.952 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stuff like that.

00:30:55.952 --> 00:30:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Can anyone own the moon?

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And in 2010, I met Dr.
Othman and asked her--

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:90%
we were discussing.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.450 align:middle line:84%
We were both at a conference
at the Royal Society in the UK,

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:90%
and this came up.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was very clear
that the UN didn't really

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.380 align:middle line:90%
want this issue.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it went into the
all-too-difficult basket.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.785 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What scared them?

00:31:23.785 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I don't know.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Possibly the fact that
they knew or suspected

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that the US was
involved in this,

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:37.790 align:middle line:84%
but it was all classified-- and
Russia, and China, and others.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:90%
But again--

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Too much
of a hot potato?

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Hot potato maybe.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Again, some of the
issues that would arise--

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:84%
let's suppose we validate
this and then get,

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.900 align:middle line:84%
as many people believe we
already have, technology.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, who owns that technology?

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Who gets that technology first?

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a space race.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a new space race,
because the nation that does

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.330 align:middle line:90%
get it is going to be top dog.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And that's why I
suspect people aren't talking

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to each other,
because everyone wants

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to be the first to get
their hands on that.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:84%
One thing that might
shock all of these people,

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.300 align:middle line:84%
is that chances are it
won't even be a nation.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.420 align:middle line:84%
It'll be someone like
Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll buy
their way for information.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 75 years since Roswell.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Are we any closer to finding
out what happened there?

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: We are not.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But again, it goes
back to the point

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.870 align:middle line:84%
that you never know what
tomorrow will bring,

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.320 align:middle line:84%
what new information
might emerge.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing like an
anniversary to focus people.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
probably people

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:56.680 align:middle line:84%
in Roswell right now
talking about this, going

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.130 align:middle line:84%
through their attics,
going through their parents

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:05.140 align:middle line:84%
or their grandparents records
and boxes of mementos.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:84%
All it takes is one person
who served in the military--

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just one,
that's it, to go public.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: -- who was involved in
the clean-up operation, kept,

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.255 align:middle line:84%
as a lot of people
do, a souvenir.

00:33:15.255 --> 00:33:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little piece
here, a little piece there.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yeah, I'm
going to put this--

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll put this one in a
truck with the others.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.030 align:middle line:84%
But this one, I'll
put it in my pocket

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be on
the mantel piece.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.320 align:middle line:90%
All it takes is one.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ufologist Don
Schmidt loves the Roswell case

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.650 align:middle line:90%
and won't let it go.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
What has always baffled me,
Don, is the technology that

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:42.810 align:middle line:90%
would cause the craft to crash.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DON SCHMIDT: Yes, yes.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They got here
from God knows where,

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:84%
how many millions
of light years away,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.500 align:middle line:84%
through incredible technology
of bending space and time

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:90%
But why would it crash?

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, as I described
early on, if there was

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:04.060 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous lightning storm,
the original conclusions that

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:08.469 align:middle line:84%
we were already dealing with
an electromagnetic propulsion,

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:84%
anti-gravity, something that
essentially worked off as far

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:12.610 align:middle line:90%
as--

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:13.389 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What threw
it off-kilter?

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.181 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And just
imagine the combination

00:34:15.181 --> 00:34:16.989 align:middle line:90%
of that and lightning.

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:21.639 align:middle line:84%
And if we were dealing with
somewhat of a scout craft,

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.560 align:middle line:84%
launched from a
mothership or something--

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.239 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean to speculate.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't like
speculation, but if we

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.699 align:middle line:84%
were dealing more with an
atmospheric craft as opposed

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:31.740 align:middle line:90%
to an actual spacecraft.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, it
came aboard something.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: One of
the flight engineers,

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:84%
he was a flight mechanic
who worked with the 393rd.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.389 align:middle line:84%
His name was Sergeant
William Ennis.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:43.719 align:middle line:84%
So they worked on the silver
plates, the B-29 bombers.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:84%
They could take them apart down
to the last rivet, put them

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:48.460 align:middle line:90%
back together again.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And before he died,
he said to me, Don,

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:55.090 align:middle line:84%
before I go you have to find
out how that thing flew.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.872 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have a
moving part on it!

00:34:58.872 --> 00:35:00.205 align:middle line:90%
So again, what do you replicate?

00:35:00.205 --> 00:35:01.122 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anti-gravity.

00:35:01.122 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:84%
If you had a chance to talk
to those secret-keepers

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.550 align:middle line:84%
of information, what would
you ask them to reveal?

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHMIDT: Well, two things.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd ask them what would have
possessed them to essentially

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:18.930 align:middle line:84%
apply such fear and intimidation
to civilians where they have

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:23.930 align:middle line:84%
no authority, when they knew
that the balloon was going

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:27.730 align:middle line:84%
to be accepted, that
things were going

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.060 align:middle line:90%
to return to normal posthaste?

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And after all these years, why
is such fear and intimidation

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.600 align:middle line:90%
still being orchestrated?

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.060 align:middle line:84%
We still have witnesses
that get phone calls.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Walter Haut, his late
wife would tell us

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:84%
for 30 years they were getting
late-night phone calls still

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.430 align:middle line:84%
threatening, them still
warning them about this.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: So what's
going on here?

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that is
even out of your control?

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Beyond your technology?

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself would be
just a tremendous revelation.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And then secondly, if we are
dealing with an intelligence

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.830 align:middle line:84%
off the planet, is there--
has there been any contact?

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Are you in some way
cooperating with them?

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, are we
dealing with either something

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:90%
benevolent?

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Or are we dealing with something
that-- the great secret in all

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.110 align:middle line:84%
this is that we're
dealing with something

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:29.547 align:middle line:90%
that is still rather suspect.

00:36:29.547 --> 00:36:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they can't stop it.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHMIDT: And
they can't stop it.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:35.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you think
that might be the case, Nick?

00:36:35.027 --> 00:36:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It might be.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes use the
phrase "a secret

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.420 align:middle line:90%
too terrible to be told."

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.898 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder, with
some of that, maybe

00:36:43.898 --> 00:36:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that's what we're dealing with.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's one of
the best cases ever.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It is.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:52.090 align:middle line:84%
There's just witness, after
witness, after witness,

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:52.960 align:middle line:90%
many of whom--

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many of
whom died, right?

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the point
about using new techniques

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:84%
a while ago, one of
the new techniques

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.680 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking
about, which is

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
using artificial intelligence to
try and tell whether someone's

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.550 align:middle line:90%
telling the truth or not.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this takes something
like a polygraph and--

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they
polygraphed Travis Walton,

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.350 align:middle line:90%
and he told the truth.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yeah, well
these AI techniques

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:25.990 align:middle line:84%
were brought to bear on
historical interviews

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.120 align:middle line:90%
with Roswell witnesses.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much all
the important ones,

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.980 align:middle line:84%
on the key points, were
judged to be truthful.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, this technology is
still in its infancy.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
has its detractors,

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.177 align:middle line:84%
but the AI is only going
to get better and better.

00:37:43.177 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And that's something
that can be brought to bear.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, you can
do it with Roswell.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.810 align:middle line:90%
You can do it with Rendlesham.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.320 align:middle line:84%
You can do it with
all the cases.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think we know,
deep down inside, what

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.460 align:middle line:90%
happened at Roswell, don't we?

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.170 align:middle line:90%
We really know.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I think the
idea that it was indeed

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.750 align:middle line:84%
the crash of an
extraterrestrial spacecraft

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:09.370 align:middle line:84%
is now so firmly embedded
in popular culture,

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:84%
that going back to your
point about how would people

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:84%
react, I think a lot
would say, told you so!

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.343 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We knew it!

00:38:16.343 --> 00:38:17.200 align:middle line:90%
We knew it!

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah, no.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
In the movie
"Independence Day" there

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:84%
was that great
scene on the plane

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:27.063 align:middle line:84%
where one of the characters
was saying about Area 51.

00:38:27.063 --> 00:38:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
president was, right?

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, and yeah, it was
saying basically, yeah, look,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:84%
the government-- somebody
was accusing the president

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.660 align:middle line:90%
of being part of this cover-up.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: And mentioning Area 51.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.210 align:middle line:10%
And the president was
saying, let me assure you

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:49.900 align:middle line:10%
that all this stuff of aliens
and Area 51, it's not true.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And the character who plays
the Secretary of Defense

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.460 align:middle line:84%
says, Mr. President, that's
not entirely correct.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tight shot
of the president.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Oops!

00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Nick, how do people
get a hold of you?

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.020 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: My website
is nickpope.net,

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.320 align:middle line:10%
and my Twitter account,
which is the social media

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.910 align:middle line:10%
platform on which I'm most
active, is @nickpopemod.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keep up the good work.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I'll try.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:15.040 align:middle line:90%
It

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
eventually, it's

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:18.820 align:middle line:84%
because of people
like you that'll

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.920 align:middle line:84%
get us the answers to
this incredible question,

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.055 align:middle line:90%
are we alone in the universe?

00:39:24.055 --> 00:39:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, it's
a team effort,

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:28.090 align:middle line:84%
but if I can play a
part, I'm glad to do so.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:33.460 align:middle line:84%
We're pushing the door open,
now it's time to kick it in.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Nick, for
being on the program.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Thank you.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And once you
do open up that door,

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:10%
who really knows what's
on the other side?

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:43.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:49.000 align:middle line:90%
