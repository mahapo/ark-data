>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:10%
We've got a great guest for you.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:10%
Georgina Cannon is an author,
speaker, original founder

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:10%
of Canada's largest hypnosis
school and clinic, called

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:10%
the Ontario Hypnosis Center.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:90%
And she is an NLP master--

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
that in a moment--

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and recently published a
new book called "Your Guide

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:90%

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.495 align:middle line:84%
Georgina, welcome
to the program.

>>GEORGINA CANNON: Thank you.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.725 align:middle line:90%
It's a delight to see you again.

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I've always loved
your name because my mother is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:90%
called Georgette--

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Ah.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.618 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: --and that's
pretty darn close.

00:00:48.618 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It is.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where'd
you get the name?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:10%
>>CANNON: I think my parents
were expecting a boy so they

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.675 align:middle line:10%
were going to call me George.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:10%
My best friend also
calls me George,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.395 align:middle line:10%
which confuses a lot of people.

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:10%
So but when they saw
that I was a girl,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:10%
they changed it to Georgina,
which is an Old English name,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:10%
as you know.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.920 align:middle line:90%
And I've enjoyed it.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's a great name.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:90%
It's fitting for you.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Thank you.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, what
is an NLP Master?

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: NLP stands for
Neuro-Linguistic Programming,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
which is a process by which
you use language to study

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:90%
the modalities of success.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And you break it down,
and you teach people

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.620 align:middle line:84%
how to use it in
minute dimensions

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:84%
so that you become
successful at everything.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:84%
The original founders
of NLP studied

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
people who were
successful in everything,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:84%
whether it be
sports, biochemistry,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
science, and discovered what it
was that made them successful--

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
how they thought,
how they moved.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And that's what
we take into the process,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and we teach other people how to
do it-- be successful at life.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did they find
common denominators

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.615 align:middle line:90%
with these successful people?

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, always.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Common denominators is that you
can imagine being successful.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
You can see yourself
as a success.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Let's--
give me an example.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's say Jeff
Bezos from Amazon.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%
What would they see in him?

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: They might
see that he's a planner.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:84%
They might see that he
understands the bigger

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:84%
picture, but not only
the bigger picture,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
but he understands the
method of how to get there.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And they might take
something that he

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
has done from inception
to where it is now

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.225 align:middle line:84%
and see the path
that that's taken.

00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just blue-skying.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
It is innovating, creating, and
implementing how to get there.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you teach
people how to get there?

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Or do they
already have that ability

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:90%
to do it on their own?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Some people
do, some people don't.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what coaching
is all about.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So some people just blue sky
and come up with great ideas

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
but don't know how
to achieve them

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.800 align:middle line:84%
or if, in fact,
they're practical.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So we discuss it, and we say,
well, what's the solution

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:90%
after next?

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:90%
So you've achieved that.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:90%
How does that look?

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:90%
How does it manifest for you.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And how does it manifest for
the world and the people you

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:90%
want to impact with that idea?

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Does it make
people a better person?

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.015 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It makes them a
more understanding person.

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:12.825 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: To who?

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.848 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: To themselves
and to other people.

00:03:14.848 --> 00:03:15.765 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting.

00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, when you wrote
the book, your latest book,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.475 align:middle line:90%
tell me about this.

00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It suddenly
dawned on me one day

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
that we see ourselves,
the way we've

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
been told to see ourselves, the
way our parents have told us

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:84%
that we are or society
or school or whatever,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
but we've never had a
personal look at who we are.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, that
might be interesting.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we go through life
knowing that we're this

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
or we're that or the other,
that people have told us we are,

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
both through business
and through school

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.895 align:middle line:90%
and through life.

00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So I searched for experts that
could use different modalities

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
to explain how we can find
out more about ourselves

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and asked them to
write a chapter

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
for their particular modality
so that the reader could say,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:84%
oh, I didn't know
that about myself.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
each chapter, there's

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.785 align:middle line:84%
a little questionnaire
that says,

00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:17.368 align:middle line:84%
what did you discover
in this chapter?

00:04:17.368 --> 00:04:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's novel.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.070 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And at
the end of the book,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
they get to introduce
themselves to their new self.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.797 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And do they
like the new self?

00:04:25.797 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, I
think human nature

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:84%
being what it is,
they will let go

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
of the things they don't like
and discover understandings,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:90%
new understandings.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when I was
talking to Kathy Biehl

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:84%
about her chapter,
and I said, how can

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
you read hands on Zoom
because you don't see people,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and she works with
people around the world.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.063 align:middle line:84%
She said, hold up your hand,
and I held it up to the screen.

00:04:50.063 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
boy, you're resilient.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well,
yeah, you could see.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.253 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: So I said,
how can you tell that?

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, and she went
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:90%
blah.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, yes
I, am resilient.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that that's
what it was that kept me going.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
So now I know I'm resilient.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We have a palm reader
who comes on the radio show

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast," and he does
palm reading by Zoom the same

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:90%
way--

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Same thing.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: --holding up
your hand and same thing.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
We've got a picture of
the cover of your book.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at it.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: OK, great.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.672 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And tell us what
we're looking at here.

00:05:21.672 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Well, as you can
see, butterflies change,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:90%
and the flower is blossoming--

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
"Your Guide to Self
Discovery and Twenty Ways

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:90%
to Find the True You."

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's about you, who you are.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, these
are my favorite colors.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.133 align:middle line:84%
And the designers at
Llewellyn didn't know that,

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
but when they
designed the cover I

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
was thrilled, because yellow
and blue, my home is--

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of color in it,
mostly yellow and blue.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's what that
really looks like,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:90%
and that's what it stands for.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Some people, Georgina,
self-discover and decide,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't like who I am.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: If they do, it's a
perfect opportunity to change,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:84%
because until you know
what you're dealing with,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:90%
you can't make change.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't like who
you are because you're

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
a procrastinator,
or you don't like

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
who you are because you
shoot yourself in the foot

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.780 align:middle line:84%
You get going, but you don't
quite complete anything.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And you suddenly say, you know,
I don't like that about myself.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
That's when you say, oh,
what can I do about that?

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, you
find someone who's

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
a coach, counselor, hypnotist,
regression therapist who

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:90%
can help you--

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.348 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's what you do.

00:06:34.348 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: --that's what I do--
find the new way of becoming

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:90%
who you would like to be.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but you can envision

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you
would like to be,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:84%
what it looks like, how it
affects the others around you,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
how it will affect your life
when you make that change.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How soon do
you see the changes?

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Sometimes
within two sessions.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it takes
a little longer,

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
depends on how radical
the change has to be.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing about
change is that sometimes, we

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
lose the friends we've carried
with us because of the way

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:90%
we are.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.815 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Things happen.

00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: And things happen.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And when we change, we
become stronger in ourselves,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and we know who we are.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you know who you
are, you develop boundaries.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes, the people
who've crossed your boundaries

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.665 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be part of your
friendship circle anymore.

00:07:26.665 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What experts
contributed to your new book,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.248 align:middle line:90%
what type of people?

00:07:31.248 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh, there's
a whole pile of them.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:90%
There's Kathy Biehl.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.108 align:middle line:84%
There's Beryl Comar,
who lives in Spain.

00:07:37.108 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Tell me
what each one does.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.233 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh, I wish
I could remember.

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I need the list in front of
me because there's 18 of them

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:90%
because I wrote three chapters.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:90%
There's 18 of them.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So Lee-Anne McAlear writes
about creativity and innovation.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.005 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did you seek them out?

00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.557 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I
looked for experts

00:07:58.557 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:84%
that knew what they
were talking about

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and had written books, because
I wanted people who could write

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.605 align:middle line:90%
in a way that was engaging.

00:08:04.605 --> 00:08:05.405 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:08:05.405 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: OK, there's no
point in writing if it flows

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:90%
above your head or whatever.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I want people to
engage the reader.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I went and asked
them if they would add

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:90%
to this book and the concept.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Do they like the concept?

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:84%
If they like the concept,
please come join us.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:90%
So we have numerology.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We have birth order, which
I'm a great believer in.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:90%
We have a family dynamics.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:84%
We have SWOT, which is
Strengths, Weaknesses,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:90%
and Opportunities and Threats.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.705 align:middle line:90%
We have--

00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you run
the full gamut, though.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Sorry?

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You run the gamut.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole gamut of people.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.559 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, one
of those experts,

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Lee-Anne McAlear, excellent,
shares her discovery

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle line:84%
on how to develop
her true self through

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.765 align:middle line:90%
your creative superpowers.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's right.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:84%
- I would like to help reframe
how we think about creativity.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
The research would show that
creativity shows up, actually,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:84%
best in creative
problem-solving,

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
how we approach, creatively,
the challenges we face.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And the research would say
that there are four stages

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:90%
in creative problem-solving.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Those stages are the definer,
and the definer is that person.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Their creative
superpower, if you will,

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
is they are incredible
questioners.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:84%
They work to clarify
the issue or opportunity

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
or challenge that
they are facing,

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and they ask the best, most
interesting questions to do so.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And once that's done, the
next stage is for the dazzler.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the person
who is the idea machine.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:90%
You know this person.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:84%
They're the one who
come up with ideas.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:84%
They are relentless
in their ideation.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:90%
They just have a million ideas.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:90%
They're the dazzler.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's at a really
important step in the process,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.410 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the end.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Having a lot of
ideas doesn't get you

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to a solution or a
solution that works.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:84%
What does are the next
two phases, which are,

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:90%
you take the idea.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:84%
You decide on the one
you want to move forward,

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and the designer takes it over.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And the designer is the
one who takes the idea

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:90%
and brings it to life.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:84%
They design it so that
it has effect and impact.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, there's
the creative driver.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And the creative driver in
the creative problem-solving

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:84%
process is the one
who makes it happen.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Any creative solution
is the result

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
of these four creative
preferences, these four

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:84%
creative superpowers,
if you will,

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and in the creative
problem-solving process.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
The chapter, "What is
Your Creative Superpower,"

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:90%
will explore this topic.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:84%
We will work together to
help define and identify

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:90%
your creative superpower.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And you will also be better
able to recognize other people's

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:90%
superpower.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: She knows what
she's talking about.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.793 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: She absolutely knows
what she's talking about.

00:11:21.793 --> 00:11:24.293 align:middle line:84%
She's also Head of Innovation
at York University in Toronto.

00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's impressive.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, it is.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is
it gets this discussion

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:84%
that she has here,
and in the book,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.695 align:middle line:84%
helps people understand
that everyone is creative.

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What kind
of criteria, Georgina,

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.285 align:middle line:84%
did you use to seek
out these experts?

00:11:41.285 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I wanted them
to be able to explain what

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:90%
they do in people language.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want it to be academic.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want scientific.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to be able to touch
the heart as well as the mind

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.250 align:middle line:84%
so that people could feel
safe exploring themselves.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, when you
explore yourself, as you know.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you've done it.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:90%
The work you do, you must have.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
It's challenging and a little
scary from time to time.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
you're going to find.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted
people to come across

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
as kind, understanding,
and accessible,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:84%
but also, in part, a knowledge
and a deep, experienced way

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.553 align:middle line:84%
of writing that people could
find useful in their life.

00:12:27.553 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What is birth order?

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I love this.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I used-- when I ran
a large organization,

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I used to hire on birth order.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Birth order--

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, really.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Birth order is where
you are in the hierarchy

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.413 align:middle line:84%
of you're the eldest or the
middle or the youngest child.

00:12:46.413 --> 00:12:47.455 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: In your family.

00:12:47.455 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.353 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's all?

00:12:49.353 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: That's
birth order, yes.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.853 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I was the first.

00:12:51.853 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: You were the first.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.625 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're the pioneer.

00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:84%
See, first-born
children, usually,

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:90%
are entrepreneurs, CEOs.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.842 align:middle line:84%
They are people that
break new ground because--

00:13:06.842 --> 00:13:07.675 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Seriously?

00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:08.475 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: --yeah.

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Because not only do you
learn to lead the way,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.160 align:middle line:84%
you also have parents who are
learning how to be parents.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
By the time the middle
child comes along,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.695 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere is
very different.

00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:23.735 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Big time.

00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Big time.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And the second child
is then the youngest

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:90%
until the third comes along.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the baby is the one
that is usually the charmer.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
By the way, most
entertainers, comedians,

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:43.790 align:middle line:84%
performers are babies of the
family, not all, of course,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:90%
but most.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So when I was hiring,
if I needed someone

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.940 align:middle line:84%
to do client service work,
if I had two people that

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
were exactly the same for
credibility, experience, et

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:84%
cetera, and I wanted them
to do client service work,

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.505 align:middle line:90%
I choose the baby of the family.

00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:01.395 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:14:01.395 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Really.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.438 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's fascinating.

00:14:03.438 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: If I wanted
someone to build business,

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I choose the firstborn,
everything else being equal.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is the
poor second person--

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: They're
very good negotiators.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Most politicians
are middle children.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Most successful politicians
are middle children.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, I
look at my family.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:90%
I was number one.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I have a sister
who was number two.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a third
sister, who has passed on,

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:90%
who was number three.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: And?

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They all fit.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.575 align:middle line:84%
I think we all fit the
categories you just described.

00:14:32.575 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:90%
It's uncanny.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.825 align:middle line:84%
I would say that 90%
of the time, it works.

00:14:37.825 --> 00:14:38.625 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And the
number-two person,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:84%
she's on social media all
the time even at her age,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
now, directing people and
doing this and doing that.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Exactly.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.027 align:middle line:90%
Mediators, very good mediators.

00:14:52.027 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who teaches them this?

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Hmm?

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.323 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who teaches them this?

00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: They learn how to
manage, how to be the middle,

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
how to be under the top
and work with that baby.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
The baby, by the way,
also, sometimes, you'll

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
find that the youngest
child always needs rescuing.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:84%
They are-- If they
are in trouble,

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:84%
they wait for someone
else to rescue them.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.078 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, the oldest child,
if they're in trouble,

00:15:18.078 --> 00:15:19.745 align:middle line:84%
usually, they find a
way out themselves.

00:15:19.745 --> 00:15:20.765 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: We do it ourselves.

00:15:20.765 --> 00:15:21.723 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's right.

00:15:21.723 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We don't
like to ask for help.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
You find that to be
the case too, right?

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I look at numerology, and I
look at astrology as well.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So number 8 is a
starter, someone

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.280 align:middle line:84%
who can be overpowering
if you're not careful,

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.263 align:middle line:84%
which I know that about myself
because that's part of it.

00:15:38.263 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is that you?

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.325 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Yeah, part
of being an Aries.

00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:44.855 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How does astrology
play into self-discovery?

00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It helps you
understand your strengths

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and weaknesses.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It helps you understand,
not only your strengths

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and weaknesses, but where
to put your energies.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you've been putting
your energies into life,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and it hasn't been
working, maybe that's

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.690 align:middle line:90%
the wrong path for you.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And astrology can help
you sort through that.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not the definitive answer
because we always have choice.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's be
real about this.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
There's no one way
of doing anything.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.455 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There's
free will here, right?

00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Your will.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:90%
We have free will, yeah.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, we
talked about palmistry.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Kathy Biehl, Lisa Greenfield
explained the harnessing power

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:90%
of astrology and palmistry.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.130 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
- The astrology chapter in
"Your Guide to Self Discovery"

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:84%
is designed to give you an
outsider's view or maybe

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
some more objectivity into your
sun sign and your rising sign

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:90%
if you know that.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
It helps you understand
your basic inclinations,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
the default behaviors
that you gravitate toward,

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and also, the challenges
that you may experience

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:90%
as a result of your wiring.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And one aspect of
it that's really

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
different for a
book of this nature

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:84%
is it helps you see how you are
perceived, how others see you,

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
not in a judgmental
way, but to give you

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
an understanding of why people
respond to you the way they do.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:84%
- I loved sharing about
the heart line in the book,

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:84%
although, it was
really hard to decide.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I went with the fact that the
heart line is the top line

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:90%
on your hand for a reason.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, granted, I mean, there's so
much information in your hands,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:84%
even where your
fingers sit, right?

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is formed by
what we think, feel, and act.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So as you think, feel,
and act in new ways,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:84%
it literally changes
the shape of your hands

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:90%
and those lines on them.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
But the heart, that's
the place where

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
it has the electromagnetic field
that it magnetizes in, I think,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.725 align:middle line:84%
something like 5,000 times
more than our thoughts do.

00:18:05.725 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's the top
line on the hand, which

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
is where, if we understand
how to align with that,

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
we can literally magnetize
in opportunities.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:90%
So why not start there, right?

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
All right, thanks for
the opportunity to share.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.775 align:middle line:84%
And by all means, go
see what's on hand.

00:18:23.775 --> 00:18:24.575 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Georgina,
what's the importance,

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and how do we align
with the heart?

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Huh.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
If you don't align
with the heart,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
you're always slightly
out step with yourself.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Some
people just say, I

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:84%
can't seem to get
traction in my life.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't seem--

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: --can't get going.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.245 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: --can't get going.

00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I do get going,
I keep slipping back.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like two steps
forward, and one step back,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.715 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not sure why.

00:18:49.715 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's because they're not in
alignment with who they truly

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:84%
are and understanding
who they are

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and where their strengths
and weaknesses are.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
understand, really,

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
what their
possibilities are, maybe

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.265 align:middle line:84%
because they've been brought
up, when they were young,

00:19:08.265 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
to always think that
they were a failure

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
or they'd never be
any good or maybe

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.315 align:middle line:84%
they just had a
tough early life.

00:19:15.315 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's become
like subtle self-talk

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:90%
that they don't recognize.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's where hypnosis
and regression helps.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But when you work through
these other modalities,

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:84%
they can then say themselves,
I've got possibilities here.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what I loved
about this concept.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
It shows the reader
they have possibilities

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to change and become
more than they

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.935 align:middle line:90%
know they thought they were.

00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The great American
prophet Edgar Cayce--

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Ah.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: --could read auras
of people, different colors

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
and different things.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he was
getting on an elevator

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:84%
on a 10th, 20th
floor of a building.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.800 align:middle line:84%
The door opened, and he
saw several people in there

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:90%
without any auras at all.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It scared the living
daylights out of him.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:90%
He did not go in the elevator.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:90%
He backed out.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:84%
The door closed, the
elevator cable snapped,

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and all these people
fell to their death.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:84%
By not seeing the aura, he
realized something was wrong.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's right.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:22.055 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, auras
have colors, don't they?

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, they do.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And today, by the way,
if we didn't see auras,

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.955 align:middle line:84%
we'd wonder if it was
people from another planet.

00:20:31.955 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.830 align:middle line:90%
Or from another dimension.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Because how we see auras is
in the electromagnetic energy

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that we emit on this planet at
this time in this environment.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But people who come from other
planets and other dimensions

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
have a different
energy frequency.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
So they don't necessarily
have the same auras.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.672 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do our
past lives fit into this?

00:21:01.672 --> 00:21:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Our past lives
show us what patterns

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:90%
we brought into this lifetime.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:90%
People call it karma.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I love about
karma is people blame karma

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:90%
for everything.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What goes
around comes around.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: That's right.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.103 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: But that's true.

00:21:16.103 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Sort of, kind of.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:17.615 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I think.

00:21:17.615 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Except I believe that
once you understand

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:84%
what you brought in with
you, if you don't like it,

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.110 align:middle line:90%
you can change it.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I'll give you
an example about karma.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:27.105 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Sure.

00:21:27.105 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I find
it very difficult

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
to walk past a homeless
person without giving them

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:84%
some amount of money,
not a lot, $5, $10, $20.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But I can't walk past
them and not help them.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:90%
It's just me.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, I do it from the heart.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't do it for any
gain or any recognition.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want
them to thank me.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:90%
I just do it.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Right.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But it
seems like every time

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I do something like that,
something happens, and it comes

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.630 align:middle line:90%
back to me 10- or 20-fold.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I gave a $20 several years
ago to a homeless guy,

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:84%
went to my PO box, and
there was a check for $1,500

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.040 align:middle line:84%
from my insurance company
that I didn't expect.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Very nice.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.352 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How does that happen?

00:22:11.352 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:10%
>>CANNON: I think it happens
because what we put out there

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.132 align:middle line:10%
gets magnified good or bad.

00:22:19.132 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who does it?

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.005 align:middle line:84%
Are we doing it, or is
there something else?

00:22:24.005 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: There's
something else.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.545 align:middle line:90%
It's a momentum.

00:22:28.545 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is it God?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: If you believe
in God, the Creator,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.430 align:middle line:90%
it's an energy of intention.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I do something very
similar, but it's different.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.415 align:middle line:90%
I do-- I drop quarters.

00:22:44.415 --> 00:22:46.515 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where
do you drop them?

00:22:46.515 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Everywhere,
in a parking lot.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You just drop them?

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I drop
them because what

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I want is for someone to say,
oh, look, I found a dime.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You hide and see
who's going to pick them up.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.945 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: No, no, no.

00:22:58.945 --> 00:23:02.110 align:middle line:84%
No, That's none of my--
that's not my business.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I just drop them
because I want someone

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:middle line:84%
to feel that that's
their lucky day.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I would probably
pick up a quarter.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.725 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Of course.

00:23:09.725 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Would you
pick up a penny?

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.065 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Of course.

00:23:13.065 --> 00:23:14.445 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Only
'cause it's there.

00:23:14.445 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Because it's there
and because it's a symbol of,

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:90%
look what I found.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.030 align:middle line:90%
It must be a lucky day.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So I do the same that
way as you do the same.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But what comes back, I
think, is just a blessing

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:90%
of how we live our life.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.100 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you
see a homeless person

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and want to give
them from your heart.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You're not doing it with
intent to get something back.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.502 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: You're
doing it because you

00:23:38.502 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:84%
feel it's the right thing
to do, and you feel empathy

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:90%
for that person.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel empathy
for that person,

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that spreads the light, if
you want to call it that.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And it comes back to
you in other ways.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There was a homeless
person who had a sign--

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:90%
"Please, I need food and water."

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And my producer
felt so bad for him,

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:84%
he went and got him food and
water and gave it to him.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And the guy said,
you cheapskate.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I want money.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work all the time.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I understand
why he did that.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.818 align:middle line:90%
He wanted choice.

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, don't hold
up the sign that says,

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.545 align:middle line:90%
give me food and money.

00:24:16.545 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a communication issue.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Exactly.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.548 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I'll go coach
him, communication issue.

00:24:23.548 --> 00:24:24.965 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are
dreams part of this?

00:24:24.965 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Dreams are a part of it.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:33.890 align:middle line:84%
We project, sometimes, our
fears, our wants and needs,

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.990 align:middle line:84%
our wishes into the
subconscious mind,

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we get that
information through dreams.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the dreams
are a manifestation

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.558 align:middle line:84%
of what is being unsaid
when we're awake.

00:24:46.558 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What about
recurring dreams

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.600 align:middle line:90%
that just happen over and over.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: That's
like a hello, hello.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:84%
You're not paying
attention to me here.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Before
something happens?

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.177 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Before something
happens or before we need

00:24:59.177 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:90%
to know something or before--

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:90%
it's not always bad news.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.995 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's just
information we need to know.

00:25:05.995 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, you know
Kelly Sullivan Walden--

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.003 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, I do.

00:25:09.003 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: --expert about
telling readers about dreams,

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and she talks about that.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Yeah,
she's in the book.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.905 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:15.705 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:84%
- Hello, George and Georgina,
it's Kelly Sullivan Walden,

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:90%
a.k.a.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Dream, and
I am so honored

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the authors
featured in Georgina's latest

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
book, "Your Guide
to Self Discovery."

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:84%
65% to 75% of adults report
having recurring dreams,

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and most of those people
report not knowing

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:90%
what to do with those dreams.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why, in chapter
3 of this book,

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I write about my best practices
and best recommendations

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:84%
for how to resolve
recurring dreams.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:90%
I share about my FEAR Formula.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.440 align:middle line:84%
This is a formula
for how to become

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.980 align:middle line:84%
transformed by your recurring
dream and/or recurring

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.570 align:middle line:90%
nightmare.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So by doing the
FEAR Formula, you

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:84%
learn to Face it, Embrace
it, Ace it, and Replace it.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's
happening in the dream,

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:84%
you learn to turn this
nightmare into a rightmare.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of doing this,

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:84%
you discover a hidden superpower
you didn't know you had.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And you also come to realize
that every single dream

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:84%
you have comes to
you in the service

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.045 align:middle line:84%
of your health, your
healing, and your wholeness.

00:26:27.045 --> 00:26:27.845 align:middle line:90%
Sweet dreams.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:84%
she writes because
she helps explain what

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:90%
we can learn from our dreams.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.940 align:middle line:84%
She helps explain how it can
make us better understand

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.263 align:middle line:84%
ourselves and grow and flourish,
particularly around nightmares

00:26:47.263 --> 00:26:49.055 align:middle line:84%
because people get
scared about nightmares.

00:26:49.055 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Big time.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And she helps us
understand, in a very pragmatic

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:90%
way, that it's not the end.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the beginning of learning
and understanding and growth.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.345 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I love about her.

00:27:02.345 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you have to be
a believer for any of this

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:90%
to work?

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.803 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: When I'm asked that
question, I say, do the work,

00:27:08.803 --> 00:27:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and then tell me
if you believe it

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.212 align:middle line:84%
or not because you'll
notice the change.

00:27:13.212 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Big time.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Back to karma
for a moment, Georgina.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.695 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do
you think of it?

00:27:19.695 --> 00:27:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I think it's a
bit like being a mother.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Everybody blames
karma for everything,

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.970 align:middle line:84%
like people blame their
mother for everything.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But what happens with karma
is when you bring something

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:84%
into this life, it teaches
you, if you're listening to it,

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:84%
what you can make
change and how you

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:84%
can make change to make
your life richer and better.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So I came into this
current life as a victim.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd had many lives as a
victim, and my early life

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:90%
was not very pleasant.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But at one point,
I had to decide,

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.580 align:middle line:84%
am I going to stay a
victim or be a hero?

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand
the pattern or the karma

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:84%
you've brought in, then
you can choose your life

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.993 align:middle line:84%
and how to make change and
make it richer, fuller,

00:28:05.993 --> 00:28:07.285 align:middle line:90%
and more beneficial, generally.

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you teach this
in your "Self Discovery" book?

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I do, indeed.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Should parents
use this for their kids?

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Kids understand
this more than adults do.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Why?

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Because they
haven't lost their connection

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:84%
to spirituality,
especially early teens.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I find early teens
really understand

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.420 align:middle line:84%
there is more than what
they're taught in school.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:84%
There's more than what their
parents have told them.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
There's more out there
that they have yet

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.190 align:middle line:90%
to discover about themselves.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we get so
much pushback, quite often.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't know why
they're pushing back,

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.870 align:middle line:84%
but they know they're
pushing back for a reason.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.512 align:middle line:84%
And this book certainly
will help them.

00:28:52.512 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are
some of the techniques

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.850 align:middle line:84%
that you would recommend to
people to change their karma,

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:90%
to change their life?

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.042 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: A
past-life regression.

00:29:02.042 --> 00:29:04.000 align:middle line:84%
First of all, then you
would learn the patterns

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.800 align:middle line:90%
that you brought in with you.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Know what your numbers are.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Know what your creativity
is so that you understand

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.100 align:middle line:84%
where your ideas come from and
how you might use them best.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And those ideas can
be in the kitchen,

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.140 align:middle line:84%
they can be in
the artist studio,

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:90%
or they can be in business.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.188 align:middle line:84%
Being creative isn't
restricted to any one genre.

00:29:27.188 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's wide open.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It's wide
open to life, right?

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:90%
There are others-- face reading.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Face reading tells you
a lot about a person.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.445 align:middle line:84%
That's also a
chapter in the book.

00:29:39.445 --> 00:29:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That would be
an intriguing segment,

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:90%
face reading.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:84%
You can tell somebody's
mood, their character,

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Character by the
placement of their eyes,

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.615 align:middle line:90%
placement of their eyebrows--

00:29:49.615 --> 00:29:51.115 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The way
they look, smile--

00:29:51.115 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: --the way
they smile, placement

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:90%
of their bone structure.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, not all of it is genetic.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.575 align:middle line:90%
Threats, you call SWOT.

00:30:02.575 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: SWOT.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's used a lot in corporate
language for people

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.870 align:middle line:84%
to find out what their
corporate strengths are

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:12.070 align:middle line:90%
and weaknesses are.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, when people go for
interviews for senior jobs,

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:21.640 align:middle line:84%
they're given a test for their
strengths and weaknesses.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.350 align:middle line:90%
But you can use it for yourself.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Because once you understand
what your weaknesses are,

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.450 align:middle line:84%
then you can find out more
about your strengths as well.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can put more energy
towards your strengths

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.715 align:middle line:84%
and not so much focus
on your weaknesses.

00:30:37.715 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, when people say,
oh, I wish I could sing.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I keep trying to sing,
or I wish I was musical.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.682 align:middle line:90%
Instead of worrying about that--

00:30:46.682 --> 00:30:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: --just do it.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Not like to do it.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.430 align:middle line:84%
But what about what
you're good at?

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:84%
How about if you're
good at dancing,

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:84%
or you're good at something
else like painting?

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Then why not put
all your energies

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.090 align:middle line:90%
into what you're good at.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: See, I'm convinced
you can be good at anything

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.140 align:middle line:90%
you apply yourself to.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: You can be good
but not necessarily brilliant

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.685 align:middle line:90%
at it, I would say to you.

00:31:06.685 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It depends
on who you are.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.243 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It depends
on your natural talent.

00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:11.815 align:middle line:84%
You know, some
people are born being

00:31:11.815 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:84%
able to play the
piano although there's

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.986 align:middle line:90%
no musician in the family.

00:31:15.986 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I couldn't play
the clarinet in high school

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:90%
if I wanted to.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: And now?

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:20.995 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: But I could sing.

00:31:20.995 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Do you still sing?

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Absolutely,
live shows.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.540 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like fun.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a hobby.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But put a clarinet in
my hand or a guitar

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:90%
and say, strum it and play it.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.195 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do that.

00:31:33.195 --> 00:31:34.645 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: But you've
got an ear for voice.

00:31:34.645 --> 00:31:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But I have
an ear for voice.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.542 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Oh, that's fantastic.

00:31:37.542 --> 00:31:38.920 align:middle line:90%
What a gift that is.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, next time around,
I want that gift.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a gift.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.373 align:middle line:90%
So what do you sing?

00:31:43.373 --> 00:31:44.665 align:middle line:90%
What sort of music do you sing?

00:31:44.665 --> 00:31:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Old stuff--

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Elvis Presley, Sinatra.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.705 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Oh, Sinatra.

00:31:49.705 --> 00:31:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Tony Bennett?

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I left my
heart in San Francisco.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.582 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:31:55.582 --> 00:31:56.915 align:middle line:90%
Could you give us a little song?

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: There's no music here.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: We could get it.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You have to
come to my live shows.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.815 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: I'd love that.

00:32:03.815 --> 00:32:04.615 align:middle line:90%
That'd be great.

00:32:04.615 --> 00:32:07.785 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But anyway, let's
talk about Kim Caughlin.

00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:08.585 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:32:08.585 --> 00:32:09.935 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who is Kim Caughlin?

00:32:09.935 --> 00:32:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Kim is
a corporate coach,

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and she shines with positive
energy and creativity

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:27.595 align:middle line:84%
and kindness and a
sense of direction.

00:32:27.595 --> 00:32:29.560 align:middle line:84%
She's the sort of
person that can

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.480 align:middle line:84%
see the leaf on the
branch of the tree

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:90%
and helps you get there.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So she's an expert
on your theory of SWOT.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at her.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.150 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.310 align:middle line:84%
- The SWOT analysis, when
applied to a personal goal,

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:46.570 align:middle line:84%
is a powerful way to
foster self-reflection,

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:84%
to set intentionality, and to
drive action towards a goal

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:90%
of your choosing.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be a career
or a health goal,

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:00.880 align:middle line:84%
you can use the SWOT
analysis to really accelerate

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.960 align:middle line:84%
your understanding of
how to achieve the goal

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.690 align:middle line:90%
and what actions are best taken.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:90%
SWOT is an acronym.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It stands for Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities,

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.930 align:middle line:90%
and Threats.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, what strengths do
you have attached to your goal?

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.260 align:middle line:84%
What weaknesses or
areas or traits that

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:84%
are holding you back
from achieving that goal?

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:84%
What are some opportunities
that are out there

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:90%
to achieve your dreams?

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And what are some threats
that might be holding you back

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.760 align:middle line:84%
from accelerating
towards this goal?

[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.745 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You really have some
great experts in this book.

00:34:01.745 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Oh, they are amazing.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Good job.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.793 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah, thank you.

00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I didn't only want
brains, I wanted heart too.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And you can see.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you
could tell there's

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.230 align:middle line:84%
a lot of heart
behind these people.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's so important.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.659 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What results have
you seen in people change,

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:19.070 align:middle line:90%
where you went--

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.290 align:middle line:84%
they were difficult
in the beginning,

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and then toward the end,
they were pretty remarkable.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: I've seen
some remarkable change.

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:30.889 align:middle line:84%
I've been working in the clinic,
hypnosis clinic for over 23

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:32.500 align:middle line:90%
years now.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And as well as doing
hypnosis and NLP,

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.430 align:middle line:90%
I also coach and teach.

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen,
particularly in classes

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:42.690 align:middle line:84%
where I teach, people
come in because they

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.040 align:middle line:90%
practice in the class.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And the manifestation of the
lessons they learn changes

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.050 align:middle line:90%
lives.

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:90%
They find more self-confidence.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:84%
They understand how to set
goals that they can achieve.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.160 align:middle line:84%
They understand how to manage
their anger or irritation

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:90%
or let go of it.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:90%
And they understand that--

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:84%
big learning, I
find, with people is

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.760 align:middle line:84%
they expect people to
understand and appreciate them.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So how about you
understanding and appreciate

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.020 align:middle line:90%
the other person?

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.385 align:middle line:90%
And let them be what they are.

00:35:14.385 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you seen
people, Georgina, get very

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.030 align:middle line:90%
emotional with all of this?

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.115 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: All the time.

00:35:19.115 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They break down?

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:90%
They cry?

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:21.818 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: All the time.

00:35:21.818 --> 00:35:24.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for any
session I do, online,

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I say make sure you have
a box of Kleenex with you.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm looking
for is the aha in the eyes.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times, it's
just the questions I ask.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:40.350 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly, oh,
oh, now I understand.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.638 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:35:42.638 --> 00:35:44.055 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We do
it at our events--

00:35:44.055 --> 00:35:45.097 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's beautiful.

00:35:45.097 --> 00:35:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: --live events,
four of them every year.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
first things we do

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.480 align:middle line:84%
is we pay tribute to our first
responders and our military,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.957 align:middle line:90%
past and present.

00:35:54.957 --> 00:35:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have a band
there playing "When

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Johnny Comes Marching Home,"
and it's just pretty dramatic.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But I break up
almost all the time we do it.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm on stage, almost
in tears, standing

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.120 align:middle line:84%
in front of all these
people like a little baby.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It shows your heart.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is that what that is?

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: It shows your
heart and your soul,

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.760 align:middle line:84%
not just your heart,
but it shows your soul,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that you are feeling
gratitude, immense gratitude

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
what they went through

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.470 align:middle line:90%
and what they stand for.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's what that is.

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And I asked
them to stand if they can.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And let me rephrase
what I'm meant by that.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I was in Norfolk,
Virginia, a couple

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:90%
of years ago at a live event.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And I had an opening skit in
front of these military people

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.460 align:middle line:84%
where, with a blanket, I can
make my leg disappear and come

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.260 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.860 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing illusion.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And I'm ready
to do this on stage,

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.280 align:middle line:84%
there's 400 people
in the theater,

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and I look in the front row has
got all these veterans without

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.450 align:middle line:84%
legs who had lost
them in their action--

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Vietnam primarily,
maybe Afghanistan.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do the thing.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:13.910 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.285 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
inappropriate.

00:37:15.285 --> 00:37:16.165 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, yes.

00:37:16.165 --> 00:37:19.075 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Thank God I
realized that at that time.

00:37:19.075 --> 00:37:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: You realized it
because it comes from here.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:90%
You weren't acting from here.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.525 align:middle line:84%
You realized it because
of your empathy.

00:37:27.525 --> 00:37:29.295 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's the
heart that stopped me.

00:37:29.295 --> 00:37:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes, right.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do people
evaluate where they're headed,

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:84%
or do they have to go to
someone like you for the advice?

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:43.182 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: They, first of all,
need to know they want help--

00:37:43.182 --> 00:37:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They have to
realize that themselves?

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: --have to
realize they want help.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And they have to realize
that it takes courage.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And I always
acknowledge the courage

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.040 align:middle line:90%
that it takes to change.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we move at
the speed of pain

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:07.930 align:middle line:84%
until that pain gets unbearable,
then we put up with stuff.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.630 align:middle line:84%
When we can't put up
with stuff anymore,

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.570 align:middle line:84%
whether it be our own
stuff or stuff around us,

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:16.900 align:middle line:84%
then we seek help,
whether it be help

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:21.560 align:middle line:84%
of leaving a
partnership in business,

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.990 align:middle line:84%
a marriage, a relationship,
or help with friendships,

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:90%
or help with self.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.610 align:middle line:84%
If the pain is
unbearable, then we

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:84%
seek change because
change isn't easy,

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.110 align:middle line:90%
but it takes determination.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.085 align:middle line:90%
It takes commitment.

00:38:36.085 --> 00:38:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Guts?

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Guts?

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.400 align:middle line:90%
For sure, guts.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.995 align:middle line:84%
Because we're moving
from what we know,

00:38:41.995 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:84%
as painful it is,
to the unknown.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why hypnosis
helps because we

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.200 align:middle line:84%
can do what we call future
pacing, which you can imagine

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.535 align:middle line:90%
what your life will be like.

00:38:51.535 --> 00:38:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Does somebody
remember under hypnosis

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.005 align:middle line:90%
what they've just told you?

00:38:56.005 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, totally.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They do remember that.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.275 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: Oh, they
remember everything.

00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So it's not like
you have to play a tape back

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:01.800 align:middle line:90%
for them to hear.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.675 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: No, no, no.

00:39:02.675 --> 00:39:03.867 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:39:03.867 --> 00:39:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, people
are concerned what's

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:06.698 align:middle line:90%
going to happen in hypnosis.

00:39:06.698 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
going to levitate,

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.710 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to bark like
a dog or quack like a duck

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:11.510 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.795 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Exactly.

00:39:11.795 --> 00:39:12.595 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: Yeah.

00:39:12.595 --> 00:39:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And no, no, not at all.

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:90%
They're in control all the time.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And should they wish to,
they can bring themselves out

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of hypnosis.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The old TV
shows were the hypnotist

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.030 align:middle line:84%
would make people do that,
quack like a duck and stuff,

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.830 align:middle line:90%
was that real?

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CANNON: It's real.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But remember, the client,
the person in hypnosis

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:32.040 align:middle line:90%
is always in control.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.340 align:middle line:84%
