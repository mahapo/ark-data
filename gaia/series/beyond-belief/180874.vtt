00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we have
a very special guest today, who

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:10%
is one of the giants of the
UFO field, Grant Cameron,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:10%
noted author, researcher.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:10%
He has been a recipient
of numerous awards,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:10%
and his latest book is called
"Tuned In: the Paranormal

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.520 align:middle line:10%
World of Music."

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, this has to
do with his theory

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.220 align:middle line:10%
of how aliens have
influenced the music

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:10%
community and musicians.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Grant, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRANT CAMERON: Thanks
for having me on, George.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm honored.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you come to
write this book, "Tuned In"?

00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: A very bizarre story,
I got a message from an alien.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I got a
message from an alien.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.308 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:01:03.308 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: What
happened was I had

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.280 align:middle line:10%
been friends with an experiencer
by the name of Chris Bledsoe.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:10%
Chris has been
interacting with--

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:10%
military intelligence
is watching him--

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.350 align:middle line:10%
Military, NASA people,
White House, people.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.874 align:middle line:84%
He's sort of got a
high level of contact,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's why
they're interested.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:90%
I met him in 2012.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.620 align:middle line:84%
In 2013, I had a very
bizarre experience with him.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.111 align:middle line:84%
So whatever he said, I
listened very carefully

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:84%
because I knew he
had these contacts

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and that people are
taken him very seriously.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
He phoned me up one
day, and he said,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I've got a message
from the Guardians.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Guardians were
what he called the beings

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:90%
that he was interacting with.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
appear in a crop circle.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
In 2002, at Crabwood crop
circle is what it's called,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.001 align:middle line:84%
there was a being that
appeared with a binary message.

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was a big story.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: It was
a big story I get

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
this message from Chris Bledsoe,
this famous experiencer.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, Grant, I got
a message from the Guardians.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:84%
So, again I was--
anything he talks about,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:90%
I listened carefully.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK,
you got a message.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:10%
He said, they want you to know
the message is in the music.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
well, Chris, you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:90%
may be talking to the wrong guy.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:90%
My whole family is musical.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I've never listened to music.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't care about music.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.636 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm
a UFO researcher.

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, I'm-- and
so it meant nothing to me.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.517 align:middle line:84%
And then he kept
talking, and he said,

00:02:32.517 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:90%
there's a couple of songs.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:84%
He told his bizarre
story about some CDs

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.469 align:middle line:84%
that appeared in
his car or whatever.

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, the two songs
you should listen to his one,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:90%
is "Kashmir," by Led Zeppelin.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.409 align:middle line:84%
And I went, whatever,
Chris, you know.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:84%
It still doesn't
mean anything to me.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.326 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not, your
kind of music.

00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I'm not into
music, never listened

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.327 align:middle line:90%
to music in my life.

00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, oh,
and the other song you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:84%
should listen to, and this is
where they threw the hook in.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.163 align:middle line:10%
He said, the other song
you should listen to

00:02:57.163 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:10%
is a song called "After the
Gold Rush" by Neil Young.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:10%
And I said, Neil Young?

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:10%
It was Neil Young?

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:10%
You think young Neil
Young is involved?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.049 align:middle line:84%
And I live in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, Canada,

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:84%
which is famous for
nothing except a number

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.997 align:middle line:84%
of famous musicians
came out of Winnipeg.

00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And hockey.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: And hockey.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And hockey.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.446 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: And hockey.

00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But Neil Young grew up in
Winnipeg, and so when he said,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Neil Young.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:90%
I said Neil Young's involved?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
reason I pursued it.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Then when I looked up the lyrics
for "After the Gold Rush,"

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:84%
it basically is a song that
basically is sort of a story

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that the UFO experiencers
tell, the people,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
39% of all experiencers say
when they're board the ship,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
they're showing these sort of
images, catastrophic images,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:90%
on the screen.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.766 align:middle line:84%
And in the song, it
basically, to put it short,

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
it says, we're
treating the world

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
like a gold rush,
when the gold is gone,

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
the silver seeds, the flying
saucers, are going to come,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to take the chosen

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:90%
ones to a new home in the sun.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:90%
And I was hooked.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I went, whoa, I mean,
this bizarre thing.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So I started to look at it, and,
you know, I wasn't into music.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:90%
I started looking at it.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered a
book by Michael Luckman.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
interviewed him.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, we sure have.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: "Alien Rock."

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: And when I saw
the book "Alien Rock,"

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:10%
which is 330 pages of musicians
and their interest in UFOs

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:10%
and how many had UFO
sightings, I went, wow,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:10%
there's something to this.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:90%
And I started--

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I started-- that's how I started
to study the whole thing.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.241 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long have you
been investigating UFOs now?

00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: 43 years,
and it was only

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple of years
that I did the music thing,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and so that's why
it was so bizarre.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was almost--

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.856 align:middle line:84%
almost like I was chosen
to do this because I

00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:30.105 align:middle line:90%
don't have a dog in the fight.

00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a musician.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.065 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any interest--

00:04:32.065 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
involved in UFOs 40 years ago?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.276 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: A sighting.

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I had a sighting that
there was a town called

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Carman, Manitoba, which
was 25 miles north

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:90%
of the American border.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.394 align:middle line:84%
And they were seeing
UFOs there all the time.

00:04:44.394 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just went out because
everybody was seeing it.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:90%
I had no interest in UFOs.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this UFO, and that's
what got me interested in UFOs.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, your reputation
in the UFO community is huge.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you were asked
in 2013 to testify

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:84%
as part of the citizens
hearing on disclosure.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: My name
is Grant Cameron.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm a private investigator.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:10%
For the past 38 years,
I have attempted

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:10%
to focus on what the
highest levels of the US

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:10%
government, military,
and intelligence agencies

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:10%
know about the UFO phenomena.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm the director of the
president's UFO website.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.726 align:middle line:84%
As Steve Bassett mentioned,
the Obama administration

00:05:24.726 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
has come out with an
official statement

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
saying there is no ET evidence
for an interaction with ETs.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:90%
And there is no cover up.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
What I would like to do
based on my years of research

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
is present a few
pieces of evidence

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
which show that this statement
written by a low-level White

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:84%
House staffer is ill
informed and not true.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
During a visit to Roswell,
New Mexico in 2012,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
President Obama referred
to the White House--

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to the Roswell
crash saying, we're

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.656 align:middle line:90%
going to keep our secrets here.

00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:84%
This raises the
question in light

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:84%
of the statement put
out by his office

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:90%
that there is no ET cover up.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
What secrets is President
Obama referring to?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you
think of that hearing?

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I think
it was fantastic.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.145 align:middle line:84%
I think it opened the door to
giving it some credibility.

00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Credibility.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.605 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And a number of
major, major researchers

00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
were all brought
together and got

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to tell what is the
best evidence we have.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
there were people

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
that were heavy hitters
in the UFO community.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I saw Linda
Moulton Howe there.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
The late Roger Leir
was sitting behind you.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These folks really
devoted their careers

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:90%
to ufology, didn't they?

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, so
it went a long way

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
to clarifying the fact that
there is some solid evidence

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and putting it out there
where you can actually

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
go back and look at this
stuff, for example, you know,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.810 align:middle line:90%
the Rendlesham.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:90%
It was a big case.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge case.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.073 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Where
they actually started

00:06:53.073 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to make a move when one of
the people on the panel,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
one of these congressmen
and senators,

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:84%
suddenly realized they
were running the veteran's

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.290 align:middle line:84%
They were sort of responsible
for the congressional part,

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't realize
what was going on.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So some of the-- there
was some big, big moves

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.499 align:middle line:90%
made by that disclosure.

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Grant, how did
you go from investigating

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.164 align:middle line:84%
the president's involvement
in UFOs to music in UFOs?

00:07:15.164 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well,
it's a long trip.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I had my sighting, which led me
to try to publish a book, which

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:90%
nobody would publish.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, well, I'm
not interested in sightings

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm just interested in
who knows what I saw.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has to know what I saw.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I chased
the Canadian government.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why I chased the
president of the United States

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and high-level CIA
people, figuring

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that one of these people
has to know what I saw,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and that led me to this thing
of doing documents of what

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.187 align:middle line:84%
the president said,
and then in 2012,

00:07:44.187 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:90%
I have this download experience.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I have this sort of
consciousness download

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
shift and realize

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
this is the answer
I've been looking for.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It's got to do
with consciousness.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the music
came after that.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And the music is linked to
the consciousness thing.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I got
to the music thing.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.063 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There were
a lot of musicians

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
who have been influenced
by UFOs, lots of people.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.822 align:middle line:10%
Sammy Hagar is one of them.

00:08:05.822 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: Staggering number.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:10%
A whole series of them have had
UFO sightings, Olivia Newton

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:10%
John, two of the Rolling Stones,
Elvis Presley, Sammy Davis

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:10%
Junior, and a lot of musicians
see not just one UFO,

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:10%
they see multiple
UFOs, Billy Ray Cyrus.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ongoing?

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Ongoing?

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: No, and, like, a
lot of people see one UFO,

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of musicians, for
example, Billy Ray Cyrus,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
saw five of them and
actually took a photograph

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:90%
and put it on Twitter.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And you had one of the members
of The Moody Blues actually

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
stated that he, during a
rehearsal in 1973 in Brazil,

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:84%
had seen a fleet of
UFOs, thousands of them,

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:84%
like a freeway of UFOs
flying over as they came out

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:90%
of a practice session.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So musicians have had a lot,
and it's just-- it's staggering.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:90%
At one point.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.878 align:middle line:84%
I thought they had
every single musician.

00:09:01.878 --> 00:09:03.955 align:middle line:84%
I figured, like, every
single one because one--

00:09:03.955 --> 00:09:04.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: One of the things
I had looked at was when I saw

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
the number who were
experiencers who had described--

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.514 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
they were abductees,

00:09:12.514 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I wonder-- because
one of the big bands that

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.555 align:middle line:84%
came out of Winnipeg
was The Guess Who,

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that wrote "American
Woman," and very

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:90%
famous during the late '60s.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
The head of that, I
looked at him, and I said,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what he had.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I took his name, and I
put it in with alien abduction,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and his Facebook page popped up.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:90%
And on there, he's in caps.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So he's sort of yelling
on his Facebook page.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm 64 years old.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.827 align:middle line:90%
I'll say whatever I want to say.

00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're mistreating Whitley
Strieber, and I'm going, well,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.073 align:middle line:84%
his Facebook people
aren't going to know

00:09:41.073 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:90%
who Whitley Strieber is.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Why is he talking
about Whitley Strieber.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, I know
exactly how he feels.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:90%
At that point, I thought, wow!

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.131 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they've got everybody.

00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So there was this--
this connection,

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.254 align:middle line:84%
and the more I looked
at it, the more I

00:09:51.254 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
realized that there
was piles of musicians

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.554 align:middle line:84%
that have had experiences,
have written songs about it,

00:09:57.554 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:90%
have put it on their albums.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
For example, you'd get
people who put albums,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
but the musicians, we had three
dozen or more albums where

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
they put UFOs on the
cover or stuff like that,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:84%
a number of musicians
who actually

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:84%
believed that they weren't from
this planet, like John Denver.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
John Denver actually said
at one point, he said,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I have an affinity for
the constellation Lyra.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.925 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a song
called "The Spirit."

00:10:23.925 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And it was
released after he--

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He thought it
was from that region, huh?

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And he-- after he
died, this song was released.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
But the guy who wrote
the lyrics to the song

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
said, John Denver did not
just sort of think about that.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:84%
He actually believed he
may have been from there.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was other
musicians that believed

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:90%
that they weren't from here.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
The first woman to sing
on "Saturday Night Live,"

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Patti Smith.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And she's on the
tape where she said,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like I was
dropped into this planet.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:90%
I feel I'm from somewhere else.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.240 align:middle line:10%
And she'd have these
very bizarre things

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:10%
of how many had UFOs over their
concerts, Bono, Ozzy Osbourne--

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tom DeLonge.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Springfield,
Tom DeLonge.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From Blink 182.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And
this is the thing,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
you have these musicians,
and the more you look at it,

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
the more you realize that there
is this bizarre connection,

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.719 align:middle line:84%
and it's linked
to consciousness.

00:11:11.719 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think they might have

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.567 align:middle line:84%
been reincarnated from some
extraterrestrial presence?

00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, I
think reincarnation

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is a big thing we've got to
look at in the UFO community.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.898 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking
for UFO disclosure.

00:11:21.898 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think we should look
at reincarnation disclosure.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I think there's almost as much
evidence for reincarnation

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:90%
as there is for UFOs.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And if we can establish the fact
that there is reincarnation,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:90%
then everything changes.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:90%
So you have one life.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Then it's one world.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But if it's multiple lives,
then it's multiple worlds.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So it comes down to, why
are we here on Earth?

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
What are we supposed
to be doing?

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And you start
looking at musicians

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
where they may be
here just to do this,

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:84%
to get some sort of message
across, to do some sort of work

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.507 align:middle line:84%
in terms of raising
consciousness on the Earth.

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So back to this
reincarnation connection,

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Grant, because I think it's
very possible that some

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
of these musicians who have
obtained some incredible talent

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:84%
might have been
helped that way too.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, and this is
the whole deal about especially

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:90%
with savants.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:90%
I did some work on savants.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.953 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: As to where
did they get it from,

00:12:16.953 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:84%
and you start looking at this
idea of a field or the fact

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.826 align:middle line:84%
that somebody is coming into
this world to replay something

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.200 align:middle line:84%
they've done before
and that some

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:84%
of those famous
musicians from the past

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
may be musicians in this world
doing the same thing they

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:90%
did in past lives.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.016 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the motive is

00:12:33.016 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
to influence

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.209 align:middle line:90%
the artist through music.

00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I think
it's all got to do

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.875 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness raising.

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:84%
The more I look
at UFOs, I believe

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:90%
it's got to do with messaging.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:84%
It's got to do with
raising consciousness.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe
it's no different

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
than a lot of musicians believe
that they're getting stuff

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
from angels, like
one of the musicians

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
believed he was getting stuff
from the Archangel Metatron.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And so you get these
kind of things where--

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:84%
the way I describe it is you
know the famous channeler,

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
alien channeler in
Los Angeles, Bashar?

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.583 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Bashar talks about
it, and it fits into this.

00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:90%
He said, there is only light.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Darkness is not a
thing unto itself.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's only light
and information.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And darkness, the farther
you're away from the light,

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:84%
the darker it gets, and the
less information you have.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.502 align:middle line:84%
So the way I look
at it is it's as

00:13:29.502 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:84%
if we're at the
bottom of the ocean

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:90%
where it's very, very dark.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And we think this
is all there is.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And musicians are very sort
of right brained, for example,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:84%
you have-- you mentioned
Roger Lear before.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Roger Lear was asked about
his 17 implants that he did.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:84%
What's the common
characteristics

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:90%
of all experiences?

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they're all
right brain creative people.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:90%
And so you have this--

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.525 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: You have this
thing with musicians

00:13:51.525 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
that musicians are in sort of
in-- we're in the darkness.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Musicians are like
other people--

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.980 align:middle line:84%
some people who are able to
what I call disassociate.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
They're able to sort of shut
down the left brain ego mind,

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:90%
quiet that part of the mind.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Their right brain sort
of gets into the field.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So they float up
from the darkness

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:84%
into closer to the light
where you can see more.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:90%
You can pick up stuff.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And they pick up this stuff,
and they bring it back

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.904 align:middle line:90%
into the darkness.

00:14:18.904 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And this happens actually
with inventions too.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.640 align:middle line:84%
If you take a look
at, for example,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:84%
the scientific method,
the periodic table,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:90%
the atomic atom.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.236 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: All these things
came in download things.

00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about the 3.14 pi,
which has a musical tone to it

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.920 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, And
that's the thing.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.308 align:middle line:84%
So these people
are disassociating.

00:14:40.308 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:84%
They're going up sort
of into a lighter

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%
thing where they can see more.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're able
to come back down.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like UFO experiencers.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the Free
Foundation research,

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.950 align:middle line:84%
it shows that 42%
of all experiencers

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
say that they have mathematical,
technical, or scientific

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:90%
material in their head--

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.568 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --that they
did not learn in school.

00:14:58.568 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And 40% of all experiencers
say at one point

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
during their experience, they
knew the answer to everything

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:90%
in the Universe.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what's also
fascinating, Grant, not only

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:84%
have some of these
musicians been influenced

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
by some kind of UFO or
extraterrestrial involvement,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
but that the
musicians themselves

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:90%
are fascinated with ufology.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a big way too.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
They have a thing, and at one
time, people would say to me,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's just because
people are interested in it.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And I actually did
a thing one time

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.317 align:middle line:84%
I was doing, where
Bubba Watson golfs,

00:15:31.317 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to do a
lecture at this golf club.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And I went in
there, and I said, well,

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I'll just do a thing where I get
some golfer who's been abducted

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:90%
or had a UFO sighting.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Could not find a single one.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:90%
But you put a musician, and--

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
all over the place.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And your
screen will light up.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's that pervasive,
and just nobody has studied it.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Music,
historically, has been used

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:90%
for altered states of mind.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a Gaia show
called "Psychedelica,"

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:90%
which highlights that.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:10%
>>JONATHAN GOLDMAN:
Music And sound

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:10%
can not only enhance
psychedelic journeys,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:10%
but can initiate
psychedelic experiences

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:10%
without anything else.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:10%
There are many traditions
throughout the planet

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:10%
that in order to enter altered
states of being will simply

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:10%
use sound, whether it is their
voice, or drumming, or bowls,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.560 align:middle line:10%
or bells, or some sort
of other instrumentation.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:84%
This basically alters
all sorts of aspects

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and
our consciousness.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:84%
The instruments
that have been used

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.190 align:middle line:84%
to achieve altered
states of consciousness

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.490 align:middle line:84%
have been multitude,
myriad, and many.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most
popular, of course,

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
has been the voice,
shaman, and priests,

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and various types
of practitioners

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
using different mantras,
making different tones,

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:84%
speaking in different tongues,
altering different states

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
literally, shifting

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational
frequencies of this space

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:84%
within and without
using their own voice.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible that
the extraterrestrial involvement

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:84%
with the music is being
done for a certain reason?

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.079 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying
to accomplish?

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.059 align:middle line:84%
It's not just to have
the musician mention UFOs

00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:90%
in the song.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:84%
There's gotta be
something else here.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, as
would do the orig--

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:84%
the original message to me was
the message is in the music.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:90%
I think it's like-- like TV.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like this
subliminal message.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:90%
So it'll be tone.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle line:90%
It'll be lyrics.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It'll be-- and
it's-- it's this--

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
the messages are similar,
the oneness, love,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
these kind of messages, same
sort of messages you get.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are the
ones ingrained in the song?

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the tone
that is-- was described here,

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
that the tone is-- is got
messages in it as well.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.962 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the lyrics.

00:17:53.962 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
doing it as a way

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.540 align:middle line:84%
to subliminally, as
you mentioned, but let

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.484 align:middle line:90%
us know that they're here?

00:18:00.484 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yes, that--

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they trying
to tell us something?

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: That's part of it.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.807 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is
the idea of oneness.

00:18:04.807 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of the main
messages that they have is this

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
oneness that everything
is connected,

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's to move us-- we're
sort of moving out of this dark

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
water into higher water, and
they're trying to lead us

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:90%
in that way, the same as--

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:90%
it's not just UF--

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:90%
aliens.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear stories about
spirits and a famous story

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:90%
was told about--

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:84%
a guy by the name of
Stuart Sharp, who wrote

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.440 align:middle line:84%
called the "Angeli
Symphony." and he

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
was had these encounters with
what he called the Snow People.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And his first-born son--

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
his first son died, and the
night after he had the funeral,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.060 align:middle line:90%
he had a dream.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, he sort
of described it like angels,

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
but there have these
Snow People that

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:84%
appeared when he was
young, said, sometimes when

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:84%
this happens, we give
the person a gift,

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and they gave him this song
called the "Angeli Symphony."

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.237 align:middle line:84%
And this guy, it took him 20
years to put this together.

00:19:02.237 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:84%
He had to raise over
a million pounds,

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and the London
Philharmonic Orchestra

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
played this thing, this
song that was in his head,

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.970 align:middle line:84%
for 20 years, and
it was the only time

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:84%
the London Philharmonic
Orchestra ever stood

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
up and applauded the
guy who composed it.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
bizarre stories

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.797 align:middle line:84%
where you have this interlink,
whether it's aliens--

00:19:18.797 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I think they're all
in the same field.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Once you move out
of the darkness,

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.148 align:middle line:90%
that's where everybody lives.

00:19:23.148 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Like Bashar, the same thing.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Bashar said, the aliens-- we
come to you in your dreams

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
because, now,
you're in our world.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
aliens are sort of

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:84%
in that world with
spirits, with ghosts,

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:90%
with angels, this sort of thing.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:84%
They're able to come into our
world and then go back again.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:84%
So-- and if we can disassociate
and get out of that field,

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:90%
they mentioned sound here.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I've written a paper on 25
methods to disassociate.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:90%
You can use hypnosis.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 25?

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.043 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: You can use hypnosis.

00:19:51.043 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
You can use meditation,
psychedelic drugs.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of
methods that people--

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:90%
brain injuries, pain.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Here you mentioned
drumming, bowls, prayer.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Christians have used
prayer for centuries

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to disassociate, to talk to
God, where you sort of just pop

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:84%
out and are able to
dissociate, to shut down

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:84%
the neurocortex, the left brain,
the rational analytical, ego

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Once you can shut that down,
you can go higher into the light

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:90%
and pull this stuff back down.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
an aha moment for you

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:84%
when you discovered
that there's some kind

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.077 align:middle line:84%
of musical involvement with
extraterrestrials and artists?

00:20:32.077 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Oh, I was fascinated.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.907 align:middle line:90%
When this Neil Young thing--

00:20:34.907 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:90%
I was just-- I was just floored.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I went, whoa, because it
didn't make any sense.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.725 align:middle line:90%
And it was almost like the hook.

00:20:40.725 --> 00:20:42.975 align:middle line:84%
Like they put you on the
hook, and they pull you down.

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Same as my sighting, I
had no interest in UFOs.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I had done work on
near-death studies.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:90%
I'd done-- I was interested in--

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I had no interest in UFOs.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.795 align:middle line:90%
When I saw the UFO--

00:20:51.795 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha!

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And it's
this thing about--

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's changed your life.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --knowing
and believing.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So people who haven't had
the experience only believe.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I know, once you get into it,
once you have the experience,

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:90%
oh, wow!

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And you know, and it becomes
with absolute certainty,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:90%
and you just move ahead with it.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.444 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, I think
is them moving you,

00:21:09.444 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:84%
almost like the
musicians, they're

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:84%
moving me to move this along,
and it may be something

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:90%
that I agreed to before my--

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I was born to come
in to do this.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So when that moment
happens, it's like, oh,

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it's like, oh, I
remember, I have to do this now.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.022 align:middle line:84%
And you think it's random,
but it's not random.

00:21:25.022 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more you look
at the world, the less random

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:90%
it appears.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People, of
course, have claimed

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.210 align:middle line:84%
that during near-death
experiences,

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:84%
or in special kinds
of dreams, that they

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:90%
hear certain kinds of music.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: It's the same thing.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.203 align:middle line:84%
They're moving into
that higher level.

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:44.880 align:middle line:10%
For example, Eben
Alexander talks

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.875 align:middle line:10%
about his right
near-death experiences.

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.678 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And
here's a neurologist

00:21:48.678 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
from Harvard
University who said,

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
as soon as he had his
experience, the first thing he

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:84%
realized, consciousness
is not in the brain.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And he had this music almost
like this Stuart Sharp

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
with his download of
the "Angeli Symphony,"

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Alexander talks about
being in the muck.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.832 align:middle line:90%
And he hears this music.

00:22:07.832 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And as the music is playing,
he gets pulled out of the muck

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.889 align:middle line:90%
into this heavenly environment.

00:22:11.889 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the music goes away,
and he goes back into the muck.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.042 align:middle line:84%
And he remembers, and he
plays this song in his head.

00:22:17.042 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps lifting
him out of the muck,

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's the same concept.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
It's moving out of this
darkness into the light.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:84%
He tried to recreate the
music, same as Stuart Sharp,

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think
Alexander was ever

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:90%
able to create it, but a lot--

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.862 align:middle line:84%
I do a whole chapter in
the book, "Tuned In,"

00:22:30.862 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:84%
I do a whole chapter on
near-death experiences,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
people who picked up music
during near-death experiences.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.078 align:middle line:84%
And that is, I believe,
because they're--

00:22:37.078 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:84%
they're out of that
darkness, and they're there

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:84%
in these higher levels
where there's more light

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:90%
where you can pick up stuff.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:90%
They get it.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.606 align:middle line:84%
Their near-death
experiences over.

00:22:44.606 --> 00:22:46.860 align:middle line:84%
They go back into the
darkness, and they remember it,

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:90%
almost like a dream.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you
get a dream, you've

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:50.931 align:middle line:90%
been in that environment.

00:22:50.931 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:90%
You're in that higher realm.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
When you go down, you have
to immediately write it down,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.150 align:middle line:90%
or it will disappear.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why do
shamans and other people

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.130 align:middle line:84%
use tones and hums
when they chant?

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.547 align:middle line:84%
What is that trying
to accomplish?

00:23:06.547 --> 00:23:08.171 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I think
it's the same thing.

00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:90%
It's disassociating.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.710 align:middle line:90%
It's getting the person.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.567 align:middle line:84%
It's shutting that person's mind
down, whether it's-- you know,

00:23:13.567 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:84%
it's the same sort
of principle, where

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
they're-- they're
shutting your mind down,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
where you're using one
of these techniques,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
where you sort of go into an
altered state like I did when I

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:90%
had my download experience.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I was watching Colin Andrews
give a lecture on crop circles.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you see he's
one of the best for that.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And I have no
interest in crop circles.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.402 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be in the room.

00:23:30.402 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:90%
So I was sitting there.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching him lecture, and
I didn't want to be there.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.026 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking about
going across the river,

00:23:36.026 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:90%
and I was zoning out.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.782 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't paying
attention, and boom,

00:23:38.782 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:84%
it just came like that
with absolute certainty.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
It was just all this
stuff came into my head.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:43.366 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:23:43.366 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability to dissociate,
to get into that environment,

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
pick up the material,
and bring it back down.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.454 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Elvis
claim that he saw a UFO?

00:23:52.454 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Elvis claimed--
there was a story about Elvis--

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:84%
about the blue light
above his house?

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.536 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: When
he was born, there

00:23:58.536 --> 00:24:01.420 align:middle line:84%
was a story told about the
blue light and his fascination

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:90%
with blue.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But he had this sighting
with his father,

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and he had a sighting
with his hairdresser.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So he had a number of these
sightings that were described.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
He was mentioned in
Michael Luckman's book.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's rattle off
some names of musicians who've

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:84%
been affected by
what you believe

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to be UFO contacts or just
UFO sightings in general.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
So there was Elvis, Neil Young.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Who else is out there?

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.659 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well,
you-- you've got

00:24:28.659 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:84%
John Lennon, who is probably
the biggest one that we know of.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.908 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
mentioned John Lennon.

00:24:32.908 --> 00:24:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN LENNON: Here,
up there, I saw a UFO,

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:10%
and it went down the
river, turned right

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:10%
at the United Nations, turned
left, and then down the river.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't a helicopter,
and it wasn't a balloon,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:10%
and it was so near.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:10%
>> REPORTER: And you looked
what sort of-- round, white,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:48.670 align:middle line:10%
luminescent?

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.811 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN LENNON: Just like--

00:24:49.811 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:10%
>> REPORTER: And silent?

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:51.726 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN LENNON: Silent.

00:24:51.726 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:10%
And it looked dark like
black or gray in the middle

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:10%
and had white lights.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.260 align:middle line:10%
It just looked like
light bulbs, you know?

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:10%
Just going off, on,
off, on, off, on,

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.760 align:middle line:10%
blink, blink, blink, blink
round the bottom, and on top

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:10%
was a red light.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:10%
If you see a little note on
"Walls and Bridges," it says,

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:10%
I saw a UFO.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.144 align:middle line:10%
And I was just finished
doing "Walls and Bridges."

00:25:10.144 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:10%
I'd mastered it or done
the last tape of it,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.392 align:middle line:10%
and I was really just
relaxed and really good.

00:25:15.392 --> 00:25:17.325 align:middle line:10%
And it was summer
in New York, and I

00:25:17.325 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:10%
had the window open, and lo
and behold, there this thing

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.180 align:middle line:10%
just hovering sort
of 100 yards away.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.845 align:middle line:10%
But I saw it so close it
wasn't in the sky or nothing,

00:25:26.845 --> 00:25:27.645 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:25:27.645 --> 00:25:29.976 align:middle line:10%
And it was like I could
have hit it with a brick

00:25:29.976 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:10%
if I'd thrown a stone at it.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.738 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't see the color
because it was dusk.

00:25:33.738 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:10%
It was a good,
clear summer night,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.320 align:middle line:10%
you know, the sky
was very clear.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:10%
And around the
bottom of it was just

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:10%
ordinary-looking electric
light bulbs blinking off and on

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.619 align:middle line:10%
alternatively like on a
billboard or something.

00:25:46.619 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:10%
And on the top of
it was a red light.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:10%
And the thing I noticed was
that there was no noise,

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:10%
and I could hear that freeway
down below all the cars going.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:10%
So I realized, oh,
it's not a helicopter.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:10%
Then it must be a balloon.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:10%
But it was so close
to the rooftop,

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:10%
it couldn't be a balloon.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:10%
So all the rationale
things I went to,

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:10%
it's not a helicopter
or a balloon.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:10%
It's not a balloon.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.410 align:middle line:10%
It's too close to the roof,
and it's maneuvering too well

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:10%
to be a balloon.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.830 align:middle line:10%
So I just watched
it, and it was there

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:10%
for about 5 or 10 minutes.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:10%
It went off down the East
River, and there it was.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.660 align:middle line:10%
And that's all I've
got to say about it.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: More than 40 years
ago, Grant, that happened.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I've got
an interesting story

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:90%
to add to that.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah?

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And I
mentioned this thing

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:90%
about why they're doing it.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.460 align:middle line:10%
For example, you take
a look-- he's talked

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.757 align:middle line:10%
about the white light bulbs.

00:26:28.757 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So I always say when I talk
with John Lennon's sighting,

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:84%
why do they have white light
bulbs on the flying saucer?

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they need that to
fly through interstellar space?

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a message.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
They just want you to see
the flashing light bulbs.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
you to see it.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: But he had
another experience,

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and May Pang talks about this
because May Pang was with him

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:84%
when he had the
sighting there, and she

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
Oz effect, which

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.730 align:middle line:84%
experiencers who are very,
very close will talk about.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Time and space seemed
to change, where your--

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.660 align:middle line:84%
everything seems to--
it's just you and UFO.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And she said she
was looking out--

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.199 align:middle line:84%
and she-- there was
a balcony below them.

00:26:59.199 --> 00:27:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I couldn't figure
out why they didn't come out.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:84%
We were yelling and
screaming, and she's trying

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:90%
to photograph this thing.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:84%
She took a bunch of photographs,
which didn't come out.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.764 align:middle line:84%
And those people didn't
come up, and then she said,

00:27:08.764 --> 00:27:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I looked out, and all the
apartments were vacant.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was gone.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And then this voice
came in her head said,

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:84%
oh, they've all gone
to the Hamptons.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:16.840 align:middle line:90%
So we actually asked her.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We said, doesn't that sound
kind of strange everybody

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.050 align:middle line:84%
in New York went
to the Hamptons?

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was that OZ effect.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
story told by Uri Geller.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.372 align:middle line:84%
Uri Geller tells a
story which indicates

00:27:25.372 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that John Lennon may have--
have been an experiencer.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He saw a UFO.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Geller did.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, OK.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He told me that.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: He had the experience
when he was three years

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:90%
old whatever in the desert.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, which he claims--

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:34.195 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: So he has this
UFO connection as well.

00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --it gave
him these powers.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: But he tells a
story of John taking him

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to a restaurant
in New York City.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And John said--
told him the story.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm there one
night, and it's almost

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:90%
classic abduction thing.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:90%
He said I'm lying there.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.282 align:middle line:84%
He said, and suddenly, I woke
up, and he looked, and he said,

00:27:50.282 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
it looked like there was
a fire in the hallway.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
There was-- there was
light coming in from under

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.820 align:middle line:84%
the doorway, coming
through the keyhole, and--

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and Yoko Ono was
there like a stone,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:90%
and you'll hear people describe.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.940 align:middle line:84%
They can't wake
up their partner,

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.004 align:middle line:84%
and he said, and I went to the
door and opened up the door,

00:28:07.004 --> 00:28:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and there was these bug
people standing there.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.628 align:middle line:84%
And this is Uri Geller
telling this story

00:28:10.628 --> 00:28:11.670 align:middle line:90%
that John had told him.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.420 align:middle line:84%
There was these bug
people standing there.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to go after them,
and they just sort of forced me

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:17.807 align:middle line:90%
back by will.

00:28:17.807 --> 00:28:18.640 align:middle line:90%
They forced me back.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.098 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
next thing I knew,

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I was lying on the bed on top
of the covers, and I woke up,

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.705 align:middle line:84%
and Yoko woke up,
and he had-- they

00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
had left him a small like
an egg-type bronze object.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And so John said
to Uri, he said,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:84%
this may be my ticket
to another planet,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:84%
but I don't want
anything to do with it.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.970 align:middle line:90%
You can keep it.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:40.145 align:middle line:84%
And Uri still has this thing,
and I talked to him about it.

00:28:40.145 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've
never had it analyzed

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:42.520 align:middle line:90%
because I'm always afraid--

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, he should.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: -- it might have
turned out to have been from

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Taiwan.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So Uri Geller says he
keeps this egg object

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.800 align:middle line:90%
that John Lennon gave him.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.510 align:middle line:84%
It's own his possession
at all times.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm sure the
elements of whatever make up

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.740 align:middle line:84%
this little thing
that they left behind

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:84%
is the same throughout
the Universe.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think they're going
to discover an element that's

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.729 align:middle line:90%
so unknown or unusual.

00:29:05.729 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, they're--
I've looked at the implant--

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.910 align:middle line:84%
the implants and the
all the metal material.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
two pieces of metal

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that have been recovered
that look the same.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Hal Puthoff's lab offered
to do the analysis

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.194 align:middle line:90%
on Uri Geller's piece.

00:29:20.194 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But can they
identify these pieces in labs?

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well,
they can identify,

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:84%
like, we can-- we kind of
now with our technology,

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.360 align:middle line:84%
we can identify all these like
UFOs that are flying along,

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.450 align:middle line:90%
and they shoot out some metal.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: They sort of
pretend like they're crashing,

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:30.220 align:middle line:90%
and everybody is watching.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll say it's
nickel or iron, or something

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.500 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.125 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, and now we know
from Jacques Vallee's research

00:29:35.125 --> 00:29:37.357 align:middle line:84%
that some of these have
very bizarre isotopes.

00:29:37.357 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that I've noticed
is that none of the two pieces

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:90%
are the same.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And it may be again the
same messaging thing.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.882 align:middle line:84%
It's like a grade six
project an Alpha Centauri.

00:29:44.882 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And they say, OK, we're
going to drop something

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.299 align:middle line:84%
to raise consciousness, and
we're going to drop some metal.

00:29:49.299 --> 00:29:51.465 align:middle line:84%
And, OK, you kids figure
out what we're going to do.

00:29:51.465 --> 00:29:52.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's get one with--

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:90%
rare isotopes.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's mess around
with the isotopes.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'll send a UFO down, there
and it'll shoot this metal,

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and they'll pick it up
because none of the pieces

00:29:59.200 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:90%
are the same.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.620 align:middle line:84%
They're almost always
pieces are different.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.890 align:middle line:84%
You assume if it's from
UFOs, all the pieces

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:04.690 align:middle line:90%
would be the same.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's piles
of these pieces,

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and I've never seen two
pieces that are the same.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have the bands
ever been abducted en masse?

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.389 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: We have
three stories of bands

00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:14.388 align:middle line:90%
that have been abducted.

00:30:14.388 --> 00:30:16.780 align:middle line:84%
One is a Scottish group that
I haven't tracked down yet.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:90%
One was the Moody Blues.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:18.980 align:middle line:90%
The Moody Blues--

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Moody Blues?

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:20.660 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:90%
What was that--

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.593 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: That
story, they're coming,

00:30:22.593 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:84%
1967, coming from
Manchester into London.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the middle of the morning,
and Pinder is looking out

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.287 align:middle line:90%
the back window of the car.

00:30:30.287 --> 00:30:31.120 align:middle line:90%
He sees this object.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:90%
He's watching.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.114 align:middle line:90%
It just looks like a red light.

00:30:33.114 --> 00:30:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Then he tells these guys, we
should stop and look at this.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.196 align:middle line:84%
They stop on the
motorway, and the thing

00:30:37.196 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:84%
is over on the other
side of the motorway.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, maybe
it's a tower or whatever.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they realized,
no, it's not a tower.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.753 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing they
knew, they were in London,

00:30:44.753 --> 00:30:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and they were three hours late.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And so one of them
actually drew the being

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:90%
that-- that was on the craft.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And
Pinder actually said

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.010 align:middle line:84%
there are lyrics in our songs
that come from elsewhere.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So they were abducted, and we
have a band in Canada that they

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:58.810 align:middle line:90%
haven't--

00:30:58.810 --> 00:30:59.950 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed them.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.020 align:middle line:84%
But their story is going
to come into a book,

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and the entire band
was abducted in 1972.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:90%
He remembers it very clearly.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And then this guy
tells the story

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
of the entire audience being
abducted later on at Brock

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.450 align:middle line:84%
University in Canada, while
they were playing there,

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:90%
where they go into the--

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:90%
they're playing in a bar.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are starting
the first set,

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.050 align:middle line:90%
and there's only one person.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:90%
It's Friday night.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.760 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be jammed,
and they're wondering, like,

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.600 align:middle line:90%
where's the people?

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are they, right.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And so after the
middle of the second set,

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.120 align:middle line:84%
the bartender says, you
might as well go home,

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.995 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't look like
anybody's going to come.

00:31:32.995 --> 00:31:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And the guy is Steve
Boucher, who tells the story.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.630 align:middle line:84%
He says, I walk out to
the front, out the door,

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.720 align:middle line:84%
to go get the cart to
get our musical stuff,

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and all these people are
standing in the hall,

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and he goes, what are you doing?

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.316 align:middle line:84%
What you standing
in the hall for?

00:31:45.316 --> 00:31:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And the guy says, we're
told to stand here.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you don't
have to stand here.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By who?

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Why are you
standing in the hall?

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.913 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, they
told us, and then he

00:31:51.913 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:90%
looked over, and this--

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.180 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing
is, it's a being.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.020 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what are you doing?

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Get back in line.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.620 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm not--

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.490 align:middle line:90%
I got to go get my insurance.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:00.760 align:middle line:90%
I got to go get the cart.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.468 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
well, get back in line.

00:32:02.468 --> 00:32:03.415 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, I'm busy.

00:32:03.415 --> 00:32:04.540 align:middle line:90%
I've got to go get my cart.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So the beam takes him out, and
there's a flying saucer there.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this
guy can't stay.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:90%
He can't stay.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:90%
He's got to go.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:12.500 align:middle line:90%
And the-- they--

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa!

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: They say, oh, we
haven't got time for this guy.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Take him back.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So they take him
back to the truck,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and they said, stay
around for my buddies

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.507 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to be
angry because I'm late now.

00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:90%
I want you to stay around.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, we can't.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:90%
We can't.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
well, just stay there,

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:90%
and I'll just point to you.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:27.705 align:middle line:90%
And then he told his--

00:32:27.705 --> 00:32:29.039 align:middle line:90%
his band members are very upset.

00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:29.838 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:32:29.838 --> 00:32:30.850 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, they,
and we looked over,

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.421 align:middle line:90%
and these guys were gone.

00:32:33.421 --> 00:32:34.510 align:middle line:90%
So he tells this story.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.820 align:middle line:84%
The entire band and some
of them were regressed.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fascinating
story of entire bands

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:90%
that were abducted.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some musicians have
been known to use drugs, right?

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:47.080 align:middle line:90%
And heavy drugs.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Mhm.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know
some of these stories

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.540 align:middle line:84%
aren't the byproduct
of the drug usage?

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, it's clear
that drugs help you dissociate.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:84%
We use this with psilocybin,
with high-dose LSD.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.780 align:middle line:84%
In the 1950s, Hewlett-Packard
was using LSD with

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:05.715 align:middle line:90%
their engineers to--

00:33:05.715 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Make them
more creative.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: To make
them more creative.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.813 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
this kind of thing

00:33:09.813 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:84%
because it sort of
causes you to dissociate.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And so when I looked at
that, people would say,

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.970 align:middle line:90%
oh, they're satanic.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.767 align:middle line:90%
They're-- they're bad guys.

00:33:18.767 --> 00:33:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They're, you know,
this kind of stuff.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:21.683 align:middle line:90%
They're doing drugs or whatever.

00:33:21.683 --> 00:33:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So what I did, and
tuned in, my mother

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:84%
was a church organist
for 40 years.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, I'll just
look at the music of Bach,

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and Beethoven, and all
this kind of stuff,

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:33.394 align:middle line:84%
same story, identical
story, except that

00:33:33.394 --> 00:33:35.560 align:middle line:84%
instead of saying aliens,
then they were saying God.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's a famous story
that was told about Beethoven.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Beethoven had created
this symphony,

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and the conductor said,
you know this left--

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:48.250 align:middle line:84%
left-handed violin piece that
you played in this composition?

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely unplayable.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And Beethoven said
to him, I'll have

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:84%
you know that when I
composed that symphony,

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.541 align:middle line:90%
I was communing with God.

00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And do you think I
had time to worry

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.012 align:middle line:84%
about your little,
puny violin piece?

00:33:59.012 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same thing.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:00.920 align:middle line:90%
It's disassociating.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is,
in the old days

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.760 align:middle line:84%
they talked about talking to
God, or talking to dead people,

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.560 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.435 align:middle line:84%
And now we've sort of
moved it, and now we're

00:34:08.435 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:90%
talking about aliens.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.833 align:middle line:90%
I think it's all the same thing.

00:34:10.833 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
It's this disassociating, moving
into a lighter realm where

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.389 align:middle line:84%
you're able to see more
and getting the material,

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:90%
like dream songs.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I've got 150 dream songs,
famous songs, like "Yesterday,"

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:84%
"Let It Be," songs like
this that came in dreams.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And the magicians will
all say the same thing.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not like an ordinary dream.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They-- they composed
it in the dream, right?

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: It comes
automatically.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.520 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's-- there's no symbols.

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:35.770 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.531 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly as the
piece is played.

00:34:37.531 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So they just have to go back
and quickly compose this.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Write it down
before they forget.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, like
this Alma Deutscher,

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.894 align:middle line:90%
this six-year-old girl.

00:34:44.894 --> 00:34:46.060 align:middle line:90%
That's what she talks about.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's a genius.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.489 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: She talks about
this that it's there.

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's all there, and they
know how to compose it.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a couple of these
young kids, where they they're

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:53.739 align:middle line:90%
writing more.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Or there's a woman
in Great Britain, who

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:02.590 align:middle line:84%
was talking to ancient like
Bach, Beethoven, Liszt,

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.580 align:middle line:90%
all this kind of stuff.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
She actually does a
thing for BBC on camera,

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.584 align:middle line:84%
where Beethoven is
dictating music to her,

00:35:08.584 --> 00:35:10.375 align:middle line:84%
and she's sitting there,
and she's writing.

00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's perfect music.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And then
she can't even play it.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the BBC plays
what she actually--

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and once she's
composed, she says,

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.048 align:middle line:84%
Beethoven's telling
me to hurry up.

00:35:19.048 --> 00:35:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And she's writing this stuff,
and so it's the same thing.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:22.924 align:middle line:90%
It's disassociation.

00:35:22.924 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:90%
And this woman was a medium.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:25.298 align:middle line:90%
She was actually getting art.

00:35:25.298 --> 00:35:27.570 align:middle line:84%
She could draw, paint
like famous painters,

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and she was talking to about
20 different musicians,

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.390 align:middle line:84%
ancient musicians
with compositions,

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and she really
couldn't play music.

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.630 align:middle line:90%
But she was getting this music.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same sort of thing
where we're being helped.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We're able to go up into the
field, and we're just get--

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.450 align:middle line:84%
able to get out of this
sort of materialistic dance

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.664 align:middle line:84%
world go up there because the
closer you get to the light,

00:35:48.664 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:84%
the more light there is,
the more information.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But the light has
all the information.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:84%
The closer you get to
the light, the more

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.590 align:middle line:84%
you can see, and the
more information you get.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rock star
Sammy Hagar talked

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:90%
about his UFO experience.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SAMMY HAGAR: I'm dreaming.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:10%
I see these guys in my head.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:04.980 align:middle line:10%
I see these--

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:10%
>> DREW PINSKY: What
did they look like?

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.474 align:middle line:10%
>> HAGAR: They were
just kind of this--

00:36:07.474 --> 00:36:09.720 align:middle line:10%
like beams of light, you know?

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.497 align:middle line:84%
And they were kind of blue,
OK, and with no features

00:36:13.497 --> 00:36:14.580 align:middle line:90%
because it was a close up.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.329 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- you know,
it was just kind of--

00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and-- and I'm dreaming,
and they're going,

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.120 align:middle line:90%
oh, he's waking up.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.380 align:middle line:10%
We got to end this, right?

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:10%
But it wasn't language spoken.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.590 align:middle line:10%
It was just, you know,
a telepathic thing.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And then they hollered out this
weird, digital, numerical code

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:10%
of our numerical system.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like 9, 11, 12,
13, 14, and it went whoop,

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:90%
and it ended.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.309 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like there was a
cord plugged into my head.

00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:41.100 align:middle line:84%
But of course, what
they were 13 miles away

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.540 align:middle line:90%
where I knew where they were.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I knew the area I was in.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.540 align:middle line:90%
It was in my home.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.081 align:middle line:10%
It was like one of those dreams
when everything was the same.

00:36:47.081 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up, and I
went-- it put me on a quest

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.110 align:middle line:90%
to say, what was that?

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.370 align:middle line:90%
That was so real.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.057 align:middle line:84%
So I think it was a
download and upload

00:36:55.057 --> 00:36:56.640 align:middle line:84%
situation, like an
experimental thing,

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.795 align:middle line:90%
like I was some guinea pig.

00:36:57.795 --> 00:36:58.920 align:middle line:10%
They would just plug it in.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>> PINSKY: Did you ever
see the move "Contact"?

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HAGAR: What's that?

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> PINSKY: The movie
"Contact" with Foster.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> HAGAR: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PINSKY: It was that
kind of an experience?

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.420 align:middle line:10%
>> HAGAR: Yeah, yeah, and
you know, I'm a big believer.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.510 align:middle line:84%
First of all, doctor,
anyone that-- you know,

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.010 align:middle line:84%
you can call me
crazy all you want.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But everyone says there's no
one in this whole Universe,

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:16.530 align:middle line:84%
we're the only life in this
whole, big, giant, vast

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:17.776 align:middle line:90%
Universe, they're crazy.

00:37:17.776 --> 00:37:18.775 align:middle line:90%
>> PINSKY: That's Right.

00:37:18.775 --> 00:37:19.350 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely agree with you.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> HAGAR: That's scary.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>> PINSKY: I agree.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.620 align:middle line:10%
I think, actually, life
gets catapulted forward

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.885 align:middle line:10%
by sort of catastrophic
events from the Universe.

00:37:24.885 --> 00:37:26.010 align:middle line:10%
I have no doubt about that.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.520 align:middle line:84%
But-- but I'll remain
skeptical about the guys

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.640 align:middle line:90%
with the white light.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.681 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, they're
everywhere, aren't they?

00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, another big
one was Ace Frehley from Kiss.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:34.760 align:middle line:90%
One of the biggest--

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah, huge.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --biggest
money bands of all times.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And he tells the story.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.086 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them musicians,
like the rock guys,

00:37:40.086 --> 00:37:41.460 align:middle line:84%
they're, like,
they didn't really

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.750 align:middle line:90%
care what people say about them.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.890 align:middle line:90%
So Ace Frehley told the story.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.431 align:middle line:84%
He said, I woke up
in a doorway, half

00:37:45.431 --> 00:37:46.860 align:middle line:84%
in the doorway,
half in the house.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.276 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'd woken up in a lot
of weird places in my life,

00:37:49.276 --> 00:37:51.025 align:middle line:84%
but this was the
weirdest place of all.

00:37:51.025 --> 00:37:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
these recollections

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.240 align:middle line:84%
of being on the ship
and this sort of stuff.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.364 align:middle line:84%
And he goes into the shower,
and he checks his body

00:37:56.364 --> 00:37:57.460 align:middle line:90%
for different type--

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.370 align:middle line:84%
with his scoop marks
or stuff like that.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.495 align:middle line:84%
And he goes into the
backyard, and there's a circle

00:38:01.495 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:90%
burnt into his backyard.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's 27 feet across.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's my lucky number.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's these very
major musicians who

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:90%
are very open about the fact--

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.830 align:middle line:90%
or Cat Stevens.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Very famous story, Cat Stevens,
before he became Muslim,

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.900 align:middle line:84%
told this story in
the early 1970s.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
He tells the story,
I was on top of a--

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:84%
a roof in London, and he
said, this UFO came over,

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and it sucked me up into
the UFO and dropped me.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't a dream.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:90%
I know this was for real.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:90%
He wrote two songs.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.120 align:middle line:84%
One was called "Longer Boats"
about his UFO experience.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And the second was
called "Freezing Steel."

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.800 align:middle line:84%
He said I was on
the ship, the ship

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.732 align:middle line:84%
of freezing steel, the ship
without the guiding wheel.

00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And because I do the
consciousness thing,

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.210 align:middle line:90%
I deal with--

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:42.476 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --I've 50 people
who have flown the ship,

00:38:42.476 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:90%
and they all say the same thing.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.540 align:middle line:90%
You fly the ship with your mind.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.760 align:middle line:90%
There is no guiding wheel.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So Sammy Hagar, or Cat
Stevens, has this in his lyrics

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:56.010 align:middle line:84%
about this fact that there's
no guiding wheel on the ship.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why were so
many musicians abducted?

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.509 align:middle line:90%
Why-- why are they taken?

00:39:00.509 --> 00:39:01.925 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well,
that's a-- that's

00:39:01.925 --> 00:39:04.670 align:middle line:84%
a question I really can't really
say except that a lot of them

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:05.470 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.377 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
higher-level experience,

00:39:07.377 --> 00:39:09.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's all messaging
to me, whether you're

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.430 align:middle line:84%
taken aboard the ship or like
John Lennon with the lights

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.700 align:middle line:90%
are on it.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Why do UFOs have lights on them?

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.500 align:middle line:90%
So you can see them.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.650 align:middle line:84%
If you see a UFO,
you're part of the game.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:84%
If they want to
cloak themselves,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.520 align:middle line:84%
they-- they can just make
themselves disappear.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:84%
When you see a UFO, they
want you to see the UFO.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.950 align:middle line:90%
So you're part of it.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it's this-- it's
this messaging thing that they

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.860 align:middle line:84%
want these-- these sort
of famous musicians

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:84%
to come forward because
they're lifting consciousness.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.440 align:middle line:90%
People-- you have--

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.640 align:middle line:90%
almost like Tom DeLonge.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Tom DeLonge appeals
to this very young age

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.200 align:middle line:90%
group, the same with musicians.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you're between
0 and 10 years old,

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.430 align:middle line:90%
your parents are your heroes.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you're 10 years old,
you say to your parents,

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.920 align:middle line:90%
get away from me.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Stay away.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And your heroes
become musicians.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So if they want to influence
the generation between say

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:57.016 align:middle line:84%
10 and 25, you're going to put
the messages through musicians

00:39:57.016 --> 00:39:58.890 align:middle line:84%
because that's who the
kids are listening to.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's almost
like a PR campaign.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah,
yeah, that's what I--

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.541 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A brilliant one.

00:40:02.541 --> 00:40:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: That's why I say
in 43 years of UFO experience,

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:84%
the more I see it, the more
I think it's all messaging.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.590 align:middle line:90%
They're here to message stuff.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why they shut down
nuclear missile silos.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:14.250 align:middle line:90%
They're messaging us.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:84%
They're doing this
kind of stuff.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just constant messaging,
trying to raise consciousness

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:20.900 align:middle line:84%
to the fact we're not alone,
and when you get there,

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of
consciousness, that it's not

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.720 align:middle line:90%
the physical world.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not a random, meaningless--
we're not biological robots

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.750 align:middle line:90%
in a meaningless universe.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It's much more
complex than that.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
messages that I think

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.138 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to put across.

00:40:34.138 --> 00:40:36.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do UFOS visit concerts?

00:40:36.095 --> 00:40:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yes, Bono
had one over his concert

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.350 align:middle line:90%
that he had in Salt Lake City.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And people
could see this?

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah,
people could see it.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:43.970 align:middle line:90%
It was filmed.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:44.844 align:middle line:90%
It's on the internet.

00:40:44.844 --> 00:40:45.980 align:middle line:90%
You can see this.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Jimi Hendrix had one in--

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.780 align:middle line:90%
playing in Hawaii.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Springsteen had one over a
concert, a fundraising concert,

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.470 align:middle line:84%
for Obama in Philadelphia
that was filmed.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.900 align:middle line:90%
It was during the day.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:90%
It happens pretty often.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Ozzy Osbourne had
won over his concert.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's these bizarre
sort of connections to UFOs.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the music from
the UFOs influence the musician?

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Or is it the other way
around, because who

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.450 align:middle line:90%
comes up with the lyrics?

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Who comes up with the tone of
the music, the composition?

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Or is that given to the
musician by the ETs?

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Well, it's both.

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- it's like
you and I are talking.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So where did the words
come from when we talk?

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.870 align:middle line:90%
People think it's in your head.

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I could say,
I ask you a question,

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.883 align:middle line:84%
which creates your words
because you answer me--

00:41:39.883 --> 00:41:40.683 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:41:40.683 --> 00:41:41.056 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:41.056 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --based
on how I led you.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: You don't have
to think about the words.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:42.560 align:middle line:90%
You just talk.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And the words go, and it's
like-- and I say to people,

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:84%
do you really think
there's neurons

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.750 align:middle line:84%
running around putting words
in the sentence as you talk?

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.083 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from somewhere else.

00:41:49.083 --> 00:41:50.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what Eben Alexander said.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.860 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing
he realized after

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.526 align:middle line:84%
his near-death
experience, consciousness

00:41:53.526 --> 00:41:54.810 align:middle line:90%
is not in the brain.

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And so it's this idea
where you disassociate.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You get the material, and
you-- you bring it back down.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Psychedelica," sounded
healing of sonic psychedelics

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.759 align:middle line:90%
from our show.

00:42:06.759 --> 00:42:08.550 align:middle line:10%
>> NARRATOR: Vibration
plays a role in many

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.190 align:middle line:10%
of the world's religions,
especially in their stories

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.740 align:middle line:10%
of how the world began.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.800 align:middle line:84%
In Genesis 1, verse
2, God's spirit

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.830 align:middle line:84%
moved across the
face of the waters.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:22.770 align:middle line:10%
The Cherokee wisdom
keeper, Dhyani Ywahoo,

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:25.020 align:middle line:10%
states that in
their creation myth

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.200 align:middle line:10%
from the mysterious
creator came forth

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.980 align:middle line:10%
a sound, the fundamental tone
of the universal song underlying

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.510 align:middle line:10%
all manifestation.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:10%
Native American peyote Church
Road man, Kuauhtli Vasquez,

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.010 align:middle line:10%
recounts the creation
myth of his ancestry

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.830 align:middle line:10%
and how sound or vibration
played a vital role.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:49.250 align:middle line:10%
>>KUAUHTLI VASQUEZ: They say
that, in our culture, the--

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:53.630 align:middle line:10%
the Creator Spirit wanted
the world to begin in motion.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So he told the old
coyote to go to the ocean

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and take one of
those conch shells

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.530 align:middle line:84%
out and make a
trumpet out of it.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And when he blew it,
it started creating

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.500 align:middle line:84%
this spiral wave of
sound, which sounds

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.740 align:middle line:90%
kind of like, om, you know?

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So the old coyote
blew it, and this

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.157 align:middle line:90%
started everything vibrating.

00:43:15.157 --> 00:43:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it has an
effect on consciousness too,

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.479 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it, sound and music?

00:43:18.479 --> 00:43:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, it's one of
the expressions they have,

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:22.340 align:middle line:90%
it's all vibration.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Vibration is part of how
the Universe is established.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you pick up the vibration,
that-- that's the way it goes.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.310 align:middle line:90%
It's basically all vibration.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It's all tone, and it's
part of how it works.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We were just talking
about dreams and the songs that

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.040 align:middle line:90%
are created in the dream state.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:40.840 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.381 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well,
it's the same thing.

00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:43.520 align:middle line:90%
It's be able to dissociate.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:90%
So let me give you an example.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.190 align:middle line:84%
"Yesterday," one was
famous songs of all times,

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Paul McCartney wakes
up in the middle night,

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:53.690 align:middle line:90%
and the song is in his head.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
piano in the room--

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he can't
get it out of his head.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And he quickly
goes to the piano,

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and he gets the chords,
and he gets it all down.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And then for a long time
after, he goes to people,

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.063 align:middle line:84%
and he said, have you ever
heard this song before?

00:44:03.063 --> 00:44:06.350 align:middle line:84%
He was absolutely certain that
somebody else composed it.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:09.110 align:middle line:84%
He had a second dream that he
was playing with the Rolling

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Stones, and it was
called "No Regrets,"

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and he-- and he woke
up and he thought,

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that was a fantastic-- he
was playing with the Rolling

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Stones.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.842 align:middle line:84%
He said, that was a
fantastic song they played.

00:44:17.842 --> 00:44:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And he went, they
never played that song.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote it down,
and he said he never

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:21.560 align:middle line:90%
told the Rolling Stones.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he--

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Because they
would want royalties.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.217 align:middle line:84%
And then he had the one, "Let It
Be," which is the famous song.

00:44:26.217 --> 00:44:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great song.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And
people don't realize

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:90%
where these songs come from.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.575 align:middle line:84%
So everybody thinks it's
got to do with Mother Mary

00:44:31.575 --> 00:44:32.630 align:middle line:90%
In the Bible.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And then he tells the actual
story of what happened.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.626 align:middle line:90%
It's the end of the Beatles.

00:44:35.626 --> 00:44:37.160 align:middle line:90%
The Beatles are breaking up.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Yoko Ono was coming in.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:39.608 align:middle line:84%
They don't like
her being in there.

00:44:39.608 --> 00:44:40.580 align:middle line:90%
There's drug problems.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.150 align:middle line:90%
He's been divorced or whatever.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.370 align:middle line:90%
And he's very troubled.

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:46.790 align:middle line:84%
He goes to sleep, and his
mother, whose name was Mary,

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:50.360 align:middle line:84%
died when he was 13 years
old, comes to him in a dream

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.500 align:middle line:90%
and said, Paul, it's OK.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let it be.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.175 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Let it be.

00:44:54.175 --> 00:44:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he said,
in times of trouble,

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.977 align:middle line:84%
Mother Mary comes to me speaking
words of wisdom, let it be.

00:44:58.977 --> 00:45:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We thought it was
the Virgin Mary in that song.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: That's right.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.163 align:middle line:10%
And he actually tells the story
on tape of how this-- how this

00:45:04.163 --> 00:45:05.480 align:middle line:10%
actually came about.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think ETs will
continue to select musicians

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.360 align:middle line:90%
for messages?

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Absolutely, I think
they're-- they're messaging all

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:13.800 align:middle line:90%
sorts of people.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.360 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm part of the message.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're part
of the message,

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Especially
when you see this thing

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:19.910 align:middle line:84%
with-- with people
who see things,

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and why are they showing
John Lennon light

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.710 align:middle line:90%
bulbs around the thing?

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.860 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's all this messaging
trying to raise consciousness.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your career,
Grant, how would you

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.900 align:middle line:90%
categorize this situation?

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Can we call it a phenomenon,
the music and the ETs?

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
you categorize that?

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.926 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, I would
say it's where it is.

00:45:39.926 --> 00:45:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It's where it's
at because I spent

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:46.340 align:middle line:84%
the great part of my career
from '75 to 2012 thinking

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.650 align:middle line:84%
it was all nuts and bolts,
chasing this whole thing.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.360 align:middle line:84%
When I had the
consciousness thing,

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly realized,
this is the solution

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.497 align:middle line:84%
unless you understand
how consciousness works.

00:45:54.497 --> 00:45:55.996 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think
it's so important

00:45:55.996 --> 00:45:57.230 align:middle line:90%
with the reincarnation thing.

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:01.040 align:middle line:84%
If you establish that
there is this continuity

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.040 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness from
one lifetime to another,

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.110 align:middle line:84%
then you realize this is
how the Universe works,

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
get the principles

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:08.624 align:middle line:84%
because right now,
we're assuming

00:46:08.624 --> 00:46:11.930 align:middle line:84%
it's a physical, random
world, and we don't realize

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.470 align:middle line:90%
consciousness is primary.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Material is second.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:16.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's all consciousness.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.370 align:middle line:90%
And they're using this.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.280 align:middle line:84%
They understand more
about consciousness

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to sort of educate us
to where we're going.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a lot of people
now are moving to this field,

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that what Jacques Vallée said.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd be very surprised
if this turns out

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to be just extraterrestrials
coming to visit the Earth.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.860 align:middle line:90%
And I agree--

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's
much more than that.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --once you
get to the consciousness,

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.510 align:middle line:84%
then I think you can solve this
thing because so much of it

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.120 align:middle line:84%
ties into this consciousness
aspect of how reality actually

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.920 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.929 align:middle line:84%
We're just making
false assumptions

00:46:44.929 --> 00:46:46.220 align:middle line:90%
about how things actually work.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody
else selected this topic

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:50.090 align:middle line:90%
like you have?

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Absolutely,
it surprises me.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've--
I've not heard that.

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Actually,
even the dream songs.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.494 align:middle line:84%
There was there was Michael
Luckman, but he's now died.

00:46:56.494 --> 00:46:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually
doing a second book.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.170 align:middle line:84%
When he heard I was doing
my book, and he had--

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.530 align:middle line:84%
his interest was
UFOs, and musicians,

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:90%
and who was involved.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.151 align:middle line:84%
I was more interested,
because I'd

00:47:07.151 --> 00:47:09.650 align:middle line:84%
had the download experience,
why are they picking musicians?

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:10.691 align:middle line:90%
What's actually going on?

00:47:10.691 --> 00:47:12.260 align:middle line:90%
The consciousness aspect to it.

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:13.920 align:middle line:84%
When he heard I
was doing my book,

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.610 align:middle line:84%
he said, I've got enough
material for a second book.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was just about
finished with the second book,

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and then he had this
stroke and died.

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually
another book out there

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:23.720 align:middle line:90%
on this whole subject.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, I don't
think anybody is doing anything

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:26.210 align:middle line:90%
on music.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was a great guest
for us on "Coast to Coast."

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.698 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: His death,
of course, it's

00:47:30.698 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:84%
sad because we've lost
so many great people who

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:84%
have researched and
did everything else.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, and he was good
friends with like David Bowie.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:90%
He was good friends David Bowie.

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: He was actually
going have a concert.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.740 align:middle line:84%
He was going to
have a UFO Woodstock

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.122 align:middle line:90%
concert At Pepperdine--

00:47:44.122 --> 00:47:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
have been huge.

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And he was
talking about the Stones.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.270 align:middle line:84%
He was talking
about David Bowie.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:53.160 align:middle line:90%
He was talking about Michael--

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what if
a UFO appears there?

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
have been great.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And that would have
been to raise the consciousness

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:57.750 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.083 align:middle line:84%
And then he was working on
the permitting for this thing

00:48:00.083 --> 00:48:03.290 align:middle line:84%
at Pepperdine University,
this big UFO Woodstock,

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and then he had the
stroke and died.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're still trying to revive
that idea of some time having

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:84%
a concert, where a
lot of experiences--

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.090 align:middle line:84%
there's actually
an album came out

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:17.530 align:middle line:84%
in Great Britain with 18
contactees, experiencers,

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:18.490 align:middle line:90%
with music.

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we're trying to
revive this idea now,

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:23.020 align:middle line:84%
this album is just
coming out, where

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.960 align:middle line:84%
we're going to try to get
experiencer people to play

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.660 align:middle line:84%
in a concert to get-- they would
really raise consciousness.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure would.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Where
people would realize,

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.450 align:middle line:84%
like, all these musicians
are into this kind of stuff

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:34.741 align:middle line:84%
because they can get the
message across where sometimes

00:48:34.741 --> 00:48:36.070 align:middle line:90%
you and I can't get it across.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people are
listening to musicians.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.734 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're absolutely
sure this is an ET event?

00:48:40.734 --> 00:48:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, no,
I'm saying, I may--

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.330 align:middle line:84%
it appears to be an ET event,
but as I said, when you go back

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.940 align:middle line:84%
a couple hundred years ago
when there was no ET talk,

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:49.930 align:middle line:90%
it was the same thing.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:52.900 align:middle line:84%
It was these songs coming
in with different messages

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:56.980 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is that I think
that there's this higher level

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.450 align:middle line:84%
where ETs live, where angels
live, where it's higher--

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:01.250 align:middle line:90%
higher--

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a different
plane of existence.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.071 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Higher beings.

00:49:03.071 --> 00:49:04.810 align:middle line:84%
That's where Bashar
said, we come into--

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.800 align:middle line:84%
we come into your dreams
because now you're in our world.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Like, you've moved out.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.080 align:middle line:90%
You're in the dream world.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.732 align:middle line:90%
You're in out of the darkness.

00:49:12.732 --> 00:49:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot
of people say to me,

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.606 align:middle line:90%
oh, I've had UFO experience.

00:49:15.606 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:90%
I've never been abducted.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.042 align:middle line:90%
I just have dreams about them.

00:49:18.042 --> 00:49:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you
think their dreams.

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the same thing.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:21.951 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: It's the same thing.

00:49:21.951 --> 00:49:24.580 align:middle line:84%
They may be moving your astral
body out, or talking to you

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.220 align:middle line:84%
in a dream, and talking
to your higher self

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.830 align:middle line:84%
when you're disassociated,
when your left brain, when

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:31.989 align:middle line:84%
you're sleeping, your
left brain is quieted--

00:49:31.989 --> 00:49:34.030 align:middle line:84%
quiet and down, that's
when they can talk to you.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many
experiencers, I believe,

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.680 align:middle line:84%
say that they get aliens
coming to them in dreams

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and giving them messages
and stuff like that.

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And the same with musicians,
they're getting it

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:46.717 align:middle line:84%
during their dream things,
dream sessions, the songs,

00:49:46.717 --> 00:49:49.300 align:middle line:84%
because they're in that higher
state where there's more light,

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.008 align:middle line:84%
and they can see more
of what's going on.

00:49:51.008 --> 00:49:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are all these
messages and songs

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that are given to the musicians
from the ETs positive,

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.197 align:middle line:84%
or are there some
real dangerous ones?

00:49:58.197 --> 00:49:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I haven't
looked that much.

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I do the one about love is
the number one thing in music.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.400 align:middle line:90%
It's the number one message.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.166 align:middle line:84%
And the oneness thing
does come across a bit.

00:50:09.166 --> 00:50:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's
pretty positive stuff.

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.623 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, it's
pretty positive stuff.

00:50:12.623 --> 00:50:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And you have musicians
who do like garbage songs.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.595 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is,
whatever their song

00:50:18.595 --> 00:50:19.970 align:middle line:84%
is, you got to
realize what level

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that they are when
they cut the songs.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.199 align:middle line:84%
That's why to me
the dream songs are

00:50:23.199 --> 00:50:24.842 align:middle line:84%
so important because
then you know

00:50:24.842 --> 00:50:26.050 align:middle line:90%
they're out of that darkness.

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:30.460 align:middle line:84%
They're not just making it
up or, you know, on the fly.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.840 align:middle line:90%
They're actually pulling it out.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I say, if
we can learn to dissociate,

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:36.160 align:middle line:84%
if we can teach
people how to do this,

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.926 align:middle line:84%
to dissociate, to go into that
field and bring stuff back,

00:50:39.926 --> 00:50:41.050 align:middle line:90%
then you can invent things.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:41.890 align:middle line:90%
You can do music.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:43.870 align:middle line:84%
You can do art because
it's all there.

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:46.270 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the inventions
and all the information

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:47.440 align:middle line:90%
is there.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just the ability to go up
there and bring it back down.

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has any musician
talked about the type of ET

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:57.940 align:middle line:90%
that gave him or her the music?

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Are they Greys, Nordics,
Reptilians, what might they be?

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.640 align:middle line:90%
What kind of race?

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I've
never really heard.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.140 align:middle line:84%
No, no, I've never
heard any musician talk

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.751 align:middle line:84%
about any particular
type of being

00:51:10.751 --> 00:51:13.000 align:middle line:84%
that I can think of, except
for the Moody Blues talk--

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.310 align:middle line:84%
they have a being that looks
sort of like a Grey, one

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:16.110 align:middle line:90%
of the Moody Blues.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm just
wandering if the Greys are

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:19.100 align:middle line:90%
the creative ones.

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:24.644 align:middle line:84%
Well, John Anderson,
who from the band Yes,

00:51:24.644 --> 00:51:26.060 align:middle line:84%
was actually
interviewed one time.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I believe
that all art and music

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:30.932 align:middle line:90%
comes from the Pleiades.

00:51:30.932 --> 00:51:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And the person who
was interviewing

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:34.300 align:middle line:84%
them didn't follow up, like,
where do you get this from?

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.258 align:middle line:90%
Like what's this about?

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So John Anderson sold
50 million albums.

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:37.990 align:middle line:10%
He was not a small guy.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:39.580 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: And he had
some UFO experiences

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.538 align:middle line:10%
that he's told privately
to people, some pretty

00:51:41.538 --> 00:51:42.790 align:middle line:10%
bizarre experiences.

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:47.820 align:middle line:10%
So-- but in terms of the alien,
I'm not really sure what it is.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.110 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a dream
thing where they're--

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.694 align:middle line:90%
they're getting it.

00:51:51.694 --> 00:51:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Grant, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Thanks for having me.

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:55.714 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate your interest.

00:51:55.714 --> 00:52:00.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating research,
music and extraterrestrials.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The next time you
hear a song, just

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.530 align:middle line:90%
wonder where did that come from?

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
