>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.379 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.104 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:20.770 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NARRATOR: And now, the host
of the nationally syndicated

How's everybody?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody, at
one point in their life,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
wants love, wants
a relationship.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Well our special guest
tonight on "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Marla Martenson, author of
"Excuse Me, Your Soul Mate

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
is Waiting," she
is a matchmaker.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's welcome Marla Martenson.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.426 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Marla.

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MARLA MARTENSON: Hi, George.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.266 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good to see you.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Hey, you too.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Have a seat.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.994 align:middle line:90%
So what is a matchmaker?

00:01:10.994 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, boy.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, a matchmaker
is someone who

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
will facilitate
finding your soul mate,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:90%
or a relationship, really.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
It's, I get a lot
of male clients

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.475 align:middle line:84%
who are CEOs of
companies, they're busy,

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:23.717 align:middle line:90%
they're traveling around.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
go on the internet.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.841 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
hang out at a bar.

00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:90%
So they say, Marla, you take it.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what I want, and
you find me a great quality.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And you go searching.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: And I search.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm a-- I'm a real-life cupid.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it easy to
find the right person,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.649 align:middle line:90%
to match up the right people?

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: You know,
I get people emailing me,

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
sometimes women who say, oh,
I'd love to be a matchmaker.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Can I work with you?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Or can you be my mentor?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It looks so easy,
and so much fun.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, it is fun.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not always easy, because
people have their lists,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, of what they
want in a perfect person.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And when they're paying for
someone to find it for them,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
they really expect you
to deliver, you know?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So if somebody comes
to you as a client and says,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to find the
ideal mate for me,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.096 align:middle line:84%
how many people do they normally
go through before they find

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.016 align:middle line:90%
that person.

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:13.182 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: You know,
well, something's very cute.

00:02:13.182 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I have a new client
now, he's 73.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:90%
He is absolutely adorable.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And I matched him on his
first match, the other day,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:90%
and they went out to dinner.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
He sent her flowers
on Valentine's Day.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And he calls me up, he
goes, you're a genius.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I love
starting my day like that.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So that was nice to hear,
and he was really happy.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Some people are extremely
picky and, George,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.969 align:middle line:90%
they might go through 25--

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No?

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: 30 people.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:84%
They might keep-- I have a guy
who's been with me 10 years.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.999 align:middle line:84%
And he wants something
really specific.

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think he's
probably going to find it.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 10 years?

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.948 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, you know.

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And he
pays his fee, right?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: He does.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.779 align:middle line:90%
He does.

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:90%
And he's a great guy.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.678 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Maybe he doesn't
want a relationship.

00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he's just having fun.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.684 align:middle line:84%
People, psychologists
and things,

00:02:53.684 --> 00:02:55.482 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a psychologist
or a psychiatrist.

00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a cupid.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.937 align:middle line:84%
But people that I
talk to say, people

00:02:57.937 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
like that, they have
blocks, and they really

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
don't want to find
a relationship

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:90%
and they say they do.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what percent of
the people that you match up

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.955 align:middle line:90%
end up getting married?

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:09.663 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: I always
get this question.

00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:90%
What's your success rate?

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.399 align:middle line:84%
In the 10 years I've
been doing this,

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many
marriages, I've gone

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to a couple really great
weddings, babies being born.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have a number,
because sometimes people

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.314 align:middle line:84%
will go off into
the sunset dating,

00:03:20.314 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and then they get married
and I never know about it.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But it does happen.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Oh,
sure it happens.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And they're happy.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And off they go.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: I have had a
couple people who've gotten

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.640 align:middle line:84%
divorced and came back
for another round.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Really?

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: I mean this is--

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: With
different people, right?

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: With different
people, because we do have,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
A 50% divorce rate
in this country.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.127 align:middle line:84%
So of course it's
going to happen.

00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you know, I wanted
to ask you about that, Marla.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:84%
What is nowadays, with the
pressures of everything,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:84%
family, the economy,
everything, what's

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.402 align:middle line:84%
it like to try to develop
a relationship today?

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, I'm
thinking of my kids

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:90%
and my grandchildren.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.735 align:middle line:84%
What's it going to
be like for them?

00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, now it's
really changed from when I--

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, when you
and I were growing up.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
We had our mothers stayed
home, at least mine did.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Most mothers did.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was cookies in
the cookie jar, dinner at 6:00.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was really a great
thing to have your mom at home.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And kind of the
"Leave it To Beaver"

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:90%
family and neighborhood.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But now, most
women have to work.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:90%
We're a partnership.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:84%
So I always say, my husband
and I, we're a team.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And we always say, you know, we
squabble or anything, we say,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
remember we're a team, and
we're doing this together.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's what couples
really have to do,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:90%
nowadays, most couples.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What about disasters?

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
We see things,
and I want to talk

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to a lot about the
internet, Marla.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But we have a case
going where, I think,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:84%
a woman met somebody
on a dating service

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and she got stabbed
by the individual.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.376 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, that
was-- she's suing Match.com

00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:90%
because she had dated a man.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
I think they only
went out a few times.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Known him maybe
eight days or so.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
She broke it off because
she felt something was off.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, I believe, this
is just what I'm remembering

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
from what I've seen
on TV and the article,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
that maybe a couple months
later, he comes to her home

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:90%
and waits in her garage.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:84%
When she got home, stabbed
her multiple times.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.219 align:middle line:84%
Ended up in the
hospital, almost died.

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
He left her for dead,
thought she was dead.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And then he left and
went to another state

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:90%
and killed another woman.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.077 align:middle line:90%
And so it was just devastating.

00:05:23.077 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And her contention is
they should be screening these

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.159 align:middle line:90%
people?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:90%
But how do you screen them?

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: You really can't.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:90%
You have to be-- they can't.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's millions
of people on there, right?

00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:33.974 align:middle line:84%
So as a woman, not to
blame the victim at all,

00:05:33.974 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
this is horrible, but
he knew where she lived.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.064 align:middle line:84%
This was some-- I would
never take a man home.

00:05:38.064 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: I would suggest
not to, until you're really--

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're really--

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.941 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: --know him.

00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:44.924 align:middle line:84%
And especially if
you have children.

00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:46.715 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want them
to know where I lived.

00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But so these
wacko things do happen?

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: They can happen.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.188 align:middle line:90%
You have to be careful.

00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:52.427 align:middle line:84%
Because anybody can get
on there, on the internet.

00:05:52.427 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's great, too.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.468 align:middle line:84%
I know people who have gotten
married from Match.com.

00:05:55.468 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a great resource.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.377 align:middle line:90%
So there's good and bad.

00:05:58.377 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, like you say,
people are trying to avoid

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
going into bars and places
to meet other people.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with the social
networking the way it is now,

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:84%
it's probably easy,
at least, to strike up

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:90%
a conversation with people.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I think of the case of
the Notre Dame linebacker

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:84%
who had this love affair going
with a fictitious person.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yes!

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How in the
heck does this happen?

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.898 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: You
know, I-- I don't know.

00:06:23.898 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, didn't
they Skype or something?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.885 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They were
doing everything.

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: You
know, I don't know.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And it went on
quite a long time.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean I
don't know, to this day,

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
if he finally caught on, until
it was too late, or what.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.199 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.615 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And
he's a busy guy.

00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who would be on
the other end doing that?

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could have been--
it could have been a guy.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:90%
It could have been anybody.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Could
have been a guy.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's, you know, kind
of, and especially when

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:84%
you're in the public, it's
pretty embarrassing, right?

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.475 align:middle line:84%
That he was pretty
embarrassed by that.

00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But with
today's relationships,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:90%
what are people looking for?

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, well,
I think it's the same.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I hear the same for
men and from women.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Women are looking
for-- the first thing

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that they ask for
is a sense of humor.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.164 align:middle line:84%
Love a guy with a-- if I
can make a woman laugh,

00:07:07.164 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
she can overlook--
he doesn't need

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:84%
to look like Brad Pitt
or George Clooney, right?

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.995 align:middle line:84%
Women, their
specifics tend to be,

00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:16.662 align:middle line:84%
they like a taller
man than themselves.

00:07:16.662 --> 00:07:18.120 align:middle line:84%
That goes back to
our caveman days,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:90%
where we want to be protected.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.006 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: So height
always can be an issue.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Funny, and someone who
has something going on,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:84%
success, meaning they
can take care of a family

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
if they have one,
something like that.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And men, of course,
they're visual.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's looks first, right?

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.746 align:middle line:84%
They want to know that they
like how she looks first.

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:37.745 align:middle line:84%
And then they will love
a woman who's easygoing,

00:07:37.745 --> 00:07:40.833 align:middle line:84%
who can go with the flow,
also a sense of humor.

00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you know, I
had a friend of mine who took

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
a girl to a restaurant
first time they met.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.255 align:middle line:84%
And she ordered a
$500 bottle of wine.

00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, no.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:90%
First date?

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: First date.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:90%
First date.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And he, of course, didn't
even know the price

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:90%
until he got the bill.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And he was mortified.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Never dated her again.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Why would she do that to him?

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, this is--
was this in LA by any chance?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was in LA.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And I'm a
matchmaker in Southern

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And there tends to be some high
maintenance ladies out there,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.669 align:middle line:84%
And the more
beautiful the woman,

00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:84%
they get a lot of
opportunities and they're

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:90%
dating the wealthy guys.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.522 align:middle line:84%
And they think that
they're entitled to that.

00:08:27.522 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty sad,
because the truth is,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the guys aren't going to ask
them out for a second date.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How important
is money, finances,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we, as guys, we hear
all kinds of things about women,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that some of them may be
gold diggers, others are not.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:90%
But how important is that?

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well it's, and
especially I see it in the big

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:90%
cities, you know.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.542 align:middle line:84%
So in LA the women will
see the Red Carpet events.

00:08:55.542 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:84%
They'll see the guys with the
private jets and the Bentleys

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.848 align:middle line:90%
They think, well I want that.

00:08:59.848 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:90%
I deserve that.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So that can even be
a block for women,

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.215 align:middle line:84%
when they're waiting for
a guy with a lot of money.

00:09:05.215 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a recession
and everyone has got to work.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big deal.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And in a relationship
it's a big deal.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.310 align:middle line:84%
You've got to talk about those
things before you get married,

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.177 align:middle line:84%
because you want to find out,
is your significant other,

00:09:19.177 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:90%
is he in debt?

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
What do they think
about marriage?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.656 align:middle line:84%
What do you think about
saving for retirement?

00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:24.119 align:middle line:84%
These are big
things that come up,

00:09:24.119 --> 00:09:26.410 align:middle line:84%
problems in a marriage, if
you didn't discuss it first.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Money
doesn't make you happy.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:84%
It makes it easy, but it
doesn't make you happy.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: It
doesn't make you happy.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
You hear about people with a lot
of money and they're miserable.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're miserable.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, you have to
be happy with yourself first,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.950 align:middle line:84%
before you get in
a relationship.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
When you're happy
with your life,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, then you're happy with
however much money you have.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's do a little
screening test.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume I come
to you as a client.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: All right.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's this
going to cost me?

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: George, what's
your limit on your credit card?

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.509 align:middle line:90%
Just kidding.

00:09:58.509 --> 00:09:59.550 align:middle line:90%
So what are you looking--

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.828 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mine is maxed.

00:10:00.828 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: All right.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.584 align:middle line:84%
So I would want to know
what your history has been.

00:10:05.584 --> 00:10:06.292 align:middle line:90%
Are you divorced?

00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Have you been married before?

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're gotten to your age
now without ever being married,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.579 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking for?

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.078 align:middle line:84%
What age range are
you looking for?

00:10:14.078 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you have kids?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.107 align:middle line:90%
Do you want kids?

00:10:16.107 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So I need to know
all of these things,

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
because let's say,
you never had any kids

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.874 align:middle line:84%
and you would like
to have a family.

00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have to
look for women in, probably,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.962 align:middle line:90%
in her '30s for you.

00:10:24.962 --> 00:10:26.420 align:middle line:84%
You know '40s is
not going to work.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you have
to go that in depth?

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: I do, because
they want a life partner.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.805 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
considerations.

00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:33.597 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And if guy
doesn't want a family?

00:10:33.597 --> 00:10:36.096 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Right, so maybe
he'll date a woman who already

00:10:36.096 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:84%
has children, or someone
who could go either way,

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.929 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Huh!

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:90%
So you screen him.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:90%
You ask him questions.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.915 align:middle line:90%
Do you put it in a computer?

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: No,
you know, well,

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I have some things
on the computer.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:90%
But I make a nice bio on him.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.856 align:middle line:90%
And I type that up.

00:10:49.856 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have pictures, so that
when I send it to the woman,

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.490 align:middle line:90%
it's all in a nice format.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All right,
who's got the approval?

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
The guy over the girl, or
the girl over the client?

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, usually,
the men are my paying clients,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And I do send it to him first.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, I
have this great lady.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And I give him a
bio and picture.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Would you be interested?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
If he says yes, then
I'll send her his info.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
If she says, yes, then
I give him her number.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you ever sent
a bio out without the picture

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.136 align:middle line:90%
first?

00:11:13.136 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: I've tried,
because some people

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:90%
aren't photogenic.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know that they're going
to like this person, right?

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.209 align:middle line:84%
But guys are so visual, rarely
will they take my word for it.

00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, that's
what you hired me for.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.301 align:middle line:84%
If you want to pick
people out of pictures,

00:11:28.301 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:90%
go on the internet.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But they still want
to see the photos.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So if that makes them
comfortable, then I do that.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I've got friends
who would go on the dating

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.610 align:middle line:84%
services years ago, and they
would go on a date and come

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
back and say, it was
not the same person.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%
It was a different picture.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're upset, or
something didn't work out.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Why would somebody do that?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.605 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: That
happened to me once.

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:54.267 align:middle line:84%
Oh, before I met my
husband, I went on Love@AOL

00:11:54.267 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
because my cousin and my aunts
insisted, you've got to try it,

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.725 align:middle line:90%
you've got to try it.

00:11:57.725 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:84%
It was after I moved
back from Chicago.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I saw this guy,
he looked so cute,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.046 align:middle line:84%
with these lips that
were just full lips.

00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And I could just picture
myself kissing those lips.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You look
for a guy's lips?

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, I just
liked his lips, all right?

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't looking for
them, but I thought,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.804 align:middle line:90%
this guy looks really cute.

00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:13.672 align:middle line:90%
We spoke on the phone.

00:12:13.672 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Something about his
voice and personality

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.850 align:middle line:90%
didn't match that picture.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.634 align:middle line:84%
And then when I met
him, he had thin lips.

00:12:20.634 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well maybe
his Botox wore off.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Or whether they put in there.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, deflated.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:90%
And then I said, you know what?

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I said, you really don't
look like your picture.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.755 align:middle line:84%
And then he's, oh, well,
that was an old picture,

00:12:28.755 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and my hair was lighter,
and brushing it off.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And about an hour into
it I said, I'm sorry,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
but you really don't
look like your picture.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
I'll admit, that I

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.922 align:middle line:90%
put a model's picture up there.

00:12:39.922 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: And I said, why?

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It wasn't
him him, at all?

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.278 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: No.

00:12:43.278 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And he says,
because I'm a doctor

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.385 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want anybody at
the hospital to see my picture.

00:12:47.385 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, then
don't put a picture up.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And I said, well,
if you're that embarrassed you

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be up there.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.021 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: And he says, hey.

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
He says, Marla, some woman
actually got me get mad at me

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:90%
when they find out.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I was pretty
nice about it.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take some
questions for you, OK?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Marla Martenson, the
Beverly Hills Matchmaker,

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:90%
who's got a question for her?

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I know somebody
wants to date, right?

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Marla, what's
the process you used to pick

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:90%
your husband?

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, the
process that I used?

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
This was great, because
I met my husband

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.114 align:middle line:84%
after I had-- so I had
been married prior.

00:13:20.114 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I had
five years of being

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:90%
single when I was in Chicago.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:90%
And then I came back to LA.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I was single, I
was dating all the bad boys,

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I was always getting
my heart broken.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was used to
guys going out with me

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and then never calling
again, which a lot of women

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:90%
have experienced.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when I met him,
through a mutual friend,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
we hit it off right away and
he seemed to really like me.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.454 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind I was like, maybe
he'll-- I figured he probably

00:13:46.454 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:90%
won't ever call again.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.244 align:middle line:84%
So I said, if he calls
again, he calls again.

00:13:49.244 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:90%
If he doesn't, he doesn't.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.427 align:middle line:84%
And I was really working
on myself at the time.

00:13:52.427 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
My father had passed
away, I was doing

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:84%
a lot of healing and
working on my career

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and my spiritual
side, and everything.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting, because
he just kept calling every day.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.672 align:middle line:84%
And within three weeks
it was my birthday,

00:14:04.672 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and he had a birthday
party for me.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was introducing me to
his friends as his girlfriend.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.880 align:middle line:90%
This is my girlfriend, Marla.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.317 align:middle line:84%
And using the words we
in our future-- well, we.

00:14:13.317 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You pick
up on those things.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, you pick
up on those things which other

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:90%
guys never did.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that he
was really serious.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And he was just a great guy.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was dating a couple
of girls when he met me.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.538 align:middle line:84%
And my friend who introduced
us said, you know what, Marla?

00:14:26.538 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
He called those girls the
week he met you and told them

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
that he couldn't
see them anymore,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:90%
because met somewhat special.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: So that's,
yeah, meant a lot.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.518 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, that was also
a classy gesture on his part,

00:14:35.518 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:90%
to let them know.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, to let them
know, instead of just never,

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:90%
never calling again.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:39.822 align:middle line:90%
You see, guys?

00:14:39.822 --> 00:14:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Most guys
would just fade away.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Because
girls are always saying,

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
why do guys say they'll
call, then they never call?

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's a big mind
thing for us women.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.614 align:middle line:90%
We're like, confused.

00:14:49.614 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I love that.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.578 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some more
questions for Marla.

00:14:52.578 --> 00:14:55.160 align:middle line:84%
How about from some of
the women in our audience?

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.896 align:middle line:90%
Anybody have a question?

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: What do
you recommend for the 40

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:90%
somethings?

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
It seems like an age group
that's kind of neglected.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, the
40's are fantastic.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.099 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's no
reason to be neglected.

00:15:08.099 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Just get out there.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of my men want
to date women in their 40's.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.593 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're open to
dating a little bit older than

00:15:13.593 --> 00:15:15.485 align:middle line:84%
yourself, if you'll
go up into the 50's.

00:15:15.485 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean the men love the
women in their 40's.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:90%
We still look great.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:90%
We're smart.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.805 align:middle line:90%
We're confident.

00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:90%
We feel good in our own skin.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a really great time.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're more mature.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: More mature,
and just do a lot of work

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:90%
on yourself.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.356 align:middle line:84%
I say, always keep
learning and expanding.

00:15:28.356 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:90%
And keep yourself in shape.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.276 align:middle line:90%
Men are visual.

00:15:30.276 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women don't
like to hear this,

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.024 align:middle line:90%
but they are really visual.

00:15:33.024 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can keep
yourself healthy, in shape,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.095 align:middle line:90%
and looking fresh.

00:15:37.095 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Because that's when we
start to get a little gray.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.095 align:middle line:84%
And so, keep an updated look
and take care of yourself,

00:15:42.095 --> 00:15:43.855 align:middle line:90%
and there should be no problem.

00:15:43.855 --> 00:15:45.907 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Marla, sometimes
we see mismatches

00:15:45.907 --> 00:15:46.615 align:middle line:90%
in relationships.

00:15:46.615 --> 00:15:49.462 align:middle line:84%
You know, people will look
at a couple and go, whoa!

00:15:49.462 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing together?

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.456 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: What's
she doing with him?

00:15:52.456 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And vice versa.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:90%
But how does that happen?

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's that attraction?

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, you know,
like for instance, women--

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:90%
we love a guy's sense of humor.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Listen, if he is powerful in
his work, and he's intelligent

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and he's funny, he could
look a little funny.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it's sexy.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So it could look
like a mismatch.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, remember Dudley
Moore and Susan Anton?

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well,
he was adorable.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:84%
But he was like 5,
2 and she was 5,11.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, she was huge.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.191 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And people were
like, how does this work?

00:16:20.191 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But it works,
because these people

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:90%
are looking for qualities.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's because he had
a step stool wherever he went.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: He
had a step stool.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:84%
He had a little step ladder
he carried in his back pocket.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.298 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How about one more?

00:16:29.298 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
One more question for Marla,
here, before we continue.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: So
in Beverly Hills,

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:84%
it can be a little materialistic
and/or like self-serving.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever have to
talk to your clients

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, a relationship is
about helping the other person

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.487 align:middle line:84%
and doing right by them,
and not being selfish?

00:16:45.487 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Have you had to kind of
correct them and say, hey,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.992 align:middle line:84%
your expectations
are unrealistic?

00:16:48.992 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: I give
some great question.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.575 align:middle line:90%
I give some coaching.

00:16:51.575 --> 00:16:54.352 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have had women come
in and say-- I had one woman,

00:16:54.352 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:90%
she was probably in her 50's.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:84%
She comes in and she says, I
want to meet a billionaire.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.882 align:middle line:90%
And she was absolutely adamant.

00:16:59.882 --> 00:17:01.464 align:middle line:84%
I says, you know,
well, for one thing,

00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
billionaires in my roster.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And so people will
get caught up in that,

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:84%
because you see a
lot of it out there.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I have to remind
them, just because a man is

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.084 align:middle line:84%
jet-setting around, these
guys have this lifestyle

00:17:15.084 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
where they can date the most
exquisite women in the world.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:84%
You see these guys are
dating the top models, right?

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to
compete with that, good luck.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
And they change, you know,
they, what do you call it?

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.467 align:middle line:90%
Go up.

00:17:28.467 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The guy's?

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON:
Yeah, you trade up.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Upscale?

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Upscale, upgrade.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, they could
date whoever they want.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.950 align:middle line:84%
It's really, it would be a
really stressful situation,

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I think, to date
a guy like that.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.459 align:middle line:90%
They're traveling a lot.

00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and they
might not be interested in one

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: That's
what I'm saying.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They may not be
interested in a relationship.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:84%
You want somebody who
is going to be there

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:84%
when times are rough,
to grow old with.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:90%
What if you get sick?

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.235 align:middle line:84%
What if you lose
an arm or a leg?

00:17:53.235 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.151 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to leave
you if something happens?

00:17:56.151 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So what I would
really look for are

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
qualities, characters
in a person.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you want
to be attracted.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Everybody does.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.425 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is the institution
of a relationship passe?

00:18:07.425 --> 00:18:08.912 align:middle line:90%
Or is it still there?

00:18:08.912 --> 00:18:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: You
know, it's still there.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot more people
are living together,

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:90%
not getting married.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think, still,
women, we grew up

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.084 align:middle line:90%
with that fairy tale idea.

00:18:19.084 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
When I was little
girl, I remember

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:90%
reading about Cinderella.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I used to even
pretend I was a princess.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Prince Charming's going
to ride up on his white horse.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And we still kind of
think that, today.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.442 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's where
that, we call it "shallowness"

00:18:32.442 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:84%
comes in, thinking
somebody's going

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to swoop in and save
us or take care of us.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Or he's going to
look like a prince.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's just really,
it's really a fairy tale.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.370 align:middle line:90%
The romantic comedies, too.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:90%
They feed into that.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.851 align:middle line:84%
I always thought,
oh, the perfect guy

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:84%
would be Tom Hanks
in "You've Got Mail."

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.029 align:middle line:84%
But no, that's just
a scripted movie.

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So you showed us how
you screen your clients.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.019 align:middle line:84%
How do you screen the
prospective woman?

00:18:58.019 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well,
the women the same way.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I meet the women, and I talk
to them, get to know them.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.429 align:middle line:84%
Over the years,
you know, the women

00:19:05.429 --> 00:19:07.720 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're friends,
that we're friends together.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I get feedback
after each date.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So if a woman
misbehaves, let's say,

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
she orders a $500 bottle
of wine on the first date.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He tells
you about that.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: He
tells me about it.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's like adios, you know?

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:90%
No more matches for you.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Do you dump them?

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.459 align:middle line:90%
That's inappropriate.

00:19:22.459 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Or if somebody
does something like that,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:90%
I can coach them.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.872 align:middle line:84%
If they apologize and say,
OK, that was out of line.

00:19:30.872 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, I might
match them again.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.976 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But it's still
inside of them, isn't it?

00:19:33.976 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, if that's
their character, you know?

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And I really care
about my clients.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I want them to find
the right person.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And if that's going on,
that's just such a sense

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.510 align:middle line:90%
of entitlement.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And like you said,
it's just rude.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are people
scammed sometimes?

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you have someone
who comes in and tricks you,

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:90%
or tries to?

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.597 align:middle line:84%
Some guy who isn't
who he says he is?

00:19:55.597 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Thank goodness,
I haven't had that happen.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.112 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, I
go to my clients' homes.

00:20:00.112 --> 00:20:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I love to meet them
at their house,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
because I like to see
how-- I can tell the women,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.176 align:middle line:90%
I've been to his home.

00:20:04.176 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:90%
It's beautifully decorated.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Or he takes me to
lunch or dinner,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:84%
so I kind of see
how they interact.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And when they're paying that
kind of money for a matchmaker,

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.865 align:middle line:84%
they pretty much are
who they say they are.

00:20:13.865 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:84%
On the internet, it could
be a little more sketchy.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Right,
I would think so.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
A little bit later
on, we're going

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:84%
to pick somebody out of the
audience and do an example.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.695 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, OK.

00:20:21.695 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
to-- that we do that.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:84%
What would you
recommend to people

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:84%
right now who are not
going through matchmaking,

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.884 align:middle line:90%
who might not be able to?

00:20:30.884 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
How do they meet
the right person?

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well,
you know what I love?

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.871 align:middle line:90%
I always talk about meetup.com.

00:20:35.871 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I know, I think,
in the states,

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.605 align:middle line:84%
they are in pretty much
every state, meetup.com.

00:20:41.605 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:84%
They have all sorts
of groups, Meet Ups,

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:84%
where if you like hiking, if
you're a book club, into wine

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
tastings, want to
learn another language.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Anything you want to do,
they've got a Meet Up for it.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Singles groups, or you
could even start your own.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.538 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
out there meeting people

00:20:55.538 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:90%
with your same interests.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So instead of going out
in the world thinking,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
where's my soul mate, if
you're at a restaurant

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.257 align:middle line:84%
and/or a bar and
somebody walks in--

00:21:03.257 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:84%
instead of turning your head
like Linda Blair, you know?

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Looking right, is that him?

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Is he coming through the door?--
with that kind of desperation.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Just go out and live
your life and have fun.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Aways keep learning.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Put the word out to your
friends that you're available.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.192 align:middle line:84%
I met my husband
through a friend.

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Friends help.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Friends help.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:90%
They got your back.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes friends--

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.029 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Uh-oh.

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Guys
will tell me this.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
They say, they're matching me
up with their female friends,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.844 align:middle line:84%
but they're not the
look that I like.

00:21:27.844 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Because they like them,
they think they're gorgeous.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:90%
But they're not my type.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's why sometimes
they come to me, as well.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I have heard that
when a woman thinks of a guy

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.910 align:middle line:84%
as a friend, it's the
kiss of death for him.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:40.712 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:21:40.712 --> 00:21:42.045 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: You're a nice guy.

00:21:42.045 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:90%
I used to get that.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:90%
And they say, oh, no.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell me I'm a nice guy.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the worst.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:90%
That means you have no interest.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be a nice guy.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.630 align:middle line:90%
I want to be a bad boy.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do you see
this-- these mismatches,

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:84%
where a woman is with
a guy who is a bad guy,

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.739 align:middle line:84%
who might even hit her
and do these things.

00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And they hang in
these relationships.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.154 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: I know.

00:22:09.154 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I hung in relationships
like that.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I was never hit, but the
verbal abuse, jealousy, things

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:19.780 align:middle line:84%
In our 20's, we're basically
animals run on hormones, right?

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are dealing
with a lot of hormones.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And that will
affect our choices.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it the
self-esteem, a low self-esteem?

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.701 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: The low
self-esteem, and, you know,

00:22:30.701 --> 00:22:33.690 align:middle line:84%
women, we have that oxytocin
that's a bonding hormone,

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.194 align:middle line:84%
where, when you make
love it attaches us.

00:22:37.194 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's very tricky.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So when guys, keep
this in mind, if you

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.119 align:middle line:84%
want to have sex with
a woman early on.

00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Bring oxytocin.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, that
oxytocin is going to be

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:90%
released.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:90%
And she's going to bond to you.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if you just are
going to do a dump,

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.314 align:middle line:84%
you know, love 'em
and leave em, that's

00:22:52.314 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:90%
how you might get a stalker.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:90%
But we do tend to bond.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And even if they're
treating us bad,

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
we're just like,
coming back for more.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there a
technique to dating?

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.534 align:middle line:84%
Is there something that would
be good for tips for people?

00:23:07.534 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, go
out there and have fun.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.427 align:middle line:84%
When you go on a first
date, I say, arrive

00:23:11.427 --> 00:23:13.010 align:middle line:84%
on the first date
with the expectation

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to have a great time

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.281 align:middle line:90%
and meet an interesting person.

00:23:15.281 --> 00:23:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Not with the expectation and
the burden on that person that,

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:90%
are you my soul mate.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.046 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you're a
woman in your late 30's

00:23:21.046 --> 00:23:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and your clock is ticking,
and you're dying to have kids,

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
you don't ask the guy--
I've had women do this.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
The first question,
do you want kids?

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
don't want kids, I

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:90%
don't even know why we're here.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, gosh.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: You know, that.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And the guy is
like, I don't even

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.881 align:middle line:84%
know if I want a second date
with you, let alone father

00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:90%
your children.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.656 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I did
go on a date once.

00:23:37.656 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Once.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.072 align:middle line:84%
And the woman said, at
dinner, I hate animals.

00:23:44.072 --> 00:23:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh!

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now that was
a deal-breaker for me.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: That would
be a deal-breaker for me.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You don't
have to own one,

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.340 align:middle line:84%
because of the
lifestyle we all have.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:90%
But she said, I hate animals.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Dogs are stinky and
I don't like cats.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I actually paid the
dinner and left.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, this is
not going to go anywhere.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.264 align:middle line:84%
If you hate an animal,
how do you treat humans?

00:24:04.264 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Exactly.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So I moved on,
on something like that.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I had another friend
of mine, his father

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:84%
had sold the business,
made $170 million,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:90%
a pharmaceutical company.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And set up trusts for
his sister and himself.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So this guy must have been
32 years old, had $40 million

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:90%
in a trust account.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.780 align:middle line:90%
It was his.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:90%
And he drew on it every month.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Yet, was the worst for
relationships I have ever seen.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
He would call me,
Marla, 10 times a day.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:84%
It got to the point where
I couldn't take it anymore.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And he flew to Los Angeles
one day, and he said,

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I just want to have
a great weekend.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:90%
I just want to meet people.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:84%
As God is my judge, he
stayed at a nice hotel

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and went upstairs and changed
his outfit, his clothes,

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.510 align:middle line:90%
10 times.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:04.030 align:middle line:84%
He would come down and say,
do you like this shirt?

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:90%
What about these pants?

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.390 align:middle line:90%
To me!

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask me.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, they're fine.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, he would say,
well, I don't like it,

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and he would go upstairs
and change again.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.515 align:middle line:90%
10 times.

00:25:14.515 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: 10 times.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:90%
The 10 times man.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I looked
at this guy saying,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
if he's got $40
million in the bank,

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:84%
got to be one of the most
neurotic people I know.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Nice guy, but, I mean,
you can't fix that.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And he got married to
a girl, right away.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:90%
They got divorced in a year.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Got married again, had a baby.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:90%
She divorced him, right away.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So now he's got this huge
child support payment.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work for him.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Now if he came to you, with
his check in hand and said,

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.162 align:middle line:84%
find me someone, you'd
have a tough time finding

00:25:49.162 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:90%
somebody for him.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Right.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And he could be-- I've had
guys, they're gorgeous.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:90%
They're tall.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything on paper,
tall, dark, handsome, and rich.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
these kind of issues.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, he's not
handsome and he's not tall.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.402 align:middle line:90%
But he's got $40 million.

00:26:02.402 --> 00:26:04.693 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Hey, he's a
lot taller when he's standing

00:26:04.693 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:90%
on his wallet.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, he is.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.930 align:middle line:84%
But little-- look
how that got him.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: I do have some
wonderful dating coaches that

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.690 align:middle line:90%
are on my team.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I will send some of my
clients to a dating coach.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.625 align:middle line:84%
And I always offer
that in the package.

00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, you can take
advantage of that, if you want.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Or if I see some patterns
like this, I will say,

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.081 align:middle line:84%
I would really like
you to see a coach.

00:26:25.081 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you ever had a
coach come back to you go, oh,

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Marla, we got a
lot of work here.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, George,
a lot of the men--

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I have some wonderful clients.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:90%
I love my clients.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.486 align:middle line:84%
We're like a little
family, right?

00:26:37.486 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%
But some people, the
reason they come to me

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
is because they have
some issues like this.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.301 align:middle line:84%
And they're not getting
the success on their own.

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And just because you pay a
matchmaker-- I always say,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a magician,
I'm a matchmaker.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And I can only present
you with people,

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.015 align:middle line:84%
I can get you the resources
and tools to help you,

00:26:53.015 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:84%
but if you've got issues, you're
going to have to work on them.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.806 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, here's a
difficult question for you.

00:26:57.806 --> 00:27:01.098 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever rejected
someone because you

00:27:01.098 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
knew there's nothing
you could do for them?

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And there they are
with their check,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.664 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whatever you
charged as a fee.

00:27:06.664 --> 00:27:07.455 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:27:07.455 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I keep a small list of people
I really want to work with,

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:90%
and feel that I can help.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
If I don't think I can match
them, I won't take them.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, they're
going to want their money back.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll be frustrated.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.063 align:middle line:84%
Or I won't be able to
sleep at night, right?

00:27:18.063 --> 00:27:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So I had a man call me, he
was in his late 60's, and he

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:90%
wanted to date women 25 to 33.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.845 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm sorry,
I don't do that.

00:27:28.845 --> 00:27:30.720 align:middle line:84%
The women that I have
wouldn't date your age,

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:84%
unless they were, you know, a
gold digger or something else.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And so that's not what I do.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:36.976 align:middle line:90%
So I turned him down.

00:27:36.976 --> 00:27:37.476 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:37.476 --> 00:27:38.101 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good.

00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
What has been, for you,
the most satisfying aspect

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.209 align:middle line:90%
of what you do?

00:27:44.209 --> 00:27:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, when
people get married, of course,

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And I went to just a
lovely wedding once,

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.086 align:middle line:84%
and they had a rose
sitting on the chair for me

00:27:53.086 --> 00:27:54.460 align:middle line:84%
when I was watching
the ceremony.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.219 align:middle line:84%
When I got back to my
seat there's a gift.

00:27:56.219 --> 00:27:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And they brought me
up and introduced

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:90%
me, a champagne toast.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it was
just, they were so happy.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
most rewarding part.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's got
some magic to it.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: It's
got some magic to it.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a people person.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:90%
I love people.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.158 align:middle line:84%
So just meeting all
these different kinds

00:28:10.158 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:84%
of people with different
jobs and lifestyles

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and different parts of
the, sometimes, country,

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes world.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I have had clients
down in Mexico.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's really fun.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.585 align:middle line:90%
A guy in Hawaii.

00:28:21.585 --> 00:28:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're an author.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.610 align:middle line:84%
You're a very
accomplished author.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:90%
What's your latest book?

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: My latest book--

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Excuse me.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.586 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, "Excuse
Me, Your Soul Mate is Waiting"

00:28:29.586 --> 00:28:32.400 align:middle line:90%
is my first book.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Then I had "Good
Date, Bad Date."

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I did two memoirs,
"Diary of a Beverly Hills

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.521 align:middle line:84%
Matchmaker," and the sequel,
"Hearts on the Line."

00:28:39.521 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, "Excuse
Me, Your Soul Mate.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.440 align:middle line:84%
is Waiting" has
been a great book.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:84%
It incorporates a
lot of attraction

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.944 align:middle line:90%
with finding your soul mate.

00:28:45.944 --> 00:28:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me about
the Law of Attraction.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, I'm a
big Law of Attraction girl.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:84%
That's how I-- I co-create
everything in my life

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.510 align:middle line:90%
with the universe.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:54.252 align:middle line:90%
It's so much fun.

00:28:54.252 --> 00:28:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure a lot
of your viewers,

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.360 align:middle line:84%
if they're watching Gaiam
TV, they're into that.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's really what you
think about you bring about.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.079 align:middle line:84%
It's raising your vibration to
match what you're looking for.

00:29:04.079 --> 00:29:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So of course, you
don't want to think

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:90%
about what you don't want.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.386 align:middle line:84%
So when a woman has been
dating, maybe divorced,

00:29:10.386 --> 00:29:11.760 align:middle line:84%
maybe her husband
cheated on her,

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:84%
so she's got these negative
ideas about dating, about men,

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and upset about not
finding the right person.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Even though she's
out there looking,

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:22.689 align:middle line:84%
but when you have that mindset,
you're not going to find it.

00:29:22.689 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So once you switch
that switch and look

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.867 align:middle line:84%
forward to meeting that person,
feeling good, being happy,

00:29:29.867 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that's when you're going
to meet the right person.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It happens.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yes.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.140 align:middle line:90%
And it will happen, it will.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And how difficult is
it to keep that relationship

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
going, in this era
where things happen?

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And we've all gone
through those things.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: We
have to realize that,

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:84%
now that we're partners
and we're both working--

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.940 align:middle line:90%
my husband and I both work.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:84%
We both have to split
the household chores.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.130 align:middle line:84%
We have a dog,
there's things to do.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can't just let it
fall on the other person.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And have compassion
for that other person.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Because we're working hard.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:90%
We've got a lot to do.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to just snip
at each other and argue.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So of course, you're
going to have arguments.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.119 align:middle line:84%
But my husband always says, he
learned from somebody, the best

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:10.410 align:middle line:84%
way to have a great marriage
is to have a short memory.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:11.718 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:11.718 --> 00:30:12.415 align:middle line:90%
He' right.

00:30:12.415 --> 00:30:12.915 align:middle line:90%
He's right.

00:30:12.915 --> 00:30:14.331 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And
as we get older,

00:30:14.331 --> 00:30:16.230 align:middle line:90%
that's not so hard to do.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In this era
of social networking,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.654 align:middle line:84%
people will text each
other more than they talk.

00:30:21.654 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, yes.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: People
will be on Facebook.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Things will be misunderstood.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.856 align:middle line:84%
I've gone to dinner
sometimes, as a matter

00:30:31.856 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:84%
of fact, where
your husband plays

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:90%
the piano in Beverly Hills.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And he's a good piano
player, by the way.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen
couples of two or four

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.400 align:middle line:84%
sending text messages to
people, all four of them

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:90%
have their phones.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And not one of them
is talking to each other.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Not one.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're just sending
their text messages.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.540 align:middle line:84%
What has that done
to relationships?

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well,
even myself, I'm guilty.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.983 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my husband
will get mad at me,

00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:02.850 align:middle line:84%
because I'm kind of
working seven days a week.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.109 align:middle line:84%
My clients can email
me or text me any time.

00:31:05.109 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, I work
from my home office.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm very boutique.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be out to breakfast--
every Sunday morning,

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.620 align:middle line:84%
we go for our Mexican breakfast,
and that's our time together.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.850 align:middle line:84%
We have a great Mexican
place in the Valley we go to.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be on my phone
answering something.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.030 align:middle line:84%
He's like, honey,
this is our breakfast.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Put the phone away!

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Put that away.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Put that down.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.785 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, then I
realize, that's pretty rude.

00:31:22.785 --> 00:31:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He's right.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, he's right.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.658 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sorry, honey.

00:31:25.658 --> 00:31:26.514 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But you're addicted.

00:31:26.514 --> 00:31:27.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're doing
your work and stuff.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: It's just so--
and I was doing it with some

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:31.180 align:middle line:90%
friends this weekend.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this is
not, you know, right.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:90%
We went out dancing.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I'm
texting my clients.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is, put it
down and go dance!

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah,
have a good time.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.708 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: But it
can run first dates.

00:31:41.708 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I've had people-- you cannot
understand the tone somebody

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.942 align:middle line:84%
has, or if somebody
tells a joke in the text,

00:31:46.942 --> 00:31:47.900 align:middle line:90%
you might get it wrong.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.285 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:31:48.285 --> 00:31:50.659 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And I've had
people not meet because of it.

00:31:50.659 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I have had people-- texts not
go through, they never met.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.842 align:middle line:84%
Or guys, especially
the younger guys

00:31:54.842 --> 00:31:56.800 align:middle line:84%
in their 20's or 30's,
they're so into texting,

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.917 align:middle line:84%
they'll make their first contact
with a women through a text.

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's a sign
of the the times.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Pick up the phone.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They don't
do that anymore.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: We don't do it.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.745 align:middle line:84%
We're all hiding behind
emails and texts.

00:32:05.745 --> 00:32:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I've
got to tell you,

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.550 align:middle line:84%
in what I do with "Coast
to Coast" for example,

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:90%
and then my personal life.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.750 align:middle line:84%
If I talked to
everyone who sends me

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.240 align:middle line:84%
a text message during the
day, I would get nothing done.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The phone would be
ringing constantly.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
just a few days ago,

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:84%
what life was like
before cellphones.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.265 align:middle line:84%
Before we even had the
big Motorola ones, right?

00:32:27.265 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: I know.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And you know what?

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:29.490 align:middle line:90%
We got by

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: We got along.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:90%
We got by.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We did
what we had to do.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: We had
answering machines.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We got back to
our office and took care

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.060 align:middle line:84%
of our messages and
did what we had to do.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.380 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, you
just try, one day,

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.990 align:middle line:90%
keep your cell phone at home.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.620 align:middle line:90%
You feel naked.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: George,
when I'm out in the world,

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.430 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I'll look
on the street and see,

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.962 align:middle line:84%
everybody's down like this,
or like this, on the street.

00:32:48.962 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every
other-- every person.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In Nevada, they're
thinking of passing a law which

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:58.180 align:middle line:84%
would make it illegal to
send text messaging or to use

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:84%
your smartphone
while you're walking.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Because people will walk on--
they'll walk on the street

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and get hit by a car,
because they're not looking.

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:06.430 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:07.388 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: And trip.

00:33:07.388 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So so
the social network,

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:84%
though it has speeded things
up, in terms of information--

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I know when Michael
Jackson died,

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.980 align:middle line:84%
the world knew
about it in minutes,

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:84%
through social networking--
it also can destroy

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.140 align:middle line:90%
a relationship, can't it?

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.015 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: It can.

00:33:21.015 --> 00:33:23.566 align:middle line:84%
And it just disconnects
us from our relationships.

00:33:23.566 --> 00:33:24.940 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there's things

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:84%
like Skype, which,
I love, because I

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.890 align:middle line:90%
have girlfriends in France.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:29.902 align:middle line:84%
I have girlfriends in
Canada and Chicago.

00:33:29.902 --> 00:33:31.360 align:middle line:84%
We sit there with
our cup of coffee

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.901 align:middle line:84%
like we're sitting
in the living room

00:33:32.901 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
together, looking at
each other, on Skype.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.000 align:middle line:90%
And so that's just awesome.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So technology has the
good and bad sides.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.314 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Facebook
creates problems, as well.

00:33:41.314 --> 00:33:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: People are
on there, constantly.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Constantly,
they'll get messages.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:84%
A married couple will see
the messages of someone

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.070 align:middle line:84%
who put something on
someone else's Facebook.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.700 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Or you
look at the status,

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.033 align:middle line:84%
the relationship status,
if you're dating someone.

00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:56.087 align:middle line:90%
Oh no, he's still single.

00:33:56.087 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They haven't
changed it yet.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Still
hasn't changed the status.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:33:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And then
you've got to block people.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That happens.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.626 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Unfriend them.

00:34:01.626 --> 00:34:03.145 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So do
away with that too.

00:34:03.145 --> 00:34:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Then
you're all hurt.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:90%
I was unfriended.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.866 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So do you deal with
that stuff, social networking?

00:34:07.866 --> 00:34:09.449 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Social
networking, yeah.

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:11.836 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes, see, so I'm
trying to match somebody,

00:34:11.836 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll go do
their investigating and look

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.989 align:middle line:84%
somebody up on Facebook or
try to see more pictures.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:17.488 align:middle line:84%
And say, oh, no,
I'm not-- you know,

00:34:17.488 --> 00:34:19.040 align:middle line:90%
they're not my type, after all.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:19.909 align:middle line:90%
And don't do that!

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:20.909 align:middle line:90%
You've got to trust me.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:21.929 align:middle line:90%
I know these people.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Go.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:90%
It's only a date, right?

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.999 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: You paid
me, let me do my job.

00:34:25.999 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:90%
Yes, go.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many dates do you
give someone for whatever fee

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.520 align:middle line:90%
they end up giving you?

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, usually
someone will join for a year.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.292 align:middle line:84%
And I give one to
two matches a month.

00:34:36.292 --> 00:34:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, if somebody
is really easy to match,

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:42.335 align:middle line:84%
like they're just easier, let's
say, tall, dark, and handsome,

00:34:42.335 --> 00:34:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and every woman would
want to meet him.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I'll match him a lot
more, just because--

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.427 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And how do you
solicit the women for him?

00:34:49.427 --> 00:34:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, I
have a large database.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.190 align:middle line:90%
I've been doing it a long time.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.935 align:middle line:84%
So I have over 300
women in the database.

00:34:53.935 --> 00:34:55.060 align:middle line:90%
And then i have recruiters.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I have other matchmakers
I network with.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The women in my database,
if they like my service,

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.347 align:middle line:90%
they send their friends.

00:35:01.347 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And so there's women coming
to me every week, new women.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are there any
women who are frustrated,

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:84%
who say to you, stop
sending me these guys?

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:10.741 align:middle line:90%
Or anything like that?

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: No, but sometimes
they'll take a little break.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I had one woman
tell my recruiter,

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.600 align:middle line:84%
she says-- I set her
up with a great guy.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.187 align:middle line:84%
Texting, they messed
up, didn't meet.

00:35:21.187 --> 00:35:22.520 align:middle line:90%
And then I emailed my recruiter.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I said, what's going
on with this girl?

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.238 align:middle line:84%
And she says, oh,
I just called her

00:35:25.238 --> 00:35:27.151 align:middle line:84%
and she said that
God told her that she

00:35:27.151 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't be dating right now.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:28.835 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ooh.

00:35:28.835 --> 00:35:30.959 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: I said, better
listen to that big man

00:35:30.959 --> 00:35:31.815 align:middle line:90%
upstairs.

00:35:31.815 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If that's
what he's saying.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: If that's what
he's saying, take a break.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.946 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If that's what
he's saying, exactly.

00:35:35.946 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:84%
What advice would
you give the people

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.710 align:middle line:90%
who want to meet someone.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.240 align:middle line:84%
They might not
have the resources

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.060 align:middle line:84%
to go through a
matchmaker, like yourself.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:43.890 align:middle line:90%
What they do?

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, you can
get my book, "Excuse Me,

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.641 align:middle line:84%
Your Soul Mate is Waiting,"
and that will take you right

00:35:47.641 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:90%
through it.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need to
go through a matchmaker.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.110 align:middle line:84%
A matchmaker is not for
everyone, it really isn't.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.597 align:middle line:90%
But there are the online sites.

00:35:54.597 --> 00:35:55.680 align:middle line:90%
There are the meetup.coms.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.263 align:middle line:90%
Get out there.

00:35:56.263 --> 00:36:00.052 align:middle line:84%
If you like to dance, go to a
swing dance, or a salsa dance.

00:36:00.052 --> 00:36:02.010 align:middle line:84%
When I was living in
Chicago, and I was single,

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I got into a rut.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.640 align:middle line:90%
I would go to work.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Then I would want to come home
and watch movies with my dog.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.939 align:middle line:84%
And one of my girlfriends said,
Marla, every Wednesday night

00:36:09.939 --> 00:36:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking you out.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:13.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to this
beautiful champagne bar.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.520 align:middle line:84%
They had a beautiful
one up on Rush Street.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And we went out
there every week.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.635 align:middle line:90%
And I did meet a guy.

00:36:18.635 --> 00:36:21.372 align:middle line:84%
I dated him for like five
months, just to get out.

00:36:21.372 --> 00:36:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like
prowling around.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.800 align:middle line:84%
It was like going out for a
lovely drink and socializing.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was great.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are there some
people who just don't need

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:30.980 align:middle line:90%
a relationship?

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.082 align:middle line:90%
Can they get by?

00:36:32.082 --> 00:36:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, yeah.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: On there
own, single forever?

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Humans, we're
social creatures and we want

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:38.900 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.597 align:middle line:84%
But I think if you have great
friends, you have maybe a pet.

00:36:41.597 --> 00:36:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, you and I
are animal people.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my dog, I can get all
the hugs and kisses from my dog

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:46.880 align:middle line:90%
that I need, right?

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have to be
in a romantic relationship

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%
every minute of our lives.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, people always
feel that, like, I

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.760 align:middle line:90%
need to be in a relationship.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it's great to take
a break, even a few years.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I only have
one sad pet story.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.139 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sad pet story.

00:37:01.139 --> 00:37:04.180 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, I had
a little baby turtle.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.080 align:middle line:84%
In those days, they sold
turtles at the stores.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And they don't anymore,
because of salmonella.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what's funny?

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.770 align:middle line:90%
We never got salmonella.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: We never
got it back then.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.073 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, we did all
these horrendous, germy things,

00:37:17.073 --> 00:37:18.410 align:middle line:90%
and never got a disease.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So I bought my little tiny,
it was a slider turtle,

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.050 align:middle line:90%
tiny little green thing.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.149 align:middle line:84%
And I must have been
about eight years old

00:37:25.149 --> 00:37:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and I'm playing with him.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.010 align:middle line:90%
And he bit me.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.674 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they don't have
teeth, but he wouldn't let go.

00:37:31.674 --> 00:37:33.965 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this turtle
on the end of my finger.

00:37:33.965 --> 00:37:35.505 align:middle line:84%
And I'm eight years
old, and I'm screaming.

00:37:35.505 --> 00:37:37.439 align:middle line:84%
It didn't hurt, but it
just didn't look right.

00:37:37.439 --> 00:37:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I didn't
know what to do with him.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.540 align:middle line:90%
So I'm waving my hand, you know?

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.140 align:middle line:90%
And I flung him.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And he, unfortunately,
let go and hit the wall.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.087 align:middle line:90%
And that was it for him.

00:37:49.087 --> 00:37:49.920 align:middle line:90%
That's my sad story.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: I have
a sad turtle story.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.386 align:middle line:84%
When I was four years old, my
little brother was like one.

00:37:54.386 --> 00:37:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had two of those
little slider turtles,

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.218 align:middle line:90%
with the little island.

00:37:57.218 --> 00:37:58.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, with the
little palm tree.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: With a
plastic palm tree.

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And I loved
those little turtles.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And then my brother
was on a walker.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.100 align:middle line:90%
And he would walk around.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.558 align:middle line:84%
He went over to
one of the turtles,

00:38:04.558 --> 00:38:07.165 align:middle line:84%
picked it up and bit
its leg, and it died.

00:38:07.165 --> 00:38:08.300 align:middle line:90%
And my mom, says--

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I used
to breed hamsters.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I was a boy scientist.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I was into chemistry, rocketry,
the bizarre, the paranormal,

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.302 align:middle line:90%
that's what happened to me.

00:38:18.302 --> 00:38:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I decided I wanted
to breed hamsters.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:24.430 align:middle line:90%
So I did it right.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I had it down to the moment
the little tiny hamster

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.210 align:middle line:90%
got pregnant.

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.980 align:middle line:84%
14 days later, she
had her little litter.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:33.810 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:90%
I even built them a cage.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.100 align:middle line:90%
I made one mistake.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how
small the hamsters

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:90%
were when they were born.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I built it
with the screen bigger

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.710 align:middle line:90%
than the hamsters.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:51.870 align:middle line:84%
The mother couldn't get out,
but the little babies could.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And my father,
God rest his soul,

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.510 align:middle line:90%
would always go downstairs.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was where he would
shave and take his shower

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
before he went to work.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And one morning, I
heard him screaming.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Screaming.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
He had smashed baby hamsters
on the bottom of his foot.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh!

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They had crawled out.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why we're talking

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:84%
about this, when we're
talking about dating.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: You are--

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you know,
things like that happen.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.164 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, let's take some
questions for Marla.

00:39:26.164 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: No
more sad stories.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Who's got some more?

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:30.540 align:middle line:84%
We've got a couple
more questions

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.170 align:middle line:90%
that we need from you.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.400 align:middle line:90%
There you go, ma'am.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: How problematic do
you find people's self-esteem

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:40.470 align:middle line:84%
issues to be in matching
them with other people?

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels like they would
have unrealistic expectations

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:50.872 align:middle line:84%
and needs that would hinder
their finding the right person.

00:39:50.872 --> 00:39:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Self-esteem
is a big issue,

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:56.110 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people,
well, especially women,

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%
we tend to look for a guy
to complete us or save us.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:84%
We women value ourselves
based on our relationships.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And men get their
self-esteem from their work,

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.230 align:middle line:90%
from their careers.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:12.550 align:middle line:90%
So it plays a lot into it.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why I always
say, work on yourself.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.767 align:middle line:84%
Do as much introspection and
work on yourself as you can.

00:40:17.767 --> 00:40:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But you want to be a
whole, complete person,

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.800 align:middle line:84%
happy with yourself, before
you partner with somebody else.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Two people who are broken,
not happy with themselves,

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.830 align:middle line:84%
coming together, that's
a recipe for disaster.

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
have a lot of divorce.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you fix a
situation that may have been

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:84%
good, and that fell apart and
then you try to work it out,

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:90%
and does it work?

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.047 align:middle line:90%
Can you fix mistakes?

00:40:43.047 --> 00:40:44.255 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:40:44.255 --> 00:40:47.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all mess
up in relationships.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:90%
We argue.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.110 align:middle line:90%
We have difficulties.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:54.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're both willing to work
on it, and there's counseling,

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.550 align:middle line:84%
there are books, there's
things you can do.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.004 align:middle line:84%
I think it's worth-- unless
you're getting beat up,

00:40:59.004 --> 00:41:00.420 align:middle line:84%
or cheated on, or
somebody, right?

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I think people should put
a little effort into it.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:03.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not just magic.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh I found my soul mate.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going
to be perfect.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.370 align:middle line:90%
We do everything the same.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.800 align:middle line:84%
We cut our peas, you know,
the carrots the same.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.260 align:middle line:90%
We both eat peas one at a time.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.890 align:middle line:90%
We like the same music.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.410 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a dream.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:15.660 align:middle line:90%
I found my soul mate, no.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.360 align:middle line:84%
A soul mate might
be a person who

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.440 align:middle line:84%
has to show you some
parts of yourself

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.960 align:middle line:90%
that you need to work on.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.590 align:middle line:84%
With my husband, I have
needed to work on patience.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.840 align:middle line:90%
There's some things that I--

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, do
you fight with him?

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, he's Latin.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you know.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.620 align:middle line:90%
He gets a little feisty.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You don't?

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Well, no.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:38.142 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, when
we do have a fight,

00:41:38.142 --> 00:41:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and I would say more of like
a squabble, an argument,

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:43.587 align:middle line:84%
a disagreement, what's
really interesting about us.

00:41:43.587 --> 00:41:45.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like 20 minutes later,
it's like it never happened.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.885 align:middle line:90%
We don't dwell on it.

00:41:46.885 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:90%
We don't bring it up later.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You
don't have grudges.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: No, we
don't keep grudges.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.400 align:middle line:90%
We have to kind of hash it out.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.545 align:middle line:84%
And he does have more
of that kind of uppity.

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He's spontaneous.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.919 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: He's passionate.

00:41:56.919 --> 00:41:58.070 align:middle line:90%
He's very kind of fiery.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.420 align:middle line:90%
But then he's very sweet.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.290 align:middle line:90%
So it works out.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.735 align:middle line:90%
And hey, it's not boring.

00:42:02.735 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's take some more questions.

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:06.011 align:middle line:84%
How about from some of
you single folks out there

00:42:06.011 --> 00:42:07.167 align:middle line:90%
in the audience?

00:42:07.167 --> 00:42:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Should
we, at some point,

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.201 align:middle line:84%
lower our expectations
as we get older?

00:42:11.201 --> 00:42:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Oh,
that's a good one.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I see some people clapping
over here, for that one.

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:19.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think, as we
get older we kind of mature

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and realize, people,
we're all going to age.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.310 align:middle line:84%
We'll get a little
gray or lose some hair,

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:25.800 align:middle line:84%
maybe get a little
paunch, or whatever.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.008 align:middle line:90%
And that is not as important.

00:42:27.008 --> 00:42:29.970 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because when
I-- the women in their 20's,

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.480 align:middle line:84%
they still want
a really hot guy.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's all
looks and stuff.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Then in the 30's, they're
easing up a little bit.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.890 align:middle line:84%
They still want a
nice looking guy,

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.973 align:middle line:84%
but it's like, OK, he
doesn't have to-- he can be,

00:42:39.973 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:84%
maybe, a little shorter
than I wanted, or whatever.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Then when they get
their 40's they're like,

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I just want a nice guy with
some hair and his own teeth.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:50.902 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The compromise begins.

00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: The compromise.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It's more about
qualities and character

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.930 align:middle line:84%
than looks, as we get
a little bit older.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:59.669 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And into
your 50's or 60's?

00:42:59.669 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah,
you want companionship,

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.560 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more than when--
it does change than we are

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.240 align:middle line:90%
in our 20's.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's--
what did she call it?

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.357 align:middle line:90%
Compromise?

00:43:08.357 --> 00:43:09.315 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Compromising?

00:43:09.315 --> 00:43:12.211 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Compromising,
or lowering your expectations.

00:43:12.211 --> 00:43:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they might be a
little higher, in some ways.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Because like you
were talking about,

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:18.910 align:middle line:84%
women will go with the
bad boys and be maybe

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.774 align:middle line:84%
verbally abused, or
physically abused.

00:43:20.774 --> 00:43:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we get
older, we're not

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:90%
willing to put up with that.

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So we're not lowering
our expectations.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.680 align:middle line:84%
But we might be compromising
on some other things.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Marla, when a spouse
dies, the other one, sometimes,

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:36.515 align:middle line:84%
goes pretty close,
pretty close to them.

00:43:36.515 --> 00:43:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON:
Especially the men.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is that?

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.269 align:middle line:84%
Can you literally die
of a broken heart?

00:43:41.269 --> 00:43:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Absolutely.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:43.809 align:middle line:84%
Especially, there's
couples that are

00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:90%
married 60 years, 50, 60 years.

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And that is so sad.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some come in
after that has happened.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because women,

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.636 align:middle line:84%
let's say, after a
divorce or a spouse dies,

00:43:54.636 --> 00:43:56.010 align:middle line:84%
women will go work
on themselves.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.009 align:middle line:90%
They'll take a year off.

00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:59.310 align:middle line:84%
They'll go to a yoga retreat,
or read a lot of books.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Men, a lot of times,
they want-- they're

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.190 align:middle line:84%
getting into a
relationship right away.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Because they just
can't be alone.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.280 align:middle line:84%
The men, when a man's been
married or in a relationship,

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.310 align:middle line:84%
they tend to really
like that, and thrive.

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It's said that men, married men,
live longer than single men.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:16.970 align:middle line:84%
However, I think I read that
married women live less.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Really?

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Don't let this--

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.103 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How about one more
question from the audience?

00:44:22.103 --> 00:44:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well, I've
been single my whole life,

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I've never been married.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 57 years old.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:31.610 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:32.361 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Wow!

00:44:32.361 --> 00:44:32.985 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Whoa.

00:44:32.985 --> 00:44:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Whoa!

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I know.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ever come close?

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And why
do you think that is?

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well, I have lots
of reasons why I think it is.

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:49.300 align:middle line:84%
But I've become-- have gotten
to this place in my life

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.160 align:middle line:84%
where I'm pretty
comfortable with the fact.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I also, when people say, why
have you never been married?

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:56.660 align:middle line:84%
My answer is, well,
the great part

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.060 align:middle line:84%
is, I've also never
been divorced.

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So I have no
baggage left behind.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've got pretty
good relationships

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.330 align:middle line:90%
with ex-boyfriends.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:10.890 align:middle line:84%
But it is-- where do, you know
40's, you think 40's are hard.

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:13.425 align:middle line:90%
Be 57 and try to meet someone.

00:45:13.425 --> 00:45:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, it
sounds like you've had a lot

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.550 align:middle line:90%
of boyfriends and relationships.

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.105 align:middle line:90%
What is it about you?

00:45:19.105 --> 00:45:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Would you think it maybe was
your career, your personality,

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:25.330 align:middle line:84%
or something, that was really
keeping that from happening?

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:27.750 align:middle line:90%
And did you want it to happen?

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well, as I've
done my own introspection,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I think one reason has been,
I never wanted children.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I was clear on that
from my whole life.

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I was just not maternal.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:44.992 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think I was really
looking for a potential father,

00:45:44.992 --> 00:45:47.200 align:middle line:84%
which usually comes when
you're looking for husbands.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.905 align:middle line:84%
And I tended to date a lot
of long haired musicians.

00:45:52.905 --> 00:45:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That explains it.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.154 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: They were hot.

00:45:55.154 --> 00:45:56.032 align:middle line:90%
And uh--

00:45:56.032 --> 00:45:57.654 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: The
bad boys, right?

00:45:57.654 --> 00:45:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Aw,
they weren't bad.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.403 align:middle line:90%
They were really good musicians.

00:46:00.403 --> 00:46:02.911 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And then as I-- I also, I have
a very big personality, myself.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very outgoing
and laugh really loud.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.700 align:middle line:90%


00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.534 align:middle line:84%
I was giggling, but you
know, I could have--

00:46:15.534 --> 00:46:16.866 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: You toned it down?

00:46:16.866 --> 00:46:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I toned it down.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.432 align:middle line:84%
So that can-- I think I've
intimidated a lot of men.

00:46:22.432 --> 00:46:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: OK.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.723 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And
that's the hard part.

00:46:24.723 --> 00:46:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to find a man who
was so comfortable in himself

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.117 align:middle line:90%
that he's proud of that.

00:46:29.117 --> 00:46:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that woman over there
laughing really big and loud

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and really funny
is, she's with me.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I'll tell
you what we're going to do.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.071 align:middle line:90%
We're going to take this break.

00:46:36.071 --> 00:46:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But I want Marla to do
a love reading on you

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.630 align:middle line:84%
when we come back
on "Beyond Belief."

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:42.672 align:middle line:90%
Don't go away.

00:46:42.672 --> 00:46:46.656 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:46.656 --> 00:46:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome back to
"Beyond Belief" with Marla,

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Martenson.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And , of course, we grabbed
Robin from the audience

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.785 align:middle line:90%
to bring her up.

00:46:53.785 --> 00:46:55.980 align:middle line:90%
She's 57 years old.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.554 align:middle line:90%
Has never been married.

00:46:58.554 --> 00:46:59.470 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:01.029 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I know it.

00:47:01.029 --> 00:47:01.570 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So what do you do?

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, do
you want to get married?

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Good question.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Uh, yes and no.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm very-- I've gotten
very comfortable

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.810 align:middle line:84%
in living my own life,
living in my own space.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:18.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm very independent.

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:20.790 align:middle line:84%
But now, as I'm
getting older, I'd

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.090 align:middle line:84%
like to get married
for different reasons

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.650 align:middle line:84%
than when I used to wish
for when I was young.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.460 align:middle line:90%
I would like companionship.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I would like, it
would be easier for me

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.310 align:middle line:90%
to retire if I had a partner.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly want to
travel a lot when I retire.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And that would also be a lot
easier with a life partner.

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: It would be fun to
have somebody to do that with,

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:40.450 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Now when you were younger,
you didn't want kids.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.925 align:middle line:84%
So what were your reasons for
wanting to get married then?

00:47:44.925 --> 00:47:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I think it was just
the whole romantic notion that

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:48.490 align:middle line:90%
we, as girls, want.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted the honeymoon.

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: The white dress.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I
wanted the wedding.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.420 align:middle line:90%
I wanted the reception.

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, I just sort of
visualized the whole thing.

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:00.052 align:middle line:84%
And as I watched
girlfriend after girlfriend

00:48:00.052 --> 00:48:01.260 align:middle line:90%
after girlfriend get married.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.468 align:middle line:84%
And I'm bridesmaid after
bridesmaid after bridesmaid,

00:48:03.468 --> 00:48:04.470 align:middle line:90%
it's like ooh.

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Ooh, did you
ever catch the bouquet?

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.115 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Probably.

00:48:08.115 --> 00:48:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: So are
you dating much now?

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I date, yeah.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.585 align:middle line:84%
And I've definitely
lowered my expectations.

00:48:16.585 --> 00:48:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: So now-- you
said you used to date the rock

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and roll, the
musicians, and stuff.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.693 align:middle line:90%
Are you still keeping with that?

00:48:21.693 --> 00:48:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Are you still-- I mean,
you seem like, 57,

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.670 align:middle line:84%
you're really like
cute and fashionable.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.827 align:middle line:84%
And you just don't-- you're
just young, young spirit.

00:48:30.827 --> 00:48:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Rock and roll
is still my greatest passion.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, it is?

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.743 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I live and breathe
for rock and roll music.

00:48:35.743 --> 00:48:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
for me to meet

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.180 align:middle line:90%
someone who also loves music.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.430 align:middle line:90%
I go dancing a lot.

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I go out to hear
live music a lot.

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
important part for me.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.697 align:middle line:84%
But now it's more important
for me that they have a job.

00:48:50.697 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And
have you found that,

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.530 align:middle line:84%
even in the 40's and 50's that
guys with no jobs, that you--

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.560 align:middle line:84%
are you one of those women
that kind of may be attracted

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.674 align:middle line:84%
to guys, where you're
going to fix them?

00:49:00.674 --> 00:49:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:03.760 align:middle line:90%
I've dated lots of projects.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.205 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Lots of projects.

00:49:04.205 --> 00:49:04.704 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:04.704 --> 00:49:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Would
you support a guy?

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Uh, I have.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:08.536 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to do that.

00:49:08.536 --> 00:49:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You have?

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Interesting.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like, they
didn't work, and you did?

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:14.855 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I had one man
live with me for a year,

00:49:14.855 --> 00:49:16.072 align:middle line:90%
who did not work.

00:49:16.072 --> 00:49:16.655 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:49:16.655 --> 00:49:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Why did you do that?

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.659 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Uh, I was in love.

00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:22.575 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: In love.

00:49:22.575 --> 00:49:23.699 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I was in love.

00:49:23.699 --> 00:49:27.616 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I
wouldn't do it again.

00:49:27.616 --> 00:49:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Every relationship you've
got to learn something

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.375 align:middle line:90%
that you don't want to repeat.

00:49:31.375 --> 00:49:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are there a lot of
guys out there that do that?

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.889 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for women
to prey on, basically?

00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well,
it's interesting.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
experienced this,

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.113 align:middle line:90%
or if you've used online dating.

00:49:40.113 --> 00:49:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of women will say, I'm
getting hit on by young guys,

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.060 align:middle line:84%
like in their 20's, and
I'm in my 40's or 50's.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder, are they just
looking for a sugar mama?

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Or what's their
reasoning on that.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.370 align:middle line:90%
Have you experienced that?

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Well, I have.

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:55.546 align:middle line:84%
Because I have
done online dating.

00:49:55.546 --> 00:49:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And the last time I did it, I
made sure I wrote in my bio,

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.010 align:middle line:90%
I date age appropriately.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:02.110 align:middle line:90%
I am not a cougar.

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Right.

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: While the of
thought of hooking up with

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:11.640 align:middle line:84%
a young, hot male body
is attractive, it's not--

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.737 align:middle line:90%
what do you talk about?

00:50:12.737 --> 00:50:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Right.

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:15.903 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I want to meet
someone who I can talk about

00:50:15.903 --> 00:50:18.070 align:middle line:90%
the TV shows I grew up watching.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And that, do you remember seeing
the Beatles on Ed Sullivan?

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Because I do.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well, I think
you're getting out there,

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.100 align:middle line:84%
dancing, the meetup.coms, I
think, are going to be great,

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.020 align:middle line:84%
too, because you're going to
find people who love to do what

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:32.770 align:middle line:90%
you do.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And just, you probably have
a great network of friends.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I do.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the
hardest part has

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:42.340 align:middle line:84%
been that not everyone-- my
big personality might attract.

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But it can be a real
deterrent to a lot of men.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.915 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm gaining more
focus than they are.

00:50:49.915 --> 00:50:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Mm, hm.

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:52.415 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I mean,
you must be lucky,

00:50:52.415 --> 00:50:54.400 align:middle line:84%
because you've got
this huge career,

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.633 align:middle line:84%
but you also have a
husband who is a musician.

00:50:56.633 --> 00:50:57.439 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:50:57.439 --> 00:50:59.355 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Don't point
at me when you say that.

00:50:59.355 --> 00:51:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well,
you brought it up.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I'm not the husband.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, all right.

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: No, but
you brought it up,

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:06.005 align:middle line:84%
that she has a husband who is
a really good piano player.

00:51:06.005 --> 00:51:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So he must have
his own fan base.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: He has
his own fan base.

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we both want to
kind of be in the spotlight.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I write books, and I'm
out there and I'm on shows.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.148 align:middle line:90%
And then he's doing his show.

00:51:14.148 --> 00:51:16.222 align:middle line:84%
So we both kind
of are out there.

00:51:16.222 --> 00:51:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And that kind of balance is--

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, that's kind of
attractive to a relationship.

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.446 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: That is.

00:51:19.446 --> 00:51:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, he's
not intimidated

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.920 align:middle line:90%
that I'm out there doing things.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not jealous.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.000 align:middle line:84%
People will say,
oh, do women try

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000 align:middle line:84%
hit on your husband at
the piano bar, and stuff?

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's so cute, because
he loves telling a women,

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm happily married.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:34.345 align:middle line:84%
But here's my wife's
card, she's a matchmaker.

00:51:34.345 --> 00:51:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: So
that's kind of cute.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, see I need
to meet somebody who's really,

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:38.910 align:middle line:90%
really comfortable.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:40.743 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Who is
secure and comfortable.

00:51:40.743 --> 00:51:42.887 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And
thrilled to be with me.

00:51:42.887 --> 00:51:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Right.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Because I
can't tone down who I am.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: You can't change.

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.280 align:middle line:90%
You can't change for somebody.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: People don't change.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON:
People don't change.

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This has been
you all your life, right?

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:50.581 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:50.581 --> 00:51:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Maybe
on a first date,

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.280 align:middle line:84%
you want to let them talk
a little more, though,

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.030 align:middle line:90%
just tone it down.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:57.070 align:middle line:84%
You can still be funny,
but let them really

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.750 align:middle line:90%
kind of take the spotlight.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And ask them more
questions, than you talk.

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:04.010 align:middle line:90%
And then that might help.

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:06.364 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I do try to
be really good listener.

00:52:06.364 --> 00:52:07.300 align:middle line:90%
So I do try.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: A lot of feedback
I get on dates, George,

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:12.880 align:middle line:84%
after dates they'll say, all the
other person did was talk about

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.750 align:middle line:90%
themself.

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And both men and women
will tell me that.

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:17.255 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, well, who is it?

00:52:17.255 --> 00:52:19.380 align:middle line:84%
You know if you're both
all talking about yourself.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.830 align:middle line:90%
But people do need to listen.

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And it could be from nerves,
where you're going on and on.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Or going on and on about
the ex or your problems.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.539 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not
something that's good.

00:52:29.539 --> 00:52:31.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not a therapy
session, it's just

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.450 align:middle line:84%
a date to see if you want
get to a second date.

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now where would
someone like Robin go to want

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.160 align:middle line:90%
to meet people?

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Would she sign up with someone
like you, as, not as a client,

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:43.490 align:middle line:90%
but as--

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: To
be in the database?

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:45.173 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

00:52:45.173 --> 00:52:46.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
a gorgeous woman.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:84%
You sign up with a
matchmaking service.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Get online, like you said
you have tried online.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.330 align:middle line:90%
You go out dancing.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:55.714 align:middle line:90%
Get on meetup.com.

00:52:55.714 --> 00:52:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And just keep living your life.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
attract the right person,

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.620 align:middle line:84%
because now you're kind of more
in line and in tune with what

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:04.100 align:middle line:90%
you do want and you don't want.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.099 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be
attracting these projects

00:53:06.099 --> 00:53:06.959 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:53:06.959 --> 00:53:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Right.

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But now what do you think
about the term deal-breaker?

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Because I've got a bunch.

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:13.560 align:middle line:90%
But I'm--

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Maybe
you have too many.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Maybe
too many, yes.

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well,
that's my concern.

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:18.766 align:middle line:84%
Should I put them out
there and let them know,

00:53:18.766 --> 00:53:20.332 align:middle line:90%
these are my deal-breakers.

00:53:20.332 --> 00:53:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: You'll
find that out.

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not right away.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.808 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: No, you'll
find it out in conversation.

00:53:24.808 --> 00:53:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're online,
they'll be in their bios.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.383 align:middle line:84%
Because you, let's
say, a deal-breaker

00:53:28.383 --> 00:53:30.060 align:middle line:90%
maybe is no smokers.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Right, no smoking.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Don't pick
your nose at dinner.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well, you know,
but should you put that

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:38.060 align:middle line:90%
in your bio?

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Because my theory is, I
put it out there and say,

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.680 align:middle line:84%
these are the things that
are really important to me,

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.790 align:middle line:84%
so I don't waste my
time or their time.

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yes.

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Put it in your bio.

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Go on dates, so--

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, give
us some more examples.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, what
are some of your other

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:50.350 align:middle line:90%
deal-breakers?

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:53.375 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well,
like, for my politics.

00:53:53.375 --> 00:53:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What, you mean,
you wouldn't date a guy--

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.060 align:middle line:90%
let's assume, you're a Democrat.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:57.768 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Ugh!

00:53:57.768 --> 00:53:58.449 align:middle line:90%
My God!

00:53:58.449 --> 00:53:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How did I guess that?

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.101 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: In Boulder, what?

00:54:01.101 --> 00:54:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You wouldn't
date a guy because he was

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.710 align:middle line:90%
conservative?

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It would be hard.

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:07.136 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're kidding me?

00:54:07.136 --> 00:54:08.764 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No.

00:54:08.764 --> 00:54:09.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to argue.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's why you're
not married and you're 57.

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:12.717 align:middle line:90%
So why?

00:54:12.717 --> 00:54:13.758 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Here we go.

00:54:13.758 --> 00:54:14.614 align:middle line:90%
Problem solved.

00:54:14.614 --> 00:54:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: What, are all
older men conservative?

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, not necessarily.

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But why do you have to
date a guy or a woman who

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.640 align:middle line:84%
has your same
political persuasion?

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.280 align:middle line:90%
You must like talking about it.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I do.

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:26.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So that
is a deal-breaker.

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: That's
a deal-breaker.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:28.771 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It is, yeah.

00:54:28.771 --> 00:54:31.379 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: So no smoking,
political, what else?

00:54:31.379 --> 00:54:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What if
he's a libertarian?

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Does that work?

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, they're
crazier than Republicans.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, God.

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.695 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, no!

00:54:39.695 --> 00:54:41.528 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, nodbody
knows my last name.

00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:42.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.470 align:middle line:84%
No, politics is,
it's, well, you know,

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.505 align:middle line:90%
my politics reflects my values.

00:54:47.505 --> 00:54:49.076 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
amazing, though,

00:54:49.076 --> 00:54:51.580 align:middle line:84%
that you would dump a guy
because he didn't have

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:52.080 align:middle line:90%
the same--

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: No, I
wouldn't dump him.

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:54.570 align:middle line:90%
I just wouldn't go out.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: You wouldn't
even give him a chance.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well what
if he tricked you?

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.213 align:middle line:84%
What if he said
he was a Democrat?

00:55:00.213 --> 00:55:01.774 align:middle line:84%
A lot of politicians
will trick you.

00:55:01.774 --> 00:55:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And
then you fell in love.

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.981 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And
then I fell in love?

00:55:04.981 --> 00:55:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
that, I don't know.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.660 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Let's try that.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.138 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Mary,
what's her name?

00:55:11.138 --> 00:55:12.475 align:middle line:90%
Mary Matalin and James Carville.

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:13.240 align:middle line:90%
How do they do it?

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Maria
Shriver and Schwarzenegger.

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:15.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's a deal-breaker.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.760 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.290 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well, I've learned
that I don't want to date a pot

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.080 align:middle line:90%
smoker.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.931 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
that is justified.

00:55:23.931 --> 00:55:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Now is that a
challenge here in Boulder?

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.013 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Don't believe,
by the way, though,

00:55:28.013 --> 00:55:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I am a supporter in the
medicinal use of marijuana.

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, and
so am I. You know,

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.855 align:middle line:84%
we just legalized it in
Colorado, and I, of course,

00:55:33.855 --> 00:55:34.410 align:middle line:90%
voted for it.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: But I've
dated some pot smokers.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I
think you have a right.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And you know,
you can't get them up off

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.280 align:middle line:90%
the couch.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.240 align:middle line:90%
They're lacking in ambition.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:45.944 align:middle line:84%
They're-- the honey-do list just
keeps getting longer, you know.

00:55:45.944 --> 00:55:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You have a right to
make that call for yourself.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Right.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So I think
that's justified.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yes.

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.527 align:middle line:90%
So that one is for me.

00:55:52.527 --> 00:55:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.170 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: What else?

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: See, you
don't have that many.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.640 align:middle line:84%
What happened to this litany of
a list that you said you had?

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well, OK,
on the physical part.

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.634 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: OK.

00:56:01.634 --> 00:56:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I said, my
expectations have gone down,

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.390 align:middle line:84%
because as I'm looking
for age appropriate men,

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and men in their late 50's early
60's are likely to be carrying

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.220 align:middle line:90%
a few extra pounds.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I can deal with a
few extra pounds.

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:17.330 align:middle line:90%
I could not deal with a gut.

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't deal with--
I could deal with bald.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.360 align:middle line:90%
I can deal-- I love silver hair.

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:26.182 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's
but glasses, or--

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Doesn't matter.

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:29.885 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm not as-- I'm
not looking for a Brad Pitt

00:56:29.885 --> 00:56:30.730 align:middle line:90%
or George Clooney.

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:33.030 align:middle line:84%
It, quite honestly, if
I were dating somebody

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:34.892 align:middle line:84%
that good looking,
I'd be nervous

00:56:34.892 --> 00:56:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that other women would be
constantly hitting on them.

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah .

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And, here's the
weird one, I like short men.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.389 align:middle line:84%
So if other women are all
wanting the tall ones,

00:56:44.389 --> 00:56:45.430 align:middle line:90%
I'll take the short ones.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: That's right.

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:47.437 align:middle line:84%
The average American
male is 5, 9.

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:49.145 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
great guys 5, 8-- 5,

00:56:49.145 --> 00:56:51.944 align:middle line:84%
7 that get past up, because
women, oh, I only date 6 feet

00:56:51.944 --> 00:56:52.444 align:middle line:90%
and up.

00:56:52.444 --> 00:56:53.569 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How tall are you?

00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm 5.5 and 1/2.

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:57.786 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And in high
heels, you're about 6, 2.

00:56:57.786 --> 00:57:01.464 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: God, I can't
wear high heels anymore.

00:57:01.464 --> 00:57:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So most of those
aren't real deal-breakers.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: No, those are--

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.003 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The politics
one is strange.

00:57:06.003 --> 00:57:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Really?

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.257 align:middle line:90%
You think it's really strange?

00:57:08.257 --> 00:57:10.715 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you-- has your
husband got the same political

00:57:10.715 --> 00:57:10.850 align:middle line:90%
persuasion.

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: We have the same.

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.055 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of in the
middle, you know.

00:57:14.055 --> 00:57:16.150 align:middle line:84%
We're just, we're
not really either.

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:19.330 align:middle line:84%
We vote for the candidate,
not for the party.

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:20.429 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:57:20.429 --> 00:57:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And we don't talk about
politics that much.

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.886 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Show of
hands in the audience.

00:57:23.886 --> 00:57:26.470 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
would marry someone

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:29.620 align:middle line:84%
who had a different
political persuasion as you?

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.205 align:middle line:90%


00:57:32.205 --> 00:57:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Less than half.

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Quite a few.

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:34.952 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Less than half.

00:57:34.952 --> 00:57:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you're
not all that off.

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:38.125 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah, it
never crossed my mind.

00:57:38.125 --> 00:57:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It wouldn't both me.

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.345 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: It
never crossed my mind.

00:57:40.345 --> 00:57:43.040 align:middle line:84%
As long as they're not radical,
in talking about it, and angry

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.780 align:middle line:90%
and debating people.

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.049 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't like that.

00:57:46.049 --> 00:57:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Right.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.340 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I've just got
a lot of passion about it.

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I think it
reflects a lot of my values.

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.621 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm very strong
for women's rights.

00:57:55.621 --> 00:57:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There's
nothing wrong with that.

00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Yeah.

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.452 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think you sound
like a great catch.

00:58:00.452 --> 00:58:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Ooh!

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.326 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was going to
say, would she be difficult

00:58:03.326 --> 00:58:03.930 align:middle line:90%
to place?

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: No.

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I think she would be a lot of
fun to work with, actually.

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:06.699 align:middle line:90%
So will she--

00:58:06.699 --> 00:58:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You do have
a strong personality.

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And I bet that intimidates guys.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That's been
an issue over the years.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So and I've tried-- you
know, my new word is soften.

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:27.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm really, constantly
trying to soften my opinions,

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:31.300 align:middle line:84%
increase my tolerance level and
be a little more compromising.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to work.

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:33.816 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Bring
out your femininity.

00:58:33.816 --> 00:58:36.359 align:middle line:84%
Even though you're feminine,
but your femininity in power.

00:58:36.359 --> 00:58:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Right, yeah.

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But it's not easy.

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:41.067 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It's still not
easy, because you know--

00:58:41.067 --> 00:58:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's hear it for Robin.

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:43.576 align:middle line:90%
Robin, thank you.

00:58:43.576 --> 00:58:45.158 align:middle line:84%
You can go back to
your chair dear.

00:58:45.158 --> 00:58:46.116 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:58:46.116 --> 00:58:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Thank you.

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good luck.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Good luck.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good luck.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It must be pretty difficult
sometimes to place people,

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.622 align:middle line:84%
yet it's got to be very
satisfying when you do.

00:58:57.622 --> 00:58:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, yeah.

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.800 align:middle line:84%
That's like I'll do a happy
dance around the room when,

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:01.620 align:middle line:90%
you know, somebody calls.

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.078 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we both liked
each other a lot.

00:59:03.078 --> 00:59:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Or we're in an exclusive
relationship, or engaged.

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.000 align:middle line:90%
It's like, yay!

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I celebrate.

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What
has been, for you,

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:14.120 align:middle line:84%
the most bizarre moment
in your business?

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: Oh, boy.

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:16.391 align:middle line:90%
Gosh.

00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:17.223 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's so--

00:59:17.223 --> 00:59:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The craziest
thing that ever happened,

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that ever came back to
you, in terms of feedback.

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.006 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Oh,
well, all right,

00:59:23.006 --> 00:59:25.757 align:middle line:84%
I think I can say
this on camera.

00:59:25.757 --> 00:59:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I think you can.

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.548 align:middle line:90%
>> MARTENSON: OK.

00:59:27.548 --> 00:59:30.244 align:middle line:84%
So I had-- the couple I matched
up, they were so cute together.

00:59:30.244 --> 00:59:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I thought they were
probably going to get married.

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.465 align:middle line:84%
They were adorable,
they seemed so happy.

00:59:34.465 --> 00:59:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The guy calls me up one
day and he says, uh, Marla,

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.339 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to see,
let's call her Rebecca.

00:59:40.339 --> 00:59:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
see Rebecca anymore.

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.425 align:middle line:84%
And I think I've got
to break up with her.

00:59:43.425 --> 00:59:43.924 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:59:43.924 --> 00:59:45.520 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.266 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I just, I-- I don't
know if I can say this.

00:59:48.266 --> 00:59:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like,
well, just tell me.

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, her
areolas are too big.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No?

00:59:56.010 --> 00:59:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: And
I said, excuse me?

00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:00.115 align:middle line:84%
And he says, yeah, I
just can't, you know,

01:00:00.115 --> 01:00:01.740 align:middle line:84%
handle it when she
takes off her shirt.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Her body
parts were too big.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Well,
for his taste.

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I thought you
were going to say, well,

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:08.206 align:middle line:90%
I won't even go there.

01:00:08.206 --> 01:00:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: Anyway, so
I mean, I was like, what?

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.270 align:middle line:90%
So he broke up with her.

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:14.307 align:middle line:90%
And that was--

01:00:14.307 --> 01:00:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Well this is Marla Martenson.

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MARTENSON: That
was beyond belief.

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.873 align:middle line:90%
It was beyond belief, all right?

01:00:18.873 --> 01:00:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Thanks, Marla.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:22.570 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe some of Marla's
tips have helped you out,

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
in terms of building
your own relationship.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, the divorce rate
is hovering around 50%.

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So you know what the odds are
when you're out there trying

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.460 align:middle line:84%
to find that very
special person.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:40.460 align:middle line:90%
This is "Beyond Belief."

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, I'll
see you next time.

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:43.692 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:00:43.692 --> 01:00:45.656 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:45.656 --> 01:01:04.767 align:middle line:90%
