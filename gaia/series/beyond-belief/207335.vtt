00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Now, what
exactly is an intuitive healer?

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.635 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIDGET NIELSEN: Tuning into
auras, tuning into energy,

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and then being able to heal
those particular disturbances.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have
experiences with the ETs

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:10%
as well, don't you?

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I started having a
lot of different encounters,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
at first with angels and
other kinds of beings,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:84%
but then it went to
extraterrestrials.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were
to give a blood test,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:90%
would it be all human?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: We are
not fully just human.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
We do have
extraterrestrial genetics

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:90%
that we've been mixed with.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
totally convinced

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.982 align:middle line:84%
that you aren't
imagining these things?

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:45.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, I'm
totally convinced.

00:00:50.253 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Welcome to "Beyond
Belief," with Bridget Nielsen,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:10%
our special guest, an intuitive
healer and personal development

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:10%
mentor who
specializes in uniting

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:10%
our metaphysical reality
with modern life.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.652 align:middle line:90%
Bridget, welcome to the program.

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Thank you so much.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me, George.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in intuitive healing?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.103 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:09.937 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Oh, gosh.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:10%
I mean, through all the
years of my life, even,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:10%
especially when I was a kid,
I felt this extra sensitivity,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:10%
definitely more empathic
than most kids around me.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NIELSEN: And so I felt
this intuitive nature.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:10%
And so I started
getting into how

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:10%
I could utilize that to help
people and understand it more.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it genetic?

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.393 align:middle line:84%
Did you get this from your
mother or your grandmother?

00:01:30.393 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Definitely.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:90%
I got some from--

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.022 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew it.

00:01:33.022 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: You knew it.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I got a lot from my
grandmother and from my mom,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.695 align:middle line:84%
but also from my dad's side that
has some Native American in it

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:40.495 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So there was a nice combination
that came through for me.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what exactly
is an intuitive healer?

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Someone
that uses particularly

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:84%
their extrasensitive perceptions
to connect with something

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical senses,
so tuning into auras,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
tuning into energy, and then
being able to clear or heal

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
those particular
disturbances to then make

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
everything else in the
sensory world more balanced.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you what they
would call a starseed?

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.847 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Definitely.

00:02:09.847 --> 00:02:10.678 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:02:10.678 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: You caught me.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I did.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, what's your
interpretation of a starseed?

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: A starseed
to me is-- also

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.250 align:middle line:84%
termed a wanderer-- is a human
that has soul connections,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:84%
so what could be
called past lives,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:84%
but parallel lives
in future realities

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:90%
as a higher-dimensional being.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So this could be an
extraterrestrial,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
a collective
consciousness, so that you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
have an incarnation as one of
these higher-density beings.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.057 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're a
starseed from your birth?

00:02:40.057 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: You're a starseed
from your birth, yes.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:90%
It can be genetic.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But it also can be these other
lives that are coming through

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that you remember
something more and then

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
bring that through to
your mission on Earth.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What traits pop up
for you to be able to say,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:90%
that person's a starseed?

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: One's sensitivity.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's a huge one,
these extrasensory abilities.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's a big need
and desire in the people

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:84%
that I see that are
starseeds to help and assist

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Earth and consciousness,
particularly

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.060 align:middle line:84%
at this time, so this
bigger heart or yearning

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
of service that's beyond just
the conditioning of being

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:90%
a normal human.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We may need 10
million starseeds on the planet

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:90%
right about now, right?

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.512 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, we do have
at least that many, yes.

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
emotional people?

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Are you?

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, I would say
that they're more emotional.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
They might be shut
down in their emotions,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:90%
because they're so sensitive.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Are you empathic?

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.233 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So they
are more sensitive.

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, very empathic, telepathic.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
They have those
abilities to connect just

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
beyond language
and what is spoken,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
but to something more
between two people,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.148 align:middle line:84%
or in nature, or
with the cosmos.

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So in your
opinion, Bridget,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
is being a starseed a
blessing, or is it a curse?

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It's
definitely a blessing.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But it can be
challenging, because--

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing, because
you know that you're here

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:90%
to be of service.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
There's more clarity
around your mission.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But the challenge is
that it's uncomfortable,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
because this is a lower density
than the most starseed energies

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:90%
and souls are used to.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So it feels very foreign,
alien, uncomfortable,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.495 align:middle line:90%
like that black sheep energy.

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you teach
someone to become a starseed?

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It's not
something that can be taught.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
you're born with and can--

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got
it or you don't.

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah because
it's a soul evolution,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
is really what it's
at, and keying in

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and opening to that
energy that you already

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:90%
have innately within yourself.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And can
you fully function?

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you
have a relationship?

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Can you be normal?

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: That's
a good question.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you definitely be normal.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
You might be-- well, normal
not in a condition sense.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't fully feel
alive in yourself.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:84%
You can't be a muggle,
as they would say,

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:90%
or mainstream person.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
You are going to
have something that's

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:90%
unique and different to you.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.775 align:middle line:84%
But you can integrate
with the world.

00:05:04.775 --> 00:05:05.575 align:middle line:90%
That's possible.

00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The very
well-known Deborah King

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:90%
talked about being a starseed.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if it matches up
with what you just said.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBORAH KING: A
starseed is not here

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:84%
so much to learn as they
are to be of service.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to ask yourself
if you feel like you're

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:90%
really here to serve.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you know lot of
people are here to learn,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
but maybe you're here to serve,
to be of service, because most

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
of the starseeds I've
met, and myself included,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
we're here to help move
the people around us up

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
to the next level of
their consciousness,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.750 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
needing to move up.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are even working
with the Galactic Council.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:90%
I'll get to that in a second.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
But a seed-- just
think about it.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:84%
A seed is something
that's growing.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
may very well be.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:90%
You may be emerging.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.420 align:middle line:90%
You may be emerging.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You agree
with her, Bridge?

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I loved what she
was sharing, yes.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, she talked about,
briefly, a Galactic Federation.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is that?

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.930 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Galactic
Federation is

00:06:15.305 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:84%
comprised of many different
extraterrestrial races that

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
are in common unity for the
common good of the general area

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:90%
in which we live in the cosmos.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does a person
know if they're a starseed?

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
How does a parent know that
their child is a starseed?

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: A parent can
see, because there's

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:90%
something unique.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:90%
There's something different.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:84%
They can have certain
experiences, certain dreams

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
with their eyes open,
maybe see certain beings

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:84%
or certain energies
that, when they're young,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:90%
they'll communicate, right?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And then a normal
person can feel

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:84%
that they're a starseed if
they feel, for me, and tuning

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:84%
into other people
that have this,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that they feel something
very strong when

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.530 align:middle line:84%
they look at the stars and
when they tune into the cosmos.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:84%
There's this knowing
of their origin,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
being from something more, and
that they're here for something

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are starseeds
more often women or men?

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Does it matter?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.393 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Doesn't matter.

00:07:11.393 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:90%
All equal there, yep.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how can
you nurture and awaken

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:90%
the starseed ability?

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Mm.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, as she was
just saying, it's

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
really important to
realize that the term

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.870 align:middle line:84%
"starseed" is a key piece to
this, because it's a seed.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And the seed needs nurturing.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't always germinate.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So many people
could be a starseed,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
but never even awaken
it in this life.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's really beginning
to tune into if that's

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:84%
something that
resonates with you

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and then nurture your
uniqueness and start

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
to connect into more of your
purpose of why you're here.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is a
starseed 100% human,

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.922 align:middle line:84%
or is there a little
extraterrestrial in there?

00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I would say
there's usually a little

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial in there--

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I thought.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: --which most
humans generally have.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So there is a little bit of
extraterrestrial in there,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and then, again,
that soul connection

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
in other lifetimes
to the cosmos.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they get emotional?

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, they can
be emotional at times.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What triggers that?

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: I would say they're--

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
when other humans
are disconnected

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.757 align:middle line:84%
from being kind to each other,
being kind to the planet--

00:08:22.757 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tears them
apart, doesn't it?

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, when it's
like, this is confusing.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Why are we doing this?

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Why are we having wars?

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Why are we destroying
the planet?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we kind
to each other?

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's those
confusions of why humans

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
are destructive
or aren't healthy,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
because starseeds are more
collective, more unified

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:90%
in harmony than in separation.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been out
to a restaurant or some venue,

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and you see a couple fighting,
and does it drive you nuts?

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It does-- in
the sense that I feel it.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel very much so what
they're experiencing.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But for me, one of the
things that's helped,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
being a starseed, is
to understand why.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Like, what are the core origins?

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:84%
What are the core
challenges, was

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:84%
why I got into healing
work, so that I

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:84%
could understand why humans
were doing what they were doing.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I understood
that, it wasn't as intense

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
or charged for me to experience
people being in anger

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:90%
or separation with each other.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And healing
is not just health.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:84%
It could also be emotional
healing, correct?

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Emotional healing,
deep different kinds

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
of trauma or mental blocks
in the mental body as well.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.915 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
different areas of healing.

00:09:31.915 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
particular case,

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:84%
as you said, that this started
when you were very young,

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
did you know that you had
these different abilities?

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Or did your mother
have to tell you?

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.615 align:middle line:84%
How did you know that there
was something very different

00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:45.415 align:middle line:90%
about you?

00:09:45.415 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Mm.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:90%
I would go to sleep at night.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:90%
And I would pray to the stars.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And I would feel this
communion with them.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.222 align:middle line:84%
And it would just run
through my whole body.

00:09:56.222 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So I felt something
unique, that was different,

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't taught in
any way to experience.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I also could
feel, again, deeply,

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:90%
other people and other kids.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't understand.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So my parents didn't quite know
what was happening with me.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But I did feel that
there was something

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that was different from
me than other kids.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought
I was a black sheep.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what
point did you realize

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:90%
you weren't that black sheep?

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Once I was introduced
to different levels of healing

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
work and different
levels of consciousness,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.320 align:middle line:84%
then I realized that
this is why I'm here.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
It was like taking
the college test

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.350 align:middle line:84%
that I was meant for,
that I could pass,

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
because it was so innate
and natural to me.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
that was learned.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And so once I got
into the healing work

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and met other people like that,
it was very, very helpful.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So at this young
age, you're realizing,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.412 align:middle line:84%
there's something
different about me.

00:10:50.412 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:90%
I understand people better.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little more emotional,
and I hear people better.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But you have experiences
with ETs as well, don't you?

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: I do.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.872 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: That happened once
I started doing my healing work

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and opening up to that
which was beyond the senses.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I started realizing
there was so much more.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And once I started letting go
of programs and conditioning,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I started having a lot
of different encounters,

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
at first with angels and
other kinds of beings,

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
but then it went to
extraterrestrials

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and had some pretty
powerful experiences.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.618 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these
direct contact?

00:11:23.618 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, direct contact.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you would see them?

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.713 align:middle line:90%
They would see you?

00:11:26.713 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes,
yes, some of them.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they look like?

00:11:29.505 --> 00:11:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: In one instance,
they were light beings.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:90%
They were very, very tall.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like orbs?

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: No, actual
tall light beings.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.523 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But glowy?

00:11:39.523 --> 00:11:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: But glowing, yes.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.295 align:middle line:84%
Glowing, tall light beings that
weren't fully physicalized.

00:11:44.295 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But when you opened your
eyes, you could see that--

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like angelic?

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
But it was very clear that
they were extraterrestrial,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
because I was, at
that time, working

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:90%
with those kinds of energies.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, in other cases,
they have been different kinds

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:84%
of physicalized beings,
such as mantis beings

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:84%
or other extraterrestrial
races that people would know.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where would you be
when you would see these ETs?

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Oftentimes, they
were always in the bedroom,

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:84%
because they're always
connected, in a sense,

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
to that in between
time and altered

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.025 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness, whether
it's meditation or dreaming.

00:12:17.025 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or right
before bedtime.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah,
right before bedtime.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always dark?

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.908 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Or in the
middle of the night.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lights are out?

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Lights are
out most of the time.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, lights are out.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
they enter your room?

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:90%
They just appear?

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes,
appear in the room.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
question yourself?

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I did
question myself.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the beginning?

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I did
question myself,

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:84%
especially when it
became that real.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.870 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it's
such a visceral experience

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
that it was one of those things
that wasn't questionable,

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had already
had a background

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
in healing and working
with different kinds

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:90%
of nonphysical beings.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.318 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So I had
a little bit of a lay

00:12:51.318 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
of the nonphysical
land to help me.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
they wanted with you?

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.358 align:middle line:90%
Or what do they want with you?

00:12:57.358 --> 00:12:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: A lot of
different things.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in most of the cases,
they were there to assist me,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
assisting in energy upgrades
of some kind for what I needed

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.970 align:middle line:84%
to do to continue
fulfilling my mission,

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
or they could be
coming to give me

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
certain levels of
information and remembrances.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
a program on Gaia

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.650 align:middle line:90%
called "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And Ricardo Gonzalez talks
about his making contact

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:90%
with the ETs.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.015 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: You
have had direct contact

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
in the physical and 3D
level with the Apunians.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.297 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:13:33.297 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICARDO GONZALEZ:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, I've
had physical contact

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
with these extraterrestrials
with human appearance.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And these experiences have
also happened in the company

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:90%
of other witnesses.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the only one
who has found themselves

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:90%
face to face with these beings.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:84%
However, the question is, how
do these contact agreements

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
work with an
extraterrestrial entity?

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
When I've had to share my
testimony with the media,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they've
labeled me as being

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:90%
abducted by extraterrestrials.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I would try to correct
the journalist, saying,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:90%
I was not taken against my will.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a contact by
mutual agreement.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:84%
They extend an invitation to
those people who they feel

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
would be appropriate
for an experience.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.430 align:middle line:84%
When I say people who are
ready for an experience,

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean people who are
more evolved than others.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean people who can
handle the experience

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and who would also be
willing to talk about it.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
What would be the point of
having an extraordinary contact

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
experience if afterwards, due to
fear, you keep it to yourself?

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So having contact depends a
little more on them than on us.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.547 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ricardo obviously
chanting to Emery Smith

00:14:52.547 --> 00:14:53.505 align:middle line:90%
through an interpreter.

00:14:53.505 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Right.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But what do you think?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.117 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:14:56.117 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's
a lot in there that

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
is important to note,
which is that there

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:84%
is a mutual agreement,
which is also an invitation.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
good way that people

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.770 align:middle line:84%
can begin this
contact, is to invite

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
it, which means they need to
be ready within themselves

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.667 align:middle line:90%
for that experience.

00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these contacts for
you, Bridget, still occurring?

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.083 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: They are.

00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:84%
They're coming through
in different ways.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are coming
through in dream time.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them are coming
through in energetic upgrades

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
coming through my body,
less physical, in-person

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you summon them, or
do they just show up at will?

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: It depends.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
If there's something that
I'm needing that they can

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:90%
assist with, they will show up.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, it
is a communication,

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:84%
asking for assistance or for
guidance on something specific.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
you're not being tricked?

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, that's a
really important question.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
possible, isn't it?

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.057 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:15:48.057 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of beings out there.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not just, hey, I'm
open to contact with anyone.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
You really want to-- that's why
the invitation is really key,

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
because it installs free
will into the engagement,

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want
to be interacting--

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
very important.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.172 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, you don't want
to be interacting with beings

00:16:03.172 --> 00:16:05.077 align:middle line:84%
that just show up,
but you don't already

00:16:05.077 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:84%
have a pre-existing
relationship with.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Then you might not
know what they're in there for.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
trust factor here?

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:11.687 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:16:11.687 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Trust is really necessary.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
tricksters out there, though?

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:90%
ETs?

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what are
they trying to manipulate?

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying
to accomplish?

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I think,
in some situations,

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
they are trying to siphon energy
or to throw in their agenda,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's all different
kinds of paths and truths

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
to what humans are
wanting to go towards

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
or what the different
extraterrestrials are wanting.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
particularly, it

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.810 align:middle line:84%
can be that they have a
particular agenda of the way

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
that they think
things should go.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it can take
you off course

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
of your actual true mission
and alignment with positivity

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You seem very stable.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:90%
You seem very likable.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Thanks.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know you're
not imagining these things?

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of experience
over the past decade of doing

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:84%
these different kinds
of healing work.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
have been corroborated

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.170 align:middle line:84%
with different
actual events that

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
have happened, like different
things that I've done.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I've noticed that
they are corroborated

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:90%
with real experiences.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are also other people
having similar experiences,

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:90%
which is helpful.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that you can just

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:84%
feel that's a part of the
different kind of understanding

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're moving into is
not just a mental proof,

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:84%
but an actual
vibrational knowing.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what part
of this invitation is.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You tap into your
intuition quite often.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people have
that ability, but they don't.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't answer that little
voice in their head that says,

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:90%
don't do this.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Don't do this.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
People go ahead and do it,
and something happens to them.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they always
say, I knew it.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:90%
I should have done that.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Had that happened to you before?

00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I do my best to listen.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:90%
There are times where I don't.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And I do get slapped a
little bit by the universe

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.245 align:middle line:90%
to go in a different direction.

00:18:07.245 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
had you listened,

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't have gotten
into the mess you got into.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Exactly.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And the listening comes
through many different angles.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Like, there is that
voice in the head.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:90%
There is the gut feeling.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of body
feeling to it too.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of it's subtle.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
important to take time

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to be quiet or more still, at
least a couple minutes a day,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
or to be in meditation, so that
you can hear those subtle calls

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:84%
telling you to move
forward or telling you

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:90%
to move in a certain direction.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
totally convinced

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.587 align:middle line:84%
that you aren't
imagining these things?

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, I'm
totally convinced.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
told other people?

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I have
been public with it,

00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
because I think
that it's important

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.170 align:middle line:84%
that when we disclose
in ourselves,

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
that's a microcosm
of the macrocosm.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And that will help disclosure.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And that'll help other
people come forward

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and feel safe to share their
experiences, which will give us

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:84%
more information of how
to interact with them

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.623 align:middle line:84%
and how to connect in
a really positive way.

00:19:05.623 --> 00:19:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do some
of the people say?

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do they just go, what?

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:90%
You deal with extraterrestrials?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Or do they accept this?

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: At first,
there is a questioning.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes-- and that
might be in the moment.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:90%
It might be a couple of years.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:84%
But I've noticed that
people come back around.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And they go, hmm, you know what?

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I actually have had
an interesting dream,

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:84%
or I have had an interesting
experience, or my friend did,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that kind of helps me
understand yours a bit more.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So I've noticed that it might
feel uncomfortable at first.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But it really is helping
the collective conversation

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and movement towards this
being more normalized.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to
give a blood test, and they

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.142 align:middle line:84%
analyze it, would
it be all human?

00:19:51.142 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: That's
a great question.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, because
I don't really

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.918 align:middle line:90%
want them to have my blood.

00:19:55.918 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But is there that
possibility that there

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.863 align:middle line:90%
could be something strange?

00:19:59.863 --> 00:20:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.363 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
prepared for that?

00:20:02.363 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah, that's fine.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and--

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.547 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:20:06.547 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I feel
OK with all of this,

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:84%
because I understand
too, in my experience,

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and the different science
that I look at too,

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.870 align:middle line:84%
is that we are not
fully just human.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:84%
We do have
extraterrestrial genetics

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:90%
that we've been mixed with.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.463 align:middle line:84%
If anyone's watching
the other shows on Gaia,

00:20:21.463 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:90%
they would know that--

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: --that there's
a lot happening there.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a truth
that I feel within me.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:10%
And as I've done a lot
of different exploration

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.640 align:middle line:10%
in my ancestry and
such, I've found

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:10%
that there is that
conduit of consciousness

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:10%
to the stars through our DNA.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What percent
do you think you are?

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: I don't know.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm--

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Guess.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I'm majority
human, you know?

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But human is mixed with
extraterrestrial genetics.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 80%?

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:90%
90%?

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I'm absolutely
at least 80% human, yes.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.567 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
the other percent?

00:20:54.567 --> 00:20:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: That's for
us to find out, right?

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
exploration of this life.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.563 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you know.

00:20:59.563 --> 00:21:01.253 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I don't
actually know.

00:21:01.253 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So where do
you take this gift?

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it a gift.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: OK.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you take
it next to better humanity?

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Continuing
the conversation

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.440 align:middle line:84%
of how to integrate
consciousness, these higher

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
frequencies that people are
experiencing in the awakening

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet, and
bringing those higher energies

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
into our bodies, into
our everyday experience,

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:84%
so that we can be of service
to everyone in our lives

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and treat the planet
better, to actually

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:90%
be ambassadors for Earth.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are like,
ah, I don't know about Earth,

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:84%
or I'd rather be out in the
cosmos, or something like that.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But actually, this is
an incredible planet.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's an incredible
time and gift to be human.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of my message
is how to integrate that.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
ancestral healing?

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Ancestral
healing is that a lot

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:84%
of people's challenges and
blocks in their everyday life--

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:84%
relationships, finances,
those kinds of things--

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:84%
come from traumas and
blocks that are passed down

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:90%
in our lineage--

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:84%
wartime, famine,
all different kinds

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.750 align:middle line:84%
of things that actually is
passed down in the genetics.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
key in healing,

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and then also opening
up to our greater

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:18.150 align:middle line:84%
extrasensory perceptions and to
greater nonphysical abilities,

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.592 align:middle line:90%
to clear that way in ourselves.

00:22:21.592 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our issues
come from this.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's really key
to clean that out so

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that we can become
more integrated

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and receive more clear
communication about our purpose

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:90%
and how to be kinder humans.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Can you affect
this ancestral healing?

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Or is it what it is?

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: No, it's
absolutely moldable.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is?

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of the key
ways to heal it

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and to help resolve those
blocks, if you will,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:84%
is to just look back
and see what happened,

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:90%
to acknowledge what happened.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:84%
That scene brings
illumination to your ancestry,

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
to your lineage, so that
more energy, and light,

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness can flow.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To give
us an illustration,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.630 align:middle line:84%
host Lisa Garr
talked to Denise Linn

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:90%
about exactly what you said.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DENISE LINN: When you begin
to understand that everybody is

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:84%
acting according to
their upbringing,

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and their upbringing is a result
of their parents' upbringing

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:90%
it keeps going back generations.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And they've done some really
interesting research, what's

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:90%
called the ancestral syndrome.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And they've found that trauma
travels through the genes,

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.720 align:middle line:84%
But then there's even things
that almost seem esoteric.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- as a result
of scientific research,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:84%
religion travels
through the genes.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And so when there is
trauma, for example,

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
if that is traveling-- if your
great-grandparents had trauma,

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.510 align:middle line:84%
literally, there's a biochemical
shift that goes generation

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:90%
after generation.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
research with mice.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And they'll program mice to
really dislike the smell of--

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:90%
what is it?

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Sweet cherry.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:10%
And then what they've
found is generations later,

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:10%
mice will have an
aversion to that,

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.050 align:middle line:10%
even though they were never
exposed to it, because it

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.205 align:middle line:10%
travels through the genes.

00:24:18.205 --> 00:24:19.372 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: The genes, yes.

00:24:19.372 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:10%
>>LINN: And so I do work
with past life regression.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But I also do work with going
back into early childhood

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to unweave
some of those patterns

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:84%
but also to trace
our ancestors back.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And we are-- the Western culture
is one of the few cultures that

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
doesn't revere the ancestors,
honor the ancestors,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and actually think
about the ancestors.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent
that you can discover

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
what those patterns were and
where they live inside of

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.772 align:middle line:84%
you is to the extent that you
can begin to release them.

00:24:53.772 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bridget, she echoes
a lot of things you just said.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, I
love what she shared.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's true, because in
the Western culture today,

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:84%
we've been disconnected
from our roots, actual--

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
our ancestral roots and
the physical ground where

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of us came from
generation after generation.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we've
forgotten that this is

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.990 align:middle line:84%
a key part of continuing
forward in a healthy way,

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.162 align:middle line:84%
remembering to honor them,
remembering to also clear out

00:25:20.162 --> 00:25:22.120 align:middle line:84%
the things that we don't
want to carry forward.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you be
at these ability points

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.720 align:middle line:84%
if you did not have
the ET contact?

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I wouldn't
be at the ET contact

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.970 align:middle line:84%
without the ancestral healing
and without the other healing

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:35.770 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I really feel that
that's what opened me up

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.957 align:middle line:84%
to be able to handle,
as he was saying,

00:25:40.957 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:90%
these contact experiences.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
driving force for you?

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
cosmic consciousness?

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Cosmic
consciousness is

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
an energy coming from
the universe that

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
is aligned with oneness,
is aligned with harmony,

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.422 align:middle line:90%
is unified in its nature.

00:25:56.422 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's what the Dalai
Lama talks about all the time,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He talks about
oneness all the time.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And to us, as
humans, that starts

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:84%
to get a little bit
confusing, because we're

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
very conditioned to
think of our separateness

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:90%
and think of our individuality.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality, when you
get to higher densities

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and higher levels
of consciousness,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.220 align:middle line:90%
you move into oneness.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:84%
You move into unity
and truly realize,

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
on a deep, fundamental
level, that we

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.970 align:middle line:90%
are absolutely interconnected.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.080 align:middle line:90%
We are right now.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We just don't
remember that we are.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And so once you get to those
levels of consciousness,

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:84%
it just is, that you are a
collective, inherent energy,

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:90%
working as one.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This intuitiveness
that you possess--

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.130 align:middle line:84%
is it good for you,
or is it good for you

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:90%
helping others, or both?

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It's very
helpful for both.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.690 align:middle line:84%
It's been very helpful on my
path so that I can key into

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and tune into what feels
aligned to me, what doesn't,

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:90%
in different areas of my life.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely
meant to be of service.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why I feel like I have
it, is to help other people.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, your
80% of you that's human--

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.192 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Right.

00:27:09.192 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you have your
ups and downs in life,

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.390 align:middle line:90%
like most humans do.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:18.063 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you tap into this
healing process to better that?

00:27:18.063 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:90%
I do it all the time.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm always tapping in.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm always utilizing
that ability

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to just connect inward
to myself and to go

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
into different areas
of my body, to go

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:84%
into different areas
of my energetic field,

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and to let go of those
things that don't serve me.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm doing the
healing on myself

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.058 align:middle line:84%
as well, because you
can only heal as well--

00:27:39.058 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
other people and help them as
much as you've helped yourself.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let me
give you an example,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:10%
and you tell me how
you would handle this.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: OK.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Person comes
to you and says,

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Bridget, I'm
stressed to the max.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've got anxiety.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't understand
what's happening to me.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.850 align:middle line:90%
But I'm unhappy at work.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm unhappy in a
relationship I'm in.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:90%
But they're stressed to the max.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.420 align:middle line:90%
And they've got this anxiety.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:84%
How do you
intuitively heal them?

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, there's a
lot of origins where that

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.110 align:middle line:90%
could be coming from, right?

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: As you
laid out this example.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first and
primary thing for everyone

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:84%
is to be following your passion,
to be excited for what you're

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:90%
doing in your everyday life.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
That's really, really
essential, and then

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:27.780 align:middle line:84%
to align your life with that,
so your job, your relationship.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So those are just the
surface levels of that.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.568 align:middle line:90%
But you can go deeper.

00:28:31.568 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And I would go a
level deeper and go,

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.810 align:middle line:84%
why are you in this
job and relationship

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.770 align:middle line:90%
that you don't like?

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it does have roots
in ancestral blockages,

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:84%
where someone had to overextend
themself for the family,

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and so they went into something
they didn't like to do because

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.837 align:middle line:90%
of this war or famine, right?

00:28:48.837 --> 00:28:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True, true.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So I would
look at those core roots,

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:84%
but also just move into areas of
life that are more harmonious.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:90%
We have choice.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel
like it sometimes.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But truly, when you are working
with a positive belief system

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
structure, there is always
choice and the ability

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
to change into something that
is more alignment with us, which

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:84%
will be helpful to ourselves,
our relationships, and everyone

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:13.940 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When does that
person start to see results?

00:29:17.283 --> 00:29:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It's really
up to the person,

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.890 align:middle line:84%
because the thing
is is I can move

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:84%
certain energy or certain
blocks or illuminate what

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:84%
might be going on with them,
which can allow more space

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
or allow more empowerment
to then make a change.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But it really is up to the
person to make that change

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and make that shift
in their life.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And when they do,
it's a cascade.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So many beautiful things unfold,
and a momentum that's positive

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.132 align:middle line:84%
starts in their life and
starts affecting everything.

00:29:48.132 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a
snowball effect, isn't it?

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely, yes.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it gets better, and
better, and better for people.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Every little action,
every little shift,

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:84%
it adds up, because even one
little direction this way

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:84%
will lead to a big
shift in the long term.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to
have a producer in St.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Louis for my radio show there,
would come into work and say,

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have a lousy day.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:84%
He would bring this black
cloud over his head.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:90%
He had a lousy day.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:90%
He made it happen to himself.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you change an
individual like that?

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:90%
He was a nice guy, by the way.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he had
this cloud that he

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.880 align:middle line:90%
would bring in all the time.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He'd walk in that way.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you fix that?

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: The first
key is asking them

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:84%
if they're open to changing,
if they're willing,

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.250 align:middle line:90%
if they're open to changing.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't want to change.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
that they want to be.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:90%
But that desire, that fire to--

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.020 align:middle line:90%
I do want something better.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I do want a better
life or to not have

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.790 align:middle line:90%
a cloud over my head every day.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:57.447 align:middle line:84%
They have to actually have that
desire and openness to change.

00:30:57.447 --> 00:30:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Otherwise,
nothing can happen.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:90%
And just, there's only sadness.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have
to do it themselves.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yep.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of karma?

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: I believe in it.

00:31:05.475 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What goes
around comes around?

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: It does.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:84%
What you put out is what
you get back, absolutely.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that too.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how
ancient is that belief?

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Oh, I feel
like it's very ancient.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it goes back
to the beginning of humankind,

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.690 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.733 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a lot of the
caramel we're playing out

00:31:22.733 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:84%
right now on Earth has to do
with what came and happened

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.335 align:middle line:90%
in the stars.

00:31:26.335 --> 00:31:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here's an example.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a homeless
person in LA many months ago.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:90%
And I just feel sorry for them.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I can't not help
them when I see them.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Whether they come up to
me or I come up to them,

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I have to help them.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And I gave this person a
$20 bill out of my heart.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect anything.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even want them to
say, thank you, thank you.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I just gave it to them
because I wanted to.

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And that made me
feel better about it.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then I
went to my post office.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And there was a check there
for $1,500 from my insurance

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.510 align:middle line:90%
company that I wasn't expecting.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.340 align:middle line:90%
How does this happen?

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: George,
that's so beautiful.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It happens because you're in
flow and in synchronization

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.990 align:middle line:90%
with positivity.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And positivity is abundance.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:84%
You realize that you
are whole, and you

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.530 align:middle line:84%
realize that you were connected
to that person, right?

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:84%
There was that empathic
exchange that was happening.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And because of that oneness,
because of that wholeness,

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.330 align:middle line:90%
that relates to abundance.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So now I give out 20s
all the time, just for fun.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:39.020 align:middle line:84%
How does consciousness tie
into the Inner Earth theory?

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Oh, yes.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:41.910 align:middle line:90%
It's very big, because--

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And describe the
Inner Earth theory for us.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.693 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah,
consciousness ties into it,

00:32:45.693 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:84%
because the Inner Earth
civilizations-- and the theory

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.920 align:middle line:84%
is, which I've had experiences,
which we'll probably

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.250 align:middle line:84%
talk about, is that there are
civilizations actually living

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.447 align:middle line:90%
inside Inner Earth.

00:32:56.447 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You believe that?

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
center of the planet?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.670 align:middle line:84%
They are-- that's where
consciousness comes in.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.787 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Humans or--

00:33:02.787 --> 00:33:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: They're humans.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are quasi-humans,
so some off-planet genetics.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Physical?

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Physical.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: But the
consciousness ties in,

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.672 align:middle line:84%
because they're from
another dimension, right?

00:33:12.672 --> 00:33:13.880 align:middle line:90%
So they're fifth-dimensional.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ooh.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So they
have a different level

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:17.900 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness than us.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine it,
just like on the surface

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.050 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, when we
want to talk about fairies,

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:84%
or Sasquatch, or things
that seem mythical, you

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.090 align:middle line:90%
can see them.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Kids see them all
the time if you're

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.420 align:middle line:90%
in that frequency bandwidth.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So these civilizations are
in this higher-frequency

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:40.430 align:middle line:84%
bandwidth, which not
all of us can tap into,

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.510 align:middle line:90%
but they are physical.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
they want to live

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.510 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the planet?

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I would miss the sun, the
moon, and the atmosphere.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, they do have
artificial atmospheres

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful
different situations

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:84%
down there that
are quite amazing.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.550 align:middle line:84%
If anything, they're cleaner
than the surface of the planet,

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.800 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the reasons
why they went Inner Earth,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:84%
is because the planet became
pretty radiated and toxic

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.550 align:middle line:84%
to their preferences that
aligned them with the ability

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.710 align:middle line:84%
to stay in that level
of consciousness.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may be too young to
remember the original "Journey

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:84%
to the Center of the
Earth" with Pat Boone.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But inside the planet,
within the planet,

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.280 align:middle line:84%
there was a small sun, with
a sky and everything else,

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.482 align:middle line:90%
within the planet.

00:34:26.482 --> 00:34:27.282 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:34:27.282 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.569 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:34:28.569 --> 00:34:29.369 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Oceans.

00:34:29.369 --> 00:34:30.393 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and oceans.

00:34:30.393 --> 00:34:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And an ocean.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dinosaurs.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:90%
They had it all.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they've kept all
the different animals

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and plants that have even
become extinct on the surface

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:41.659 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you
brought that up,

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.445 align:middle line:84%
because I remember that that
was one of my favorite books

00:34:45.445 --> 00:34:46.576 align:middle line:90%
growing up, so--

00:34:46.576 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a classic.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:48.459 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:34:48.459 --> 00:34:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
a classic indeed.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.520 align:middle line:84%
The several ways that you can
experience the Inner Earth

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.320 align:middle line:90%
feeling--

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:90%
watch this.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1997, Holley Moyes, an
archaeologist at the University

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.060 align:middle line:84%
of California, led an expedition
to survey a large cave system

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:11.650 align:middle line:84%
in Belize known as
Actun Tunichil Muknal.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.980 align:middle line:84%
As they followed a bizarre
complex of chambers

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.150 align:middle line:84%
three miles into the earth,
they discovered thousands

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:23.890 align:middle line:84%
of offerings to ancient gods,
including the skeletal remains

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.590 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of
human sacrifices,

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and tools and ceramics made
from the semiprecious stone

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.080 align:middle line:90%
obsidian.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:84%
What made this find
even more unusual

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:84%
was that as Holley and her
team followed the trail

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper into the cave,
it appeared to have no end.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Where would it
ultimately lead to?

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.630 align:middle line:10%
Descriptions of the
caves in the Popol

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:10%
Vuh, and ancient
Maya creation myth,

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.680 align:middle line:10%
has led many to believe these
archaeologists had uncovered

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.530 align:middle line:10%
an opening to the
ancient underworld known

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:06.050 align:middle line:10%
as Xibalba, a much-feared
threshold to the afterlife.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:07.467 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is remarkable.

00:36:07.467 --> 00:36:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Isn't it?

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was going on
in the center of the planet?

00:36:11.725 --> 00:36:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: There's
a lot of stuff

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.350 align:middle line:84%
going on in the center
of the planet, and even

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:18.770 align:middle line:84%
some of the cave systems
that are just below as well.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend in South
America actually going

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:90%
on this trek to a sacred site.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.165 align:middle line:84%
And she was met by all
these reptilians, actually--

00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: --at that time,
that lived at the center,

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:32.300 align:middle line:84%
like just below the
Earth's surface.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And they came, and they
took her and her friends.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:90%
And then they did let them go.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's positive,
benevolent beings there.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also
reptilians as well.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.303 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of things
going on that we don't see.

00:36:44.303 --> 00:36:46.303 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sure you're
familiar with the diary

00:36:46.303 --> 00:36:47.410 align:middle line:90%
of Admiral Byrd.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yes.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he went into
the center of the planet

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:90%
and saw these incredible things.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.845 align:middle line:90%
What a story.

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: It's incredible.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:84%
There are so many accounts
from the early 20th century

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:90%
of these voyages going in.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And because time passes, we
just count them off as fiction.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.440 align:middle line:84%
But there's a real reality
to what's going on there.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to your
ET experiences again--

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.728 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, when
you go back home,

00:37:11.728 --> 00:37:12.770 align:middle line:90%
is this where it happens?

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Or does it happen everywhere?

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It happens-- well,
my home is usually in sacred

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:84%
sites, so places where magnetic
lines, ley lines cross,

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:21.290 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's very powerful.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.152 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: It's a very
important key piece to why

00:37:25.152 --> 00:37:26.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm having these experiences.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:84%
People can have them in a
skyrise in New York City too.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's not saying that
that can't happen as well.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you want
more of a frequency,

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.290 align:middle line:84%
a consistency to
these experiences,

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:90%
then I go to Mount Shasta.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm in Sedona.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm going to
these different places.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And I have more of
these experiences.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I have more dream time
recollection and guidance.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:51.027 align:middle line:84%
Is there a craft associated
with these visitations of ETs?

00:37:51.027 --> 00:37:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Different ones.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So connected with
Inner Earth, I've

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.480 align:middle line:84%
had lots of
connections and dreams

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:02.030 align:middle line:84%
in Mount Shasta of 1950s-type
spacecraft going into Mount

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Shasta, which is Telos.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot about that,
connected to the whole Agartha

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:07.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're dreams?

00:38:07.663 --> 00:38:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: They're dreams,
but they're lucid dreams.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:90%
So I'm conscious.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm aware.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And I am astrally
traveling to the center

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:17.680 align:middle line:84%
of, say, Mount Shasta on
their ships and exploring.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.597 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been taken on a craft--

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:20.513 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Physically?

00:38:20.513 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --somewhere to a
different planetary system?

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Usually not quite--
yes, but not usually not,

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.960 align:middle line:90%
usually just outside of Earth.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it like?

00:38:31.735 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I mean,
it's different

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:35.720 align:middle line:84%
depending on which beings
I'm interacting with.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is absolutely
ecstatic, like just

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:42.230 align:middle line:90%
so beautiful and so high.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And then some of them
that were more abduction

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.990 align:middle line:90%
experiences can be more dense.

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:49.302 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:38:49.302 --> 00:38:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: At times, I
was, when I was younger,

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:90%
with the abduction experiences.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
because I somehow

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.980 align:middle line:84%
remembered that there was
a purpose to all of it,

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.077 align:middle line:84%
and I understood that,
it made me less scared,

00:39:01.077 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
say, than other people had--
when they have experiences.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they
communicate with you, Bridget?

00:39:05.535 --> 00:39:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Telepathy?

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Telepathy
is the primary means

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.680 align:middle line:90%
of communication, yes.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Which beings?

00:39:13.455 --> 00:39:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Any of them?

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Any of them.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I think generally,
they're wanting--

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:84%
well, some of them are
wanting the betterment

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:21.620 align:middle line:90%
of their own races.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.863 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are wanting energy.

00:39:23.863 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
different reasons.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.620 align:middle line:84%
But the benevolent
ones are wanting

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to help Earth, because
they realize, just

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:31.913 align:middle line:90%
like on a personal level--

00:39:31.913 --> 00:39:32.713 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:39:32.713 --> 00:39:34.040 align:middle line:90%
So they do care about us?

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: Yes, the
benevolent ones definitely do.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David Jacobs,
great ufologist,

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:44.240 align:middle line:84%
says there's a very nefarious
purpose for visitations.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
He said, be very, very scared
of why they're coming here.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.480 align:middle line:90%
You don't seem to think that.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: No, that's not my
experience with some of them.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.717 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, I do
agree with that.

00:39:55.717 --> 00:39:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you do?

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
had a bad experience?

00:39:58.555 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: I've had telepathic
and energetic experiences,

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.520 align:middle line:84%
where, say, darker reptilians
want to kind of creep

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:90%
in energetically.

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.100 align:middle line:90%
And I can feel it.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:90%
And I just say no.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Like, you're not allowed here.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And that energy-- but that's
depending on my energy, right?

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So much of what we're connecting
to out there and which

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.580 align:middle line:84%
types of beings we're
calling in or connecting with

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:84%
depends on our frequency,
conscious and subconscious.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.500 align:middle line:90%
So it's really important.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are benevolent
extraterrestrials, absolutely,

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.700 align:middle line:84%
that are wanting to help us,
because they realize that we're

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:84%
a part of them, because
they're operating on unity,

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.416 align:middle line:90%
oneness, consciousness.

00:40:36.416 --> 00:40:37.291 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NIELSEN: So they
want to bring with them

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.140 align:middle line:90%
the kind of outliers, right?

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.170 align:middle line:10%
The ones that are-- it's
like the broken pieces in us,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:49.100 align:middle line:10%
maybe those subconscious pieces,
maybe those fragmented aspects.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.840 align:middle line:10%
When we're doing
different healing work,

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.125 align:middle line:10%
we want to include them.

00:40:52.125 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:10%
They're a part of us.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:10%
We want to bring them with us.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.980 align:middle line:10%
And these extraterrestrials
think of us like that.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.920 align:middle line:10%
We're a little microcosm
of their greater macro.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.990 align:middle line:90%
And so they want to help us.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, we
are them, right?

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:10%
Because we're in many places
at once on soul levels.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And so there is that
collective consciousness effort

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.010 align:middle line:90%
for that positivity.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you work with other
clients and try to help them?

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: I do.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.230 align:middle line:84%
I usually do group
settings, different kinds

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.090 align:middle line:84%
of online courses or
in-person programs.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing as much
one-on-one connection

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.970 align:middle line:84%
anymore, because have a lot of
people that I'm working with,

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:90%
but absolutely.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief," Bridget.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating work.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NIELSEN: Thank you so much.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me, George.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She's an
intuitive healer,

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:41.600 align:middle line:10%
which means she's healing
not only the physical,

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.970 align:middle line:10%
but the emotional.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:44.410 align:middle line:10%
And she gets it done.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:45.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
