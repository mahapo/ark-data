>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Katie Paige is with us.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:10%
She is Colorado's Mutual UFO
Network's state director,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:10%
and she's a star
investigator for MUFON

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:10%
and is the team lead and
administrator for MUFON's Mars

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:10%
team.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not talking
about the planet, are we?

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.678 align:middle line:90%
>>KATIE PAIGE: No, we're not.

00:00:34.678 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:10%
Mars actually was set
up before we had the CMS

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:10%
and all our reports were
put online on the computer.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.830 align:middle line:10%
Everything was done the
old-fashioned way by paper,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:10%
and we had over 10,000
reports pre-CMS.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:10%
And we had a team of
redactors, about 15

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:10%
of us that spent
three years taking out

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:10%
all the private personal
information from all

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:10%
these paper reports, and they're
all put into a database now.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So researchers and historians
can access that data

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:84%
more easily, which will be
set to roll out hopefully

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:90%
in the next couple of years.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.642 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long have you been
a state director for MUFON?

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: It's been
three years now.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.267 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I was assistant
state director before that

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:90%
for the state of Colorado.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get interested in UFOs?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, I started
out kind of interested

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:90%
in paranormal things.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:84%
When I was a young girl,
I had many experiences

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.400 align:middle line:84%
of high strangeness out
on a Colorado ranch,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and I had a lot of
unanswered questions

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:84%
about what happened out
there all those years ago.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.667 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
in Elbert County?

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: It is an
Elbert County, Colorado,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:90%
in a small town called Kiowa.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And we were threatened
and warned never

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:84%
to talk about what
happened out there,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and I never knew
anybody knew anything

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
about what we experienced out
there on this ranch property.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So I came in, I learned about
MUFON from a documentary

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
on television.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And I came in right as a
field investigator just

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
to see what I can find out
about this whole world of UFOs

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.375 align:middle line:84%
and possible answers to what
happened all those years ago

00:01:58.375 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
out there on that
ranch property.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, tell us
about this ranch and what

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.750 align:middle line:90%
might have happened.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, so like I
said, my sister and my mom--

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:90%
my mom dated a gentleman.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
She worked for a large
airline, United Airlines

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:90%
as a computer operator.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:90%
They're based out this way.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.445 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, yeah, out there
in the Denver Tech Center.

00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And she started
dating this gentleman,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and he and his family owned
this ranch out there in Kiowa.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And the minute they
moved on the property,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
they started hearing
loud humming sounds

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and bangs under the ground.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
The property sat vacant
for at least 12 years

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:90%
before they even moved in.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So there was always
rumors and speculation

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:84%
about this property of orbs
flying on and off the property,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
UFOs being spotted,
and things like that.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So the two younger
sons that lived there,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:84%
lived with us-- we lived
in Englewood, Colorado,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:90%
about an hour away.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So they would commute
back and forth

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
to go to a large school
district here in Colorado.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent a handful
of times on weekends there,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
but every Sunday night, when
the boys would come back,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
we would hear about
all the happenings.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The biggest phenomenon that
was occurring out there

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:84%
at the time-- and this
is from 1975 to 1978.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.725 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's a long
time ago, but we still

00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
don't have answers to what
was happening out there.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:84%
But cattle mutilations were
at really high, high levels.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Linda Moulton Howe actually
got her start out there

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:90%
as an investigative journalist.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exactly right.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Researching
all these mutilations

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of not just cow, but horse,
sheep, and even dogs.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the ranch.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was, I found out later
through George Knapp and Colm

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Kelleher's book, "Hunt for
the Skinwalker," that's

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:84%
where I first learned
that anybody knew anything

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:90%
about the ranch property.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I learned that Dr. Leo Sprinkle,
PhD, investigated that along

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.197 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. John Derr,
PhD and Peter--

00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a
lot of heavyweights

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
ufology out that way.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, and
I was just stunned

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
to find out that
anybody knew anything

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:90%
about this ranch property.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So the last 10 years, I've been
really researching and digging

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.558 align:middle line:84%
for documents of what was really
going on there at the time.

00:04:04.558 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It truly is.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did you uncover?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Fortunately for
me, Dr. Leo Sprinkle,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.675 align:middle line:84%
who was just a wonderful man
and a pioneer in the field for--

00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God rest his soul.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yes, yes,
we unfortunately

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:90%
lost him this last year.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But he was an amazing
man, and he actually

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
has all his archives
there at the Heritage

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Center in Laramie, Wyoming.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's only a quick
two and a half hour drive.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So I went out there and got
all the original documents out

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:84%
of that archives, and
what I found eye-opening

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.020 align:middle line:84%
for me is that it was very
clear that the military was

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:84%
very aware of what was
happening out there

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:90%
on the ranch property.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
There were notes about
NORAD being informed

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:84%
of what was there, and even
a person from Camp Carson

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:84%
was out there on
the ranch property.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.345 align:middle line:84%
So I know there was a
heavy military influence--

00:04:55.345 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
was happening.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.095 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Something
was happening.

00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So as an investigator and
an experiencer out there,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:84%
the question's always been
for me, how much of it

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
was military, and how
much of it was actual UFO

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:90%
paranormal experiences?

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of
the question I've

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
been trying to answer and
uncover all these years.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty dramatic.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever find anything
on the ranch personally

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that would convince you
this thing is being visited,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:90%
this place is visited?

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, one of
the early memories I

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
have, my older sister and I,
it was like a typical Colorado

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:90%
spring day.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And here in Colorado, we
get these wet, heavy snows,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:84%
but the sun will shine
and the sky will be blue.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:84%
If you live out here, you
know what I'm talking about.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hopefully you get
a lot of wet heavy snows

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:90%
out here, right?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.435 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, right.

00:05:44.435 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And we were out in front
of the ranch property

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:84%
just flipping the
frisbee back and forth.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And we looked down, and
there was this large circle

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, and it
was just completely dry,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:90%
and nothing grew in this circle.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.433 align:middle line:84%
And being an investigator
and researcher,

00:06:00.433 --> 00:06:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, could there
have been a missile silo there

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.557 align:middle line:84%
or whatever looking
back, but that was--

00:06:04.557 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A perfect circle.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Perfect circle.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting, when
I went back to the archives

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
of Dr. Sprinkle's--

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sprinkle gave me a
document that actually had--

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:90%
it was 75 feet in diameter.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
There were two of
these circles, snowless

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:90%
circles on the property.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the
documents, it actually

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:84%
said there were drops of blood
outside the circle, which

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:90%
was kind of terrifying.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's one thing I remember,
and to have that actually

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:84%
verified in the document
was like really neat

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
to see that because
that was a memory.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, did something
happened to you out that way?

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean were you--

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I have heard rumors that
you were threatened.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yes.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By whom and why?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, that's something
I always have questions about.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So one of the most
terrifying nights

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.090 align:middle line:84%
we had out there, my sister
and I and the three boys--

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the
boys' mother's birthday.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So we were out there
over the weekend

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:90%
celebrating her birthday.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
All the adults, it
was after midnight.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.070 align:middle line:84%
They were in the front ranch
house playing board games,

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and we were-- the kids were all
hanging out in the boys' room.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was late,
early in the morning,

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden that
humming noise started up,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.735 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was
like freaking out.

00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:90%
There's that humming noise.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Because any time that
humming noise happened,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:90%
strange things began to happen.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that moment, all the
power in the house went out.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's dark.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:90%
We're all scared.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And then at that moment
we had this booming voice.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It sounded like
it was coming out

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
of every orifice in the
house, but it was basically

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:90%
this warning.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:90%
We have allowed you to remain.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Your friends will be instructed
to remain silent concerning us.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Don't take action that we
will regret and duh, duh, duh.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So I had memories of
that, and my sister also

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
has memories of that
most terrifying night.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And that, exactly what it said,
was in that briefing document

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Another confirmation
out of the report, which

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:90%
was really, really neat to see.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was the box?

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, so there
was this box that was

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:90%
reported to be seen out there.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, the adults saw
that box several times.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:90%
I witnessed the box one time.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:90%
It was during the day.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
They had a pickup
truck and hound dogs,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and we were driving--
there's a bank of ponderosa

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:90%
pines behind the ranch house.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And we were in the pickup
truck driving around the back

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.720 align:middle line:90%
in the ponderosa pines.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And we get out of the truck,
and that humming noise-- well,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:84%
it sounded more like
bees started up.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: And all of
a sudden, the adult--

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
his name was John-- is
like, get back in the truck!

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Get back in the truck!

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.315 align:middle line:84%
And in the trees, you
could see this box.

00:08:33.315 --> 00:08:36.659 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's about two feet by a
foot, and it had lights on it,

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:90%
and it made this strange sound.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like
somebody put it there?

00:08:40.865 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I don't know
who put it there,

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.159 align:middle line:84%
but when we jumped
back in the truck,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I looked back into the
trees, and that box was gone.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it was
reported, this box would--

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's bizarre.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.798 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Be there
and not be there.

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
It's so bizarre, I didn't
even talk about it for years

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:90%
because it's just so strange.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I started
hearing other high strangeness

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
locations, like Skinwalker
Ranch and Trey Hudson's ranch

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
in the South, the
South Skinwalker

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Ranch that also have experiences
with these strange boxes.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken Cherry is a former
Texas MUFON state director.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:84%
He talked on Gaia's "Open Minds"
series about his first UFO

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.480 align:middle line:10%
>>KEN CHERRY: When
I was about seven,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:10%
I was alone on our
ranch at the time

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:10%
and came through into a
clearing and looked up,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:10%
and there was this silvery
object going across the horizon

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:10%
just slowly.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at that
age, I had no comprehension

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:84%
of the types of vehicles
or aircraft or anything

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:90%
of that nature.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I know, there
was this craft coming down

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:84%
at a very rapid speed
toward the silvery object.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it
was the glint of the sun

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:84%
or if there was some
interaction between the object

00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and the craft, but there was
like a lightning or something.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I knew, the pilot
of the plane bailed out,

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and the craft started
billowing smoke

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:90%
and crashed into the ground.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.775 align:middle line:90%
The silvery object took off.

00:10:11.775 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Back in those days, I mean,
kids were to be heard--

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.223 align:middle line:84%
I mean to be seen and not
heard, so I really never

00:10:20.223 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:84%
had a chance to discuss
it with anybody.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
But whenever my parents would
get together with neighbors,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:84%
all they could talk about
was rescuing this pilot

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:90%
from the trees.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And I later realized that
this was one of our early jets

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:90%
that had--

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
it tried to attack or
force down a flying saucer.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And this would have been
about 1952, when we still

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:90%
had this order standing--

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
force them down or
shoot them down.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it never
really worked.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I think, a
General Chidlaw said, we

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
were losing an aircraft a
day around the world trying

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:90%
to force down saucers.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So they finally gave up on
that, and the saucers apparently

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:90%
were just in defensive mode.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.351 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a major UFO
flap in this country in 1952,

00:11:14.351 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:90%
a UFO spotted over the Capitol.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible story.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But he's pretty
convincing, isn't he?

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, oh my gosh.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
That actually goes right along
with in that briefing document

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that I acquired from
John Schuessler,

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
it talks about-- and also
in Dr. Leo Sprinkle's files

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:84%
that there were two A-7D
interceptors in pursuit

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:84%
of a UFO that actually crashed
there in Elbert County that

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:90%
occurred on November 11, 1975.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So I actually ran
into Richard Doty

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
at one of the
conferences in Laughlin,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him a
couple of questions.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I asked him, A, if he was
aware of that ranch property.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:84%
In the A.P.R.O folklore, it was
known as the Clearview Ranch

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:90%
or the Rocky Mountain Ranch.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And the location was
unknown because the people

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.380 align:middle line:84%
of the town and the sheriff,
George Yarnell, and Bill Waugh,

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
they did not want any publicity
or to bring the masses down

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:90%
around the town.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But he said that, yes, he was
aware of that property, which

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:90%
was really interesting to me.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And number two, that if I wanted
any information on those two

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
A-7Ds that crashed out there
to go ahead and send a FOIA

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
request into Kirkland
Air Force Base--

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you get any info?

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I did.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:90%
I got a nice big thick envelope.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all that
where it gets really

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:90%
juicy and interesting, big--

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blacked out.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Big, blacked out boxes.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But what's fascinating
to me was supposedly,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:84%
it was an instructor
and a student pilot

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
out of Buckley Air Force
Base, which now, of course,

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:90%
is Space Force.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:90%
But this was at night.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I learned that they had 255
live rounds of ammunition

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:84%
on board, which I thought was
interesting with the student

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.047 align:middle line:84%
pilot flying over residential
farms and ranches.

00:13:10.047 --> 00:13:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's kind of dangerous.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I think that's
kind of dangerous.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the causes
that were listed

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
that the instructor
misidentified

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
another craft as the student's,
and the student turned

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
off his beacon light and
instead of turning it on

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and hit his tail and
they both went down.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:84%
They both ejected, and
they both survived.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:84%
But I found it interesting
that they never

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.630 align:middle line:84%
identified, either with
the radio transcripts

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.710 align:middle line:84%
or the pilot never identified
what that other craft was.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And then just recently,
I was at David Marler's.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
He has a very large historian,
all sorts of documents

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:90%
and newspaper articles.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And I ran across an article
around that same time

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
out of Canada that
the Air Force actually

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.353 align:middle line:84%
did scramble a couple of
jets in pursuit of a UFO.

00:13:59.353 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:90%
So we know they've done it--

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
chasing something.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: They were
chasing something,

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and I believe they were
chasing something, yeah.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
sketches from the Elbert Ranch

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
that I want you to take
a look at and react.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.603 align:middle line:84%
Our first is a
so-called alien drawing

00:14:12.603 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
of what might have
been out there.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, again, the
image there close to you,

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
George, that was the
actual sketch that

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.248 align:middle line:84%
was in the files at Dr.
Sprinkle's of the alien

00:14:24.248 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:84%
being-- one of the types
that were seen out there

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:90%
on the ranch.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:10%
And this sketch there on
the left, closest to me,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:10%
is a sketch from a gentleman
named Sean Bartok, who

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book called
"Flashbacks,"

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:10%
and he had a property that
was just 14 miles away

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:10%
from where the ranch sat,
and this was the being

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.972 align:middle line:10%
they saw around that time.

00:14:44.972 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was an eyewitness

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.972 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Right, and I
don't know about you,

00:14:47.972 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
but I find them to
look eerily similar.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And those tubes in the neck
there, he said actually

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.180 align:middle line:90%
would expand out.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.722 align:middle line:84%
Those are actually
tubes in his neck.

00:14:59.722 --> 00:15:00.888 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:15:00.888 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: So out there
on the ranch property,

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:84%
they said they had these
type of beings seen out there

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:90%
and a Nordic type of being.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said, they
appeared to be in conflict

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.470 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.235 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the next picture
here and see what this is.

00:15:15.235 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Again, that's--

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a different
perspective of what we saw.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Look at the arms.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Right.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and through the years--

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It looks robotic.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.908 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Well, exactly.

00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I was actually at the grocery
store standing in line,

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and there was a copy
of "Popular Mechanics,"

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and it was a big
article about AI.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.862 align:middle line:84%
And they had these tubey
things and I thought--

00:15:36.862 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like him.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, I really
think this could possibly

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:90%
be some sort of AI.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And I also through
the years think

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that whatever those boxes may
be that were seen at the ranch

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
property are most likely
connected to these beings here.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is that
screen in front of him?

00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I don't know.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
In the document, it
actually it describes it

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
as more of a
three-dimensional type thing.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks flat
in that photograph,

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.103 align:middle line:84%
but the arms and legs are
almost spider, you know--

00:16:05.103 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks
like a praying mantis.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:07.687 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, almost.

00:16:07.687 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that's
a shield or what that is.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And there was
supposedly some sort

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:84%
of clear apparatus
over the head.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at our
next picture here.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, again,
this is-- yeah,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.237 align:middle line:84%
those are those images
from that issue.

00:16:24.237 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw that, it just
kind of clicked in my brain

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that possibly that could
be an AI maybe connected

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:90%
to the boxes.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:10%
And then the image
there on the far right

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:10%
is that Sean Bartok's
drawing of those tubes that

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:10%
are in the neck coming out.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.570 align:middle line:10%
So I think it's very
unusual because it's not

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:10%
like anything you really
see in movies or the--

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Stereotypical Greys
that you often hear about.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.527 align:middle line:90%
They're very unique looking.

00:16:52.527 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Another phenomenon--

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.947 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This
looks like Bigfoot.

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, and when
I was a young girl--

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:84%
so during the ranch time,
I'm 9 to 12 years old

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:90%
during these years.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And they called
them white fuzzies

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
because they had like
gray hair, but they

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:84%
had these Bigfoot
Sasquatch creatures that

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
were seen at the ranch
property, and that was a sketch

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:90%
of what was drawn there.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
years later, at a conference,

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I meet Bob Salas,
and he was talking

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
about very similar experiences
happening up in Montana

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and happened to
have an airman that

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
passed a polygraph test
seeing these creatures,

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and they are almost
identical to these as well.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How prevalent, Katie,
was the military presence out

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:90%
at this ranch?

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I think it
was very prevalent.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.448 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the big things
that happened out there a lot

00:17:41.448 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
were these mysterious unmarked
helicopters flying off and off

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:90%
of our properties.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And it made me wonder,
like were the military

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:84%
responsible for a lot of
these cattle mutilations?

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Were they taking
the cattle and why?

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:84%
There's missile silos out
there, the Titan missile silos.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Were they testing the water?

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Were they testing the soil?

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.442 align:middle line:84%
But as you can see,
that Elbert Ranch

00:18:05.442 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:84%
is that big red star there, and
we had the Air Force Academy.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And back in the
mid to late '70s,

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
their property ran clear up
close to the ranch property.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we have Cheyenne
Mountain, of course, NORAD,

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Fort Carson, Schrievner,
Peterson Air Force base,

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and there's also Butte,
which had a huge collection

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:90%
of the helicopters out there.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's, like I said,
it was always my question.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Chicken or the egg?

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Were they out there
causing the activity,

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
or were they out there
investigating or both?

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or both.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Or both.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or both.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Military bases seem
to be associated

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of UFO sightings.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:90%
What is your thoughts on that?

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know World War
II and the Foo Fighters

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and all the activities and
shutting down and even turning

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:90%
on our nuclear weapons.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that whoever may
be out there watching humanity

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.577 align:middle line:84%
is keeping a close eye on
our military and our weapons.

00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A very close eye.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Dulce in New Mexico
seems to have

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:90%
a lot of episodes happening.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.210 align:middle line:84%
On Gaia's "Deep
Space" program, they

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
talk about the military
base and the sky

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:90%
filled with UFO activity.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.610 align:middle line:10%

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: There have been
whispers since the early 1960s

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
that the US government and
military have been involved

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
with discovering caverns
hidden under the desert

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.150 align:middle line:90%
of the Southwest.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
They've also been active in
creating underground cities

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:90%
and bases.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the more
dramatic scenarios

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
involves an underground base
near the town of Dulce, New

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Mexico.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
The first base came
into prominence

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:84%
when UFO researcher,
Paul Bennewitz,

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.733 align:middle line:84%
accidentally discovered it,
but who was Paul Bennewitz?

00:19:55.733 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN:
So Paul Bennewitz

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:10%
was a US private scientist
who had a small defense

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:10%
company of his own, and he
did contract work for the US

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:10%
military in the 1970s.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Paul Bennewitz lived right
across from Kirtland Air Force

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:84%
base in New Mexico and in
the mid to late 1970s started

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:90%
to detect--

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:84%
he had very sophisticated
instrumentation

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
at his home to detect
what he believed

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:84%
were UFOs over
Kirtland and Manzano

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.920 align:middle line:84%
as well, the weapons
storage area nearby there.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Detect different types
of communications

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:84%
signals that he believed
he had translated.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have
translations of those.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he became
convinced that there

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:84%
was serious UFO and basically
extraterrestrial activity

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:84%
over Kirtland and Manzano
the weapons storage facility,

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%
where there was a ton of nukes.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NICK REDFERN: And Bennewitz
had an interest in UFOs,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:10%
and this was expanded
upon by the fact

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:10%
that he started to see in
the skies over Kirtland

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:10%
these strange objects performing
all sorts of weird maneuvers.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the equipment
that the Thunder company

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.890 align:middle line:84%
was picking up these
unusual, unexplained noises,

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:84%
which seem to be some
sort of coded message.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And Bennewitz came
to believe that what

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.220 align:middle line:84%
he was seeing in the sky
were definitive UFOs,

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.420 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial spacecraft,
and that these coded messages he

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.450 align:middle line:84%
was picking up were
covert messages

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:32.010 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrial craft to
other extraterrestrial craft,

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and he began to dig into
this issue very, very deeply.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GREG BISHOP: Paul Bennewitz
lived in Albuquerque

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
next to Kirtland Air
Force base, which

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
was and is a center of
a lot of secret weapons

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and weapons systems
and aircraft research.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:10%
And so he was
uniquely positioned

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:10%
to see what was
going on in the base

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:10%
because he lived on a hill--

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:10%
his house is still there--

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.030 align:middle line:10%
overlooking the entire base.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And he could see things,
especially late at night

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
when they were doing
testing, and they

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
didn't figure anybody
was up at that hour,

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:90%
but Paul Bennewitz was.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, absolutely
riveting, isn't it?

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: It is,
and it really makes

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:10%
me wonder about these homes and
bangs and sounds underground.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I would
pull up Google Earth

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and look where Stapleton
Airport and DIA and all

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:84%
the military bases
are, could they

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:84%
have been digging and
tunneling under there?

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a question I've always
had, and I wonder about that.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much does the
government know and they just

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:90%
aren't telling us?

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: A lot, and I
also find it fascinating

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that we had the Navy
come out and be pretty

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
upfront in public,
maybe not their choice,

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:90%
but it happened that way.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
Tic Tac videos.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: With the Tic Tac--

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But the Air Force has remained
pretty quiet and hush-hush

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And I believe personally that
it has to do with liability.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I've come to believe through
my 10 years of research

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force was out there
maybe doing some black access

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And if they did have their hand
in these mutilations and what,

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:84%
they have a lot
to cover up still,

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to answer for them.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like MK-ULTRA?

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, there's
actually a note in Dr.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Leo Sprinkle's files
that there was a Warren--

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and his last name
was redacted out--

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:90%
was at the ranch property.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And it says, something
took over his mind, made

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:84%
him walk towards the
woods, would release him,

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and he would run back
to the ranch house,

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and that this did this
to him five times.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.780 align:middle line:84%
That speaks to me as some
sort of mind control.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So who knows, there could
have been some black access

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:90%
projects happening out there.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what they
were experimenting with?

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could they
be related to UFO cases?

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, I think if there
were two beings seen out there

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
on that ranch property, if ETs
had their hand in mutilating

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:90%
cattle, if--

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:90%
who knows.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
The military obviously
would be interested

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.500 align:middle line:84%
in what they're
doing there and why.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: So I think they were
out there looking for answers.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There were a couple
interceptors pursuing a UFO.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about what
you know about that.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, I mentioned
that a little earlier

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that I FOIA'ed the
Kirkland Air Force Base

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:90%
and got the documents on that.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I can tell
you, I flew to Florida

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and did an interview
with the undersheriff

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:84%
there in Elbert County
and Kiowa at the time

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:84%
was a gentleman
named Bill Waugh.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he
does an appearance

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.210 align:middle line:84%
in Linda Moulton Howe's
movie, "A Strange Harvest."

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I went and interviewed--

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.948 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One of her classics.

00:24:33.948 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, his
son and his widow,

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and him and George Yarnell,
they were up in small planes

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.765 align:middle line:84%
looking for craft and looking
for these mutilators that

00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:44.890 align:middle line:90%
were mutilating the cattle.

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.307 align:middle line:84%
And something that
a lot of people

00:24:46.307 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:84%
don't really realize
and understand,

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.770 align:middle line:90%
people were very frightened.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
These were happening
almost daily.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So people had loaded
shotguns by their door.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:90%
They had--

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.248 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were that scared.

00:24:57.248 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: They were that scared.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:90%
It was a really eerie time.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:10%
And there was a $10,000
reward to find the people that

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.851 align:middle line:10%
were mutilating these cattle.

00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, people were actively
looking up in airplanes.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:84%
The Colorado Bureau
of Investigations

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:84%
was very aware of
what was happening,

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.910 align:middle line:84%
as was Stapleton Airport, so
they were watching the skies.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, one of the
documents that I uncovered also

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.550 align:middle line:84%
was that the Elbert
County sheriffs,

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:84%
they had a no-fly zone over
the county for a little while

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
as they were trying
to find out who

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:90%
were mutilating these cattle.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, one of the
theories was possibly cults.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.915 align:middle line:84%
But I think we can
safely rule that out.

00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:42.623 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Is
Bill Wash still alive?

00:25:42.623 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: No, he's not.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, we lost him.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but I'll tell you, his
widow, Jean, and his son,

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:84%
they certainly have
a lot of memories

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of really
good information.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So I was very fortunate to be
able to interview them as well

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.100 align:middle line:90%
as other people in the town.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Because really, what I thought
was isolated to the one ranch

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.790 align:middle line:84%
location-- and the ranch sits at
the highest elevation of Elbert

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:90%
County or in Kiowa--

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.390 align:middle line:84%
but this affected, I have
a list of over 250 people

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:90%
that had experienced things.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.543 align:middle line:84%
So this just wasn't isolated
to the ranch property.

00:26:15.543 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:84%
It was the whole
county, the whole town.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.377 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible
that some of these sightings

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
may have been originating
from something underground,

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:90%
like an ET base?

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I think that's
altogether, possible.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I really do because of just,
all the strange sounds and bangs

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and things coming
from underground.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows?

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's always
the possibility

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
of inter-dimensional portal
type things, as well.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's talk
about the possibility

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:84%
of cattle mutilations, what
else may be going on there.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Here's another clip from
Gaia's "Deep Space."

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.215 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:26:45.215 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NICK REDFERN: In
Northern New Mexico,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:10%
animals are being found drained
of blood with organs removed.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Black helicopters were seen
flying around the area,

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:90%
strange lights, UFOs.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And it all revolved
around this huge mesa

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:84%
which overlooks Dulce,
called the Archuleta Mesa.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.300 align:middle line:84%
One of the intriguing
theories is

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.930 align:middle line:84%
that there exists within
and below this huge mesa,

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
some sort of fortified
alien installation.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.930 align:middle line:84%
An extraterrestrial
base, if you like.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And certainly since
the 1970s right

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
through to the present
day, a lot of research

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:84%
has been done into
the Dulce area

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:84%
to try and answer that
question, are extraterrestrials

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.568 align:middle line:84%
living under New Mexico
in the Dulce area?

00:27:32.568 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:10%
>>ANTHONY SANCHEZ:
Yeah, back in the 1950s,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.400 align:middle line:10%
in Farmington,
there was an armada

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:10%
of UFOs seen going
from Farmington

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:10%
eastward towards Dulce.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Terrified everybody.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Made the newspapers
and then nothing.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REDFERN: In today's
world, a lot of nations

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:84%
do have underground
installations.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:10%
And it makes a great deal of
sense because if, God forbid,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:10%
there was ever a
nuclear war, then

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:10%
if some sort of containment
of our government

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.920 align:middle line:10%
is going to take place
and continuation,

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:10%
then the best place to be in a
Third World War is underground.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:10%
It makes sense.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.090 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of these
installations were

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.310 align:middle line:10%
built during the
height of the Cold War

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:10%
to protect the government while,
unfortunately, the rest of us

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:10%
are left upstairs to fry.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:10%
And one of the theories is that
some of these installations

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.440 align:middle line:10%
may have been built
for potentials

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:10%
in the event of a
Third World War,

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:10%
but over time, they may
have been reorganized

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:10%
and transformed
to where you have

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:10%
these alien-human
interactions going on.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:10%
In other words, very
much like Dulce.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SANCHEZ: We had
people coming forward

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:84%
finally sharing UFO
sightings, engagements

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.470 align:middle line:84%
with cryptids, creatures
they could not explain.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:54.010 align:middle line:84%
For the first time on
record, multiple families

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:58.300 align:middle line:84%
independent of one another
said, they hear traffic

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.980 align:middle line:90%
beneath their town.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Traffic traffic like
cars and trucks.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.293 align:middle line:84%
They hear, like, what
sounds like a train system.

00:29:05.293 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And we all know about
the Maglev tunnel system

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:90%
that supposedly exists there.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:84%
There is one that exists within
the Los Alamos infrastructure.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:84%
There's an underground
Maglev system.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This
underground system,

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.655 align:middle line:84%
Katie, could it be
ours or the ETs?

00:29:20.655 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I think,
most likely, it

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:90%
would be ours, if that exists.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I think with NORAD
base being right there,

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the likelihood
is probably,

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:90%
pretty high that some tunnel--

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.885 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: --system--
yeah-- they go somewhere.

00:29:34.885 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, did they go
through Elbert County?

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but, I
mean, that is certainly,

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:90%
a question that I have.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you still hearing
things about underground bases

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and reports like that?

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: From time
to time, you'll

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:84%
hear in the UFO
circles, people talking

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.150 align:middle line:90%
about these underground bases.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, people will ask
me, is the activity still high

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:90%
there in Elbert County?

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And do we still get
reports from ranchers

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.150 align:middle line:90%
of mutilations and that?

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, a
lot of these ranchers

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:84%
don't report these
things to MUFON.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.677 align:middle line:90%
It's been going on for so long.

00:30:11.677 --> 00:30:12.760 align:middle line:90%
They know nothing happens.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.885 align:middle line:90%
They don't want the stigma.

00:30:13.885 --> 00:30:15.910 align:middle line:10%
So yes, mutilations
are still occurring,

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:10%
just not to the
degree they were then.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting,
we just recently

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:84%
made contact with the
people living there now,

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and they are still seeing
some activity from time

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to time of different
orbs and lights

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:84%
flying on and off the
property and a sensation.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
interesting to me

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
personally because one
thing that I remember

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.710 align:middle line:84%
more than anything else is
that sense of being watched

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.363 align:middle line:84%
or monitored, and they're still
feeling that there, as well.

00:30:44.363 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's
kind of interesting.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:84%
In the past, Katie, we used to
have reports of scorched Earth.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.300 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
circle, for example.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:58.780 align:middle line:84%
We would see scorches of what
looked like a burned-out UFO

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.280 align:middle line:90%
that had landed.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't get those anymore.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, not so much.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:04.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.610 align:middle line:84%
That's something that fascinated
me going through the MUFON

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:84%
archives and doing the research
on the history that I have.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.610 align:middle line:84%
It seems as though,
the phenomenon

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:16.120 align:middle line:84%
tends to shift and change
through the decades.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if that
is popular culture or if--

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.170 align:middle line:84%
it seemed like we had more
landings and more actual

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.933 align:middle line:84%
sightings of beings
in the '70s--

00:31:24.933 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And more
abductions, too.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.142 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: --and more
abductions in the '70s.

00:31:28.142 --> 00:31:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 1975, we
have Travis Walton.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great story.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I don't know if,
maybe, during that decade,

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:84%
they were really gathering
evidence and ground soils

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and cattle and they were landing
more and now they have that

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and they don't need
to do that anymore

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:84%
so now they're doing flybys
and coming in and out

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.660 align:middle line:90%
of our oceans.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the answer to that

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:56.843 align:middle line:84%
is, but you can definitely
see these changes of the--

00:31:56.843 --> 00:31:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they've
been dramatic, too.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, they
really have been.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And even back to
the mutilations for a moment,

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.045 align:middle line:90%
they've slowed down a lot.

00:32:04.045 --> 00:32:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, they have.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
there's a lot of people

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.860 align:middle line:84%
believe that that's
kind of a closed case,

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.290 align:middle line:84%
it was all done by
the military, and it

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.580 align:middle line:90%
had no ET connection to it.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But the interviews
that I've done,

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.830 align:middle line:90%
I can't say that I believe that.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And one in particular, if
you go to the Elbert County

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Museum, one of
the families there

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that basically, pioneered-- one
of the early pioneers of Kiowa

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and Elbert County, I interviewed
one of the daughters--

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:90%
the granddaughters.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And she right out
of high school moved

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.280 align:middle line:84%
to the town of Ramah, Colorado,
which is really close to Kiowa,

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and they lived on several acres
miles off the county road.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:52.697 align:middle line:84%
And her husband was on horseback
checking the cows for calves.

00:32:52.697 --> 00:32:53.497 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:32:53.497 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, and he came
across a dead calf and it had

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:90%
a--

00:32:58.650 --> 00:32:59.775 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect incisions.

00:32:59.775 --> 00:33:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: --perfect
incision of a square--

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.150 align:middle line:90%
cut, cut, cut, cut.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:84%
The top of the fur was removed,
but the skin was still there.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
are laser incisions.

00:33:07.325 --> 00:33:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Yes, well,
this was, like, cut.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So he gets on the horse, goes
back and, gets my witness,

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and they come back 20, 25
minutes later in the pickup

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:90%
truck.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.760 align:middle line:84%
When they got back, that
calf was completely mutilated

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
with precision laser
cut, just like you hear.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No blood.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Blood drained,
organs removed.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And there were no tracks
other than the horse

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.513 align:middle line:90%
what the horse had made.

00:33:28.513 --> 00:33:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were miles
off the county road.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:90%
No helicopter sounds.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:33.780 align:middle line:90%
They said they felt watched.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:84%
They felt, it was really
eerie and almost evil.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And it really scared them.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that can't be
the military doing that.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the movie "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,"

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:84%
they portrayed those
kinds of scenes

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.855 align:middle line:84%
as government-run doing
tests, like chemical

00:33:51.855 --> 00:33:55.650 align:middle line:84%
tests, biological
tests, on these cattle.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:57.195 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
they had to dissect

00:33:57.195 --> 00:34:00.510 align:middle line:84%
them to look at the organs
to see what kind of effect

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.500 align:middle line:84%
it would be because it
would affect us, too.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Right.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not
sure that's the case.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:06.303 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: No, not in all of them.

00:34:06.303 --> 00:34:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, a large percentage
possibly that's true.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They're taking the tongue,
the eye, the sensitive organs

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:15.510 align:middle line:84%
looking for mad cow disease
or different genetic testing--

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could this
biological affect this animal?

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:18.898 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:18.898 --> 00:34:20.699 align:middle line:84%
But certainly,
through the interviews

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:84%
that I've personally done, it
doesn't answer for all of them.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.969 align:middle line:84%
So I do think there's, maybe,
an ET connection to some

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:28.199 align:middle line:90%
of the mutilations.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is, what is
called, the hitchhiker effect?

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.164 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:34:33.164 --> 00:34:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, interestingly,
at the very beginning,

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.710 align:middle line:84%
I told you I kind of started my
journey on the paranormal side

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.909 align:middle line:84%
because I experienced
some very unusual things.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:84%
And I compartmentalized them
and didn't really connect it

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:51.120 align:middle line:84%
to the activity on
the ranch until I

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.750 align:middle line:84%
read the book "Skin Walkers at
the Pentagon" just recently.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about
the hitchhiker effect.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And back at my ranch
house, the night

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that I spoke about where we
had that loud disembodied voice

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:90%
threatening us and that.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:84%
When I got home to my
house that evening,

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I walked in the front door
and collapsed in the doorway,

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and I was paralyzed
for a short while.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:12.202 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're kidding me?

00:35:12.202 --> 00:35:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: And I couldn't speak.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that night
was the first night

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I had my full-blown
major migraine headache.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I suffered migraine
headaches, like, weekly

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.970 align:middle line:90%
after that event on the ranch.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:25.785 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was somebody
bombarding you?

00:35:25.785 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I don't know,
but at that time, also,

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.290 align:middle line:90%
I never slept it alone.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:30.782 align:middle line:84%
I always slept
with my big sister.

00:35:30.782 --> 00:35:32.490 align:middle line:84%
We put the bed against
the wall because I

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:84%
was seeing these large
shadow-type figures in my room.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:38.940 align:middle line:84%
They would be by the closet,
peeking around the door,

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:90%
next to my bed.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.060 align:middle line:90%
I was terrified all the time.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I was always afraid
of being taken.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.420 align:middle line:90%
I walked to school--

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:84%
my elementary school--
and I was so afraid

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.750 align:middle line:84%
that if a car, and especially
motorcycles was really bad,

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.868 align:middle line:84%
I would pretend as if
I lived at that house

00:35:53.868 --> 00:35:55.410 align:middle line:84%
because I always
thought somebody was

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:56.980 align:middle line:90%
going to take me or something.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So I was terrified
all those years,

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.610 align:middle line:84%
but I never really connected
the paranormal things that

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.000 align:middle line:84%
happened-- the shadow figures
and I had an experience with

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.730 align:middle line:90%
this big blue orb--

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I never connected it to the
ranch until just recently,

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.700 align:middle line:84%
when other people said
when they spend time

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.260 align:middle line:84%
at these high
strangeness locations,

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.170 align:middle line:84%
these phenomena
tend to follow them.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's certainly true in
my case throughout my life.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It might
not be UFO-related.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.327 align:middle line:84%
It could be something
entirely different.

00:36:25.327 --> 00:36:26.145 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Maybe.

00:36:26.145 --> 00:36:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what it is,
but it certainly has--

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:32.700 align:middle line:84%
some things connected
to me in that sense

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.740 align:middle line:84%
because it continues
to this day.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think there's
a connection between UFOs

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.587 align:middle line:84%
and what's been happening
to you and other people?

00:36:41.587 --> 00:36:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I do.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I've just talked
to so many people

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that have experienced the same
thing, very similar things.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe
that it's connected.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think it's all
based on this ranch or is it

00:36:52.795 --> 00:36:53.595 align:middle line:90%
just--

00:36:53.595 --> 00:36:55.053 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: No, I
think there's areas,

00:36:55.053 --> 00:36:56.790 align:middle line:84%
not only across
the United States,

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.700 align:middle line:84%
but around the world that
have these high degree

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:84%
of high strangeness
activity that happens.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in the Mars
program and in the data,

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:10.410 align:middle line:84%
I found another location that
had very similar experiences

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.600 align:middle line:84%
as the ranch in
Colorado called--

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
it was called the
Ohiopyle Creature

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Case in Ohiopyle, Pennsylvania.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Very similar things
around that same time.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And so what I started
to do is I was looking

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.310 align:middle line:84%
at the magnetic map of the
United States to see what,

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.376 align:middle line:84%
maybe, these locations
had in common--

00:37:29.376 --> 00:37:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Blind Frog and Skinwalker
and Marley Woods

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.690 align:middle line:90%
and all these locations.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And one thing they
all have in common

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:84%
is they ping the
charts of being very,

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:90%
very highly magnetic areas.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So I found that
really interesting.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if there's
something that's attracting ETs

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to these really
high magnetic areas

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.280 align:middle line:84%
or if it allows us to
interact with the phenomenon

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:90%
something in our brain.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's going
on at the ranch now?

00:37:54.157 --> 00:37:57.315 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, the
family has said

00:37:57.315 --> 00:38:01.710 align:middle line:84%
the activity is much less than
it was back in those years,

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:05.110 align:middle line:84%
but they are still experiencing
some things from time to time.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.870 align:middle line:90%
And as fate would have it--

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.923 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they scared?

00:38:08.923 --> 00:38:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I don't know
if they're scared.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I think they feel
watched, and I think

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.970 align:middle line:84%
they have an uneasiness
or uneasy feeling,

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:18.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's not to the degree
it was back at the day.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the whole
town is on edge anymore,

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.590 align:middle line:90%
like it used to be.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.627 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they feel violated?

00:38:25.627 --> 00:38:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I'm not
sure about that.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:32.552 align:middle line:84%
Does the government continue
to come out to the ranch?

00:38:32.552 --> 00:38:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Not to my knowledge.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: No, but I do know that
they're-- like, for example,

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.730 align:middle line:84%
when I sent in my FOIA request,
I did get a personal phone call

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:42.560 align:middle line:84%
from the United
States Air Force.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And they basically told me, if
you want any more information

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:48.245 align:middle line:84%
about that area to
contact them directly.

00:38:48.245 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I argue a lot
with Stephen Bassett--

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.340 align:middle line:84%
you know Stephen-- who talks
about disclosure all the time.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.440 align:middle line:90%
He says, it's coming.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:90%
It's coming.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.170 align:middle line:84%
He's been saying
that for 15 years.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I keep telling
him, Steve, it's

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.155 align:middle line:84%
not coming unless
whistleblowers come forward--

00:39:01.155 --> 00:39:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: That's true.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.947 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and really
get the information out.

00:39:03.947 --> 00:39:04.970 align:middle line:90%
What's your guess?

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.553 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: I agree
with you on that one.

00:39:06.553 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I think there's
too much liability and too

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:84%
many secrets for all these years
that they're just not going

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.980 align:middle line:84%
to come and spill
it all one day.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come out
slowly through time

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.525 align:middle line:90%
until a lot of these--

00:39:18.525 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to
call them victims--

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:23.780 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of these people
that were traumatized

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.930 align:middle line:84%
or part of these programs
are long dead and gone,

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:28.550 align:middle line:90%
then maybe it'll come out.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem
to be concerned

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.600 align:middle line:84%
that because of holding
back information on us

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.080 align:middle line:84%
for so many years that
to come forward and say

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.030 align:middle line:84%
this has been happening, they
don't know how to say it.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.385 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what to do.

00:39:43.385 --> 00:39:44.185 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Right.

00:39:44.185 --> 00:39:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I think they don't
have answers just

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.420 align:middle line:90%
like we don't have answers.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
the general public

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.745 align:middle line:84%
to know how vulnerable
we might be.

00:39:52.745 --> 00:39:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they can't control
what ETs are out there doing

00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:01.570 align:middle line:84%
or who's flying around in our
airspace, that's kind of scary.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Erica Lukes is the
MUFON State Director in Utah,

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and she talked about the
possibility of full disclosure.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.040 align:middle line:90%
We need a great sighting.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.560 align:middle line:10%
We need a great national
sighting of something landing

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:10%
to get people excited
again about this.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Right.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have--

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the
Phoenix Lights case.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1997

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: --in '97.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.540 align:middle line:84%
That was such a great
case and yet, still you

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.880 align:middle line:90%
have people arguing about it.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah,
that they were flares.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.253 align:middle line:90%
That they were Chinese lanterns.

00:40:34.253 --> 00:40:35.053 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: Right.

00:40:35.053 --> 00:40:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That there
were military jets.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LUKES: I know.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You get all these
people seeing an object, which

00:40:40.755 --> 00:40:43.802 align:middle line:90%
was about a mile long.

00:40:43.802 --> 00:40:45.257 align:middle line:84%
>>LUKES: It's
interesting, and you

00:40:45.257 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:84%
know, because you deal with so
many peoples' belief systems.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:54.294 align:middle line:84%
And we have to try to
separate this from a belief

00:40:54.294 --> 00:40:56.950 align:middle line:90%
to a factual thing.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Here is the data.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.800 align:middle line:84%
You cannot look at all of the
government documents that have

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.920 align:middle line:84%
been obtained, you can't look at
all of the scientific evidence

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.720 align:middle line:90%
in places,

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.130 align:middle line:84%
like Hessdalen, over in Norway,
30 years of data over there.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.290 align:middle line:84%
They've identified
four different types

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:84%
of light phenomena that
responds intelligently.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.110 align:middle line:90%
So you can't argue about that.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get
some good people out

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.800 align:middle line:84%
there in front that are
professional that can lead

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.050 align:middle line:90%
the way and say, look at this.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.370 align:middle line:90%
This isn't a belief.

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:31.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a fact.

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, what
continues to drive you?

00:41:34.885 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I want answers.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.900 align:middle line:90%
I love researching.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.960 align:middle line:10%
My happy place is
to go into archives.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.090 align:middle line:10%
I really just want
to get to the bottom

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:44.920 align:middle line:10%
of what was happening there.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.900 align:middle line:90%
And that drives me every day.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It keeps me going
to keep digging.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And I have just run across so
many really interesting people

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:84%
along the way that have just
little pieces of information,

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's sort of like
this just big puzzle word.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.823 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to put
all those pieces in place

00:42:02.823 --> 00:42:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and get to the bottom of
really, what was happening.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know
curiosity killed the cat.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I know.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Be careful.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I know.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:90%
That's so true.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where can people
find your work and track you?

00:42:13.975 --> 00:42:18.068 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: Yes, they can
go to katiepaige.net.

00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And spell Paige for us

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.360 align:middle line:10%
>>PAIGE: P-A-I-G-E.net.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.215 align:middle line:84%
And that's my website, and
they can contact me there.

00:42:25.215 --> 00:42:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going to
continue researching this

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and stay a state director
for MUFON, for example?

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: I am.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:31.620 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have another love, too,
which was a Roswell-Denver body

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.255 align:middle line:84%
connection so I've
been investigating

00:42:37.255 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:90%
this for three years.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And COVID kind of slowed
that down a little bit,

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.860 align:middle line:84%
but I'm working on
that case, as well.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.260 align:middle line:84%
There was a Brigadier
General Arthur Exon

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.510 align:middle line:84%
who rumored that one
of the Roswell bodies

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.820 align:middle line:84%
ended up in a mortuary
outfit in Denver.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've been on that
case for a while, as well.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've uncovered from some
interesting things on that.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does your gut
tell you about all of this?

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: My gut-- where
I stand right now,

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.560 align:middle line:90%
I believe that it's--

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all looking
for simple answers,

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:13.750 align:middle line:84%
that Occam's razor, and
it's not a simple answer.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I think we had military
in there doing things

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and we had unusual unknown
phenomenon happening

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.710 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, and
it just gets convoluted.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So the simple answers
that we're looking

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.610 align:middle line:90%
for, we're not going to find.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's
way more complex.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And even getting down to the
what reality actually is.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can go deep,
deep into that, But--

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Katie, why
aren't we helped

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.080 align:middle line:90%
by the occupants of these UFOs?

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.882 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, I ask
that almost every day.

00:43:42.882 --> 00:43:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, come on, we need
some help already.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there were to
some agreements put in place.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, there's a universal
you can't interact.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.860 align:middle line:84%
There has to be something like
that because you would think,

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.660 align:middle line:90%
one of the--

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there has to
be multiple beings that

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.070 align:middle line:90%
are interacting, possibly.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.770 align:middle line:84%
You would think some of them
would want to just come up

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.600 align:middle line:90%
and say, hello, we're here.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good question.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, keep
doing what you're doing.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PAIGE: Thank you.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PAIGE: Well, thank
you for having me.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.900 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure being here.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: UFOs, will we
ever get full disclosure

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.870 align:middle line:90%
from the government?

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:23.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure, and experts like
Katie Paige, they're not sure,

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.090 align:middle line:10%
but we're not going
to stop trying.

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:26.980 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
