>>We are in the
midst of what appears

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.517 align:middle line:84%
to be a colossal and
history-making blackout.

to take in as much information

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:90%

>>In 2003, a massive
blackout struck major areas

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
of the US and Canada and was
perceived as a wake-up call

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
for the nation.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>We've got a real
crisis in our grid,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and this is why, despite
being a super power,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:84%
we have a grid that is
comparable to a third-world

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:90%
country, and that's not right.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: So
you just saw that.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:10%
What a horrible situation that
occurred in August of 2003.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.930 align:middle line:84%
More than 50 million
Americans and in Canada

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
were struck by the
power grid going down.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
It was just an
unbelievable situation.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:90%
And it could get worse.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest on "Beyond
Belief" is Bob Akart.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Bob has written several books.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
One is, of course, "EMP,"
which we'll tell you about.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:90%
The other is "Cyber Warfare."

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a third
attack that could hit us,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and that comes
from God, the sun.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a
look at Bob's profile.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Imagine an end to
life as you know it.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Society is collapsing, and
life-threatening dangers

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:90%
are all around you.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
For doomsday
prepper Bobby Akart,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:90%
this is not science fiction.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of life.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Bobby theorizes
true-to-life scenarios

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that would follow
catastrophic events,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.800 align:middle line:84%
like economic collapse,
a breakdown of society,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:90%
and cyber warfare.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
He's a five-time number-one
Amazon best-selling author

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
of two series, the nonfiction
"Prepping for Tomorrow,"

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and the post-apocalyptic
fiction "Boston Brahmin."

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Bobby and his wife live a life
of sustainable preparedness

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
in the woods of
the Appalachians.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.214 align:middle line:84%
And he has tips that one
day may just save your life.

00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, there you go.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.876 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
introduce you, Bob.

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOBBY AKART:
Thank you, George.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Welcome.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Good to talk to you again.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Well, thank you
very much for having me on.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By the way, you
did a great job for us

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
on the "Coast to
Coast" radio show.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.127 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: That was very fun.

00:02:43.127 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the fastest two
hours of my life.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest with you.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this is going
to be a fast hour for you, too.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you that this is
a subject that, as you know,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:90%
is so dear to my heart.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I have been watching
this, monitoring

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:84%
this story and the possibility
of what could happen

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:90%
to our grid for years now.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get it fixed.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:10%
>>AKART: Yes, and it's
really unfathomable

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:10%
that people have not
taken this more seriously.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:10%
The EMP Commission, which I
know you are very familiar with,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:10%
started to, as I say,
ring the clarion bell

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:10%
about the threat of EMP, both
man-made and, as you mentioned,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:10%
God-create from a solar flare.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Our country is so
dependent upon electricity

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and the small circuitry
involving our telephones

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.150 align:middle line:90%
and our computers.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
massive pulses of energy

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
that would take
every bit of that

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and fry it and send
us back to the 1800s.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And the resulting societal
collapse of an event like that

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:90%
is unimaginable.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
In my fiction series,
as was mentioned,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I tried to imagine that,
because sometimes I

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
think the reader
would have the ability

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
to visualize through the works
of fiction what could truly

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.126 align:middle line:84%
happen in a nonfiction
reality world.

00:04:03.126 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm not
sure people, Bob, really

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
understand the
significance of what

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
happens when the power grid
goes down for any unusually

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:90%
large amount of time.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so in the winter time if
you lose power for a few hours,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
it's inconvenient and you
question it and you get upset,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:90%
but it comes back on.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.044 align:middle line:84%
It's not coming back on
with this right away.

00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: That's right.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:10%
And everyone's experience
that, as you know,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:10%
a lightning storm
or a snowstorm.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Something has caused their
power to go out at some point.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:90%
But they know it's coming back.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.290 align:middle line:90%
It always does.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But in the event of an EMP,
whether from a solar flare

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
or a nuclear-delivered
weapon, or in the case of new

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:90%
technology--

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A cyber attack.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: A cyber attack
that's coordinated,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
the grid can be taken
down, and it may not

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:90%
come back for many years.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a
society that folks

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
are used to having everything at
their fingertips-- the grocery

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:84%
stores, what they call
just-in-time inventory

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
operations, where there's only
enough food in a grocery store

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:84%
shelf to last two or three
days at any given time.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.366 align:middle line:84%
And then the run hits,
and they're done.

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: When the
run hits, it's done.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
misconceptions, I believe,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and you read and
hear this often,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is that for the first
72 hours or so, people

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
will come together and
coalesce around each other

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:90%
to protect each other.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot in the news
where at the drop of a hat,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.357 align:middle line:90%
society collapses.

00:05:30.357 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.106 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: It could be
that your favorite sports

00:05:33.106 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:84%
team won the Super Bowl, and
then they go loot and riot.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Or if they lose,
they do the same.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if the
power grid goes out,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and everyone knows the
power is not coming back

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:90%
for a significant time.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.379 align:middle line:84%
I think society will
collapse quickly.

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:84%
There's an old twilight zone
episode called "The Shelter."

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And this was during
the Cold War.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And this fellow built a fallout
shelter, a bomb shelter,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:90%
for his family.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, the neighborhood
knew about it,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:84%
but everybody laughed at
it, until one day they

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
had an alarm that we were
being attacked by the Soviets.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And everybody wanted to
get into his shelter.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
He had enough food in there
to last for his family,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
but people are trying to
smash down his house door.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
The neighborhood went
absolutely crazy.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And in the fitting
way of Rod Serling,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
it turned out to
be a false alarm.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And people started walking
away back to their homes.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But it showed the
reality of what

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:84%
people will do when they're put
under that kind of pressure.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
would happen here.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>It happens so
fast, in my opinion.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
these events-- I

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:90%
call them collapse events.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a cyber
attack or a solar flare,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:90%
EMP, even economic collapse.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
When these collapse
events occur,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
it's not the event itself that
causes the pain to humans,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:84%
whether it be in
starvation or death.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the way we react to each
other under that pressure.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And what I have hoped to
do with my series of books

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:84%
is to not only entertain
but inform and then take it

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:90%
to one additional level.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Identify the threats
that we face as a country

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
so they can make an informed
decision if it's realistic.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Then instruct them on what they
can do to survive until order

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:90%
is restored.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If order is restored.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>If order is restored.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not,
then they will be

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
able to live that life
of the 1800s, which is

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.630 align:middle line:90%
sustainable through gardening.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And you may not have
TV and electricity,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:90%
but you can certainly survive.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.884 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be able
to adopt that mindset.

00:07:45.884 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Bob,
not everybody is

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.924 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
sustain themselves.

00:07:48.924 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you have
a farm, you might

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
be able to get by
for a little bit.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you live in the city,
you don't have a backyard,

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be able
to grow enough food to sustain

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.780 align:middle line:90%
yourself for a long time.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
committees have projected

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
90% of the American public-- 90%
of 300 million people; that's

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:84%
270 million people-- will
be dead within one year

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.534 align:middle line:84%
if there's a solar flare, a
cyber attack, or an EMP attack.

00:08:19.534 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: That's right.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're referring to
the EMP Commission, which

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
did extensive research,
called on the brightest

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
minds, the best of the best
from the scientific community,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
as well as sociologists,
and said, what would

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:90%
happen in an event like this?

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:90%
And they issued a report.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And the sad thing is,
we never acted on it.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:84%
In typical government
fashion, they talked about it,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't take
the necessary steps.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And by not publicizing this more
and by taking these major cyber

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
events, which we've
experienced recently,

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and the threat of North
Korea, for example,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:84%
with an EMP attack,
and not making it

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
front-page news is doing
a disservice to Americans.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.771 align:middle line:90%
Why not be prepared?

00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:02.646 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:09:02.646 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:90%
It's insurance.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: It's insurance.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people pay insurance
for a tornado or a flood.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their car.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Never file a
claim their entire life.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
What's so bad about
having extra water

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and food and medical
supplies in your home just

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:90%
to ride out the storm?

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, to me
it's the right thing

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:84%
to do so you're not a
burden on first responders

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
who need to maybe care for
the elderly or children who

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:90%
need that help.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll be able
to sustain yourself

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
until order is restored,
if it is restored.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If it is restored.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about those possibilities.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are three
major possibilities.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
Bob Akart is also

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
one of several people
on this planet who

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:84%
are trying to wake up
everybody to tell them

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:90%
about these dangers.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:90%
There's William Forstchen.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:90%
There's F. Michael Maloof.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to throw myself in that
category, and Bob Akart, who--

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to tell
everybody about the dangers

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:84%
of a solar flare from the sun,
a cyber attack on the grid,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.160 align:middle line:84%
or an EMP, an Electronic
Magnetic Pulse attack that

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:90%
could take the grid system.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, we went out to
the streets to talk

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to people about these
issues to see if they even

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:90%
know what they are.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>It doesn't feel protected, no.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.391 align:middle line:84%
>>The power grid
is not protected.

00:10:23.391 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Depends on what we're
protecting them against.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.415 align:middle line:84%
But in general, not as much
as they should be protected.

00:10:30.415 --> 00:10:34.486 align:middle line:84%
>>Natural disasters can
totally cut out technology.

00:10:34.486 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, generally speaking, I
think the grid is fairly safe

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and that power outages
are relatively rare,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and they are fixed
relatively quickly.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't believe the power
grid is well protected, no.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've got
some Americans, Bob,

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.530 align:middle line:84%
who are somewhat
aware of this, maybe

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:84%
because we've been pounding away
at this for a couple of years.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd like to
do is talk about this

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:84%
in three different categories--
the solar flare, the EMP

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
attack, and that
is the detonation

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:84%
of a nuke high atop our
atmosphere that would have

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:84%
this trickle-down
effect, and then a cyber

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
attack, which we just
saw happen in the Ukraine

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:84%
when some employee working
at the power system willingly

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:84%
or otherwise opened
up an e-mail,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and a virus attacked and
shut down the power system.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk first of
all about solar flares.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1800s, we
had the Carrington Event.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And the Carrington Event, named
after Professor Carrington,

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
was a huge solar flare
that knocked out the only

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
electrical thing we had
going on at the time,

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and that was that
the telegraph system.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It fried railroad
ties and the metal.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.460 align:middle line:84%
If that flare were to
hit today, and we've

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:84%
dodged a couple of them,
it would shut the grid

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:90%
down for how long?

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Well, at the time
we were not a wired society.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the
types of interconnection

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:90%
that we have now.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But it was devastating, and
people's headsets all caught

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:90%
on fire.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had their
equipment catching on fire.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:84%
If that happened
today, if we got

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.669 align:middle line:84%
a direct hit of a
geomagnetic storm,

00:12:18.669 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:90%
those charged particles--

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An X-something.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Yes.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a range,
and it goes all the way up.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
When that geomagnetic
storm and those

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:84%
charged particles hit
our Earth's atmosphere,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere would
spread the particles out

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.964 align:middle line:84%
before they came and
actually struck Earth.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have an
atmosphere, it would just

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:90%
come down and hit one spot.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So that electromagnetic
pulse, naturally created,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:90%
would spread.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And everything with these
circuits, these small circuits,

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
including power
lines and anything

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
that's connected to
the grid, would not

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.350 align:middle line:84%
be able to absorb the
strength and the impact

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:90%
of those particles.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Your surge protectors
would not be sufficient.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.315 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a way to
protect your electronics.

00:13:04.315 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:90%
And we can talk about that.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is a
naturally occurring solar flare

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:90%
could do that to us.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And we dodged a bullet, as you
mentioned, a couple of summers

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.308 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It went out
the side of the sun.

00:13:16.308 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't facing us directly.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: We missed
it by about a week.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.672 align:middle line:84%
As our Earth's rotation
went around the sun--

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We lucked out.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: If the timing had been
just a little bit different,

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.460 align:middle line:84%
there would have
been nothing that we

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:84%
could have done about it, and we
would have taken a direct hit.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does it take
these particles to hit us,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:90%
a couple days?

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Well, it depends on
the strength and intensity.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, NASA has a
incredible satellite system

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:84%
that reports these
active regions.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:90%
The sun has holes.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you go-- in fact,
I have an app on my phone

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that warns me when an
active region is flaring up.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.411 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Oh, yeah.

00:13:52.411 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
When you fly a couple
thousand miles from home,

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:90%
you think about these things.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:57.910 align:middle line:90%
OK, bye, George.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm going home.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm on my way.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: These
flares are monitored.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
These active regions
are monitored.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And this plasma is
ejected from the sun.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And they can tell based
upon computer models

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:84%
if we're at risk of that
ejection hitting us,

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:90%
the coronal mass ejection.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.091 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and they
do let us know sometimes.

00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, through
the radio industry,

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:84%
we get told we've got
a flare coming our way.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It could be disruptive to
some kinds of communication.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:90%
But these are small.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:90%
These are M size or C size.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Or even maybe at an
X1, which is on the low end.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And you'll get warnings of GPS.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:84%
You may have recalled
years ago that there

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
was an issue with airline
traffic from England

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And they had to
reroute airline traffic

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:84%
because the geomagnetic
storm had dipped down so

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
low near Iceland
in areas that they

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:84%
were afraid it would disrupt
the navigation systems.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
The real question
is-- NASA will know

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:90%
if a major storm is coming.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And as we've
discussed, the question

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:84%
would be, will our
government inform us

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
that a major storm is coming
in fear that if they do,

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the society will
panic in advance or maybe

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle line:90%
unnecessarily.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Because these things
aren't 100% predictable.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They do
warn us to date.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I would think that
in the flare episode,

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.430 align:middle line:84%
they would probably
say something.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:84%
We have an X8
coming or whatever.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Prepare yourselves.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:90%
But here's the problem, Bob.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we get hit
with an X25 like Carrington.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Well--

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With an
uninsulated grid.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Yes.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.403 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing we can do.

00:15:39.403 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion,
what would happen

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
is that our
government would rally

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.991 align:middle line:84%
their different
mechanisms for protection.

00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For themselves, for
government to keep going.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Command and control
of the military, things

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.270 align:middle line:90%
like continuity of government.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: NORAD.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Yeah.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
would immediately

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
hunker down,
probably very quietly

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:84%
if they want to keep it
silent, with the hopes

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.700 align:middle line:84%
of being able to not
only protect the United

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
States in the aftermath,
but to try to help

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.760 align:middle line:90%
as many citizens as possible.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter
is, our government does not

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:17.710 align:middle line:84%
have enough stored food
rations, MREs, other means

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:90%
to take care of everybody.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the EMP
commission suggested

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
that if we have a prolonged
power outage, regardless

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
of the cause, up to 90%
of Americans could die.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the question becomes,
how quickly will that happen?

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.647 align:middle line:90%
They suggest within 12 months.

00:16:33.647 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:84%
We saw what happened when
Hurricane Katrina hit,

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:84%
how the Environmental
Protection Agency, how FEMA,

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that they were hopeless and
helpless to get anything done.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a disaster of mini
biblical proportions.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Magnify this around the country.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Well, Katrina
is a great example.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
You have stories in
the press-- and you

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:84%
mentioned Ukraine and others--
that the threat is real.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I've written books showing
people that the threat is real.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.632 align:middle line:84%
But whether they believe it for
themselves is another story.

00:17:09.632 --> 00:17:13.369 align:middle line:84%
When Katrina was coming, the
whole country saw it coming.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.709 align:middle line:84%
But yet, there were people
who decided to remain behind

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
they could ride it out

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.490 align:middle line:90%
or didn't take it serious.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't think it was
going to be as bad as it was.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.053 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: And it cost
them their lives,

00:17:22.053 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
or they were standing on
rooftops when the water was

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.980 align:middle line:90%
up to their gutters.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
you have to do

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.690 align:middle line:84%
is educate people, show them
that the threat is real.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
you have to do is

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:84%
convince them to
pay attention so

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that when that threat
is coming, they know

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:90%
how to react and deal with it.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's a two-pronged approach.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.170 align:middle line:84%
There's one thing
studying the science

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and talking about how it could
happen and give examples.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's another
step to show people

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.716 align:middle line:84%
how to be prepared
and get ready for it.

00:17:53.716 --> 00:17:54.757 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:17:54.757 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Ted Koppel is another one
who is trying to wake us up

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to these possibilities, a
cyber attack, which we'll

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:90%
get into in just a second here.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But with the sun, you
just can't control it.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And you just don't know
when, because it's not timed.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Well, at least from
history and as our knowledge

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:84%
base allows, we have never
had a solar flare that

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
could be as intense as
the type of EMP weapons

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that are available
to rogue nations,

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and there are several, the
bad actors in the world.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And the best hope with
a solar flare is A,

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
we will have notice,
and then B, hopefully it

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:84%
will not be as intense as
a nuclear-delivered EMP

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:90%
from whatever source.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have to have
hope that if people

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:84%
will take some minimal
steps to prepare,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
it just takes a
little bit of effort.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, now let's get
into some of your works,

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:84%
first of all, "Cyber Warfare,"
of course, by Bobby Akart.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Department of Defense
member Leon Panetta

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:08.340 align:middle line:84%
has been warning people for
years about this possibility

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:10%
>>US officials say a cyber
attack against Aramco,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:10%
the world's largest
oil producer,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.970 align:middle line:10%
has been traced to
hackers inside Iran,

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:10%
another volley in an
increasingly high stakes war

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:10%
going on in cyberspace.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:10%
And Defense Secretary
Panetta warns

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:10%
potential enemies,
including Iran,

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:10%
are developing the capability
to launch devastating attacks.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:10%
>>The collective result
of these kinds of attacks

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:10%
could be a cyber Pearl
Harbor, an attack that

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:10%
would cause physical
destruction and the loss

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:10%
of life, an attack that would
paralyze and shock the nation

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:10%
and create a new profound
sense of vulnerability.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Bobby, that
was three or four years ago

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:90%
he said that.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:84%
How much have we done
since he warned everybody?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Zilch.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: The best we can.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing, and he's
exactly right about likening it

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:90%
to at Pearl Harbor scenario.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But the difference with a
cyber attack, as I like to say,

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
is we won't know from
whom or from where,

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
but we'll certainly know when
we get hit with a cyber attack.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is it
could be an army, part

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
of the PLA in China who has a
whole division dedicated to--

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As we do.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: As do as,
and we've used them.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
The Russians have
used it as well.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:10%
Or it could be some snotty-nosed
kid in his mom's basement

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.230 align:middle line:10%
in his PJs--

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Who's smart.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: He's smart and
figures out a way to do it.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It's entirely possible.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.290 align:middle line:84%
An overused phrase, which I will
say, but it is very fitting,

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
it's not a matter
of if but when.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Because every
minute of every day,

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.410 align:middle line:84%
these hackers are conducting
penetration testing, or what

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:84%
they call pen testing,
looking for vulnerabilities

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:84%
in systems that
involve our utilities,

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.770 align:middle line:90%
our critical infrastructure.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
There's not a day
that goes by where

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:84%
you don't read about
a hack of a government

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.116 align:middle line:90%
agency or a major business.

00:21:13.116 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The IRS got
hit, and they just

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:84%
announced that it was more
extensive than they first

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:90%
reported.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Exactly.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And the public doesn't pay
attention to these things,

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
although it's in the news daily,
until it affects them directly.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, in order
to get action sometimes,

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
especially at the highest
levels of government,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to actually have the
public be directly affected.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
The problem with cyber
warfare and cyber attacks,

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
as well as EMP, is when we get
affected by devastating attacks

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:84%
like those, it will be
too late to do anything.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And the time to act is now.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And it can be done,
but in the event

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.434 align:middle line:84%
our government doesn't take
action, then we as individuals

00:21:59.434 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:90%
can do things as well.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, if they
don't take action,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:90%
there's something going on here.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:90%
There's something very strange.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, we saw what
happened in the Ukraine,

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:84%
where a hacker sent an
e-mail into the system,

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and some unwitting employee--
or maybe he was part of it,

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
who knows?-- opened up
the virus in the e-mail,

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and it attacked
the power system.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:90%
It shut them down.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Exactly.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.676 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it works.

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And computers all over the
world could be affected

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and you wouldn't even know it.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:84%
These sophisticated
attacks usually

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:90%
involve multiple approaches.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the Ukraine,
the first thing they did

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
is they attacked
the phone system.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.111 align:middle line:84%
They took out communications
within that area.

00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was planned.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: It all
planned, very tactical.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:90%
And the Russians are good.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is in many events
a precursor to war for Russia.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
When they attacked Estonia and
Georgia back in 2007, 2008,

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:84%
in that time frame, the
first thing they did

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
is they undermined those
nations through cyber attacks.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they conducted
the military drills.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Recently, after the plane
was shot down in Turkey--

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:90%
you're aware of that.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Russian plane.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: The
Russians then started

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:84%
attacking the Turkish
government and their critical

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure, trying
to find vulnerabilities,

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.800 align:middle line:84%
basically to teach
Turkey a lesson.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:84%
In recent days-- and
this is something

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
to watch-- the
Russians have massed

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:84%
significant numbers of
troops and military hardware

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.660 align:middle line:84%
into Armenia, which is a
bordering nation of Turkey.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
If you start to see cyber
attacks in the news picking up

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:84%
that Turkey is
reporting, then there

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.790 align:middle line:84%
could be something bigger on
the horizon in the Middle East.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How easy is it,
Bob, to get into the system

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.150 align:middle line:90%
to shut down the grid?

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Well, what
a hacker is looking

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.340 align:middle line:84%
for is what I call
a vulnerability,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and many know those as
zero day vulnerabilities,

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:59.860 align:middle line:84%
meaning that they are constantly
looking for a system flaw.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And then once they
find that flaw,

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:84%
they exploit it by inserting
malware or a virus, as you say,

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:84%
before the IT professionals
on the other end

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
can find a way to
protect their system.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So hundreds of thousands
of people around the world

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:90%
are using proxy servers.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So Sony Pictures, for
example, gets hacked,

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and then those emails
are distributed.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's an economic
issue, but those hacks

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.850 align:middle line:84%
may have come through a
server based in Argentina,

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.260 align:middle line:84%
because they circulate through
these various computers

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And my computer at home
could have been infected,

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:84%
but when I interact with a
business entity, whatever virus

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:84%
is in my computer is transmitted
to that business entity,

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.640 align:middle line:90%
and then it is vulnerable.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've got
an antiquated grid system.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So how easy would it
be, at least cyber-wise,

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to start shutting down
some of the systems.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Well, the
SCADA system, S-C-A-D-A,

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is the most-used operational
system of our critical

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:90%
infrastructure.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:84%
It's been around for
many, many years.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:84%
In essence, we have outgrown
the original power grid.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.740 align:middle line:90%
We've added to it.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
We've put more power lines
and transformers and things,

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:90%
and we've expanded our grid.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.000 align:middle line:84%
But because it's all
interconnected, you could

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
create this cascading
effect, whereby you take down

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:84%
one substation, and as
the other substations

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
try to react through
this computer system,

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:84%
everything gets overloaded and
takes the whole system down.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And recently, you
may know, there

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.800 align:middle line:84%
was a Freedom of
Information Act request

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.070 align:middle line:84%
provided to the government about
something called the Aurora

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Experiment.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:90%
And in the government's--

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wisdom?

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: --wisdom response,
they provided the wrong report

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
that FOIA request.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And that request disclosed
publicly nine substations that,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.857 align:middle line:84%
if they were coordinated
and attacked--

00:26:10.857 --> 00:26:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bang, bang, bang.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.606 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: The whole
thing would collapse.

00:26:13.606 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, Texas might be saved.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.010 align:middle line:84%
You have the Eastern Connected
Grid and the Western Connected

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Grid.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:10%
And then you have--

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There are
three grids, right?

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:23.786 align:middle line:10%
>>AKART: Right, Texas.

00:26:23.786 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:10%
East and west are connected.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:10%
Texas is not.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:10%
And that's just
part of the Texas--

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Mentality.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Yeah, they're very
independent down there.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But they do that because
in a demand for power--

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:84%
like if Denver has major
snowstorms for several weeks,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.490 align:middle line:84%
you may not be able to generate
the power in this area.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is they then
bring power from elsewhere.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the consumer
demands it all the time,

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and they demand it
to be inexpensively.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Those energy companies
who are trying

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:84%
to comply with
consumer demand have

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:90%
created this monster for us.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:84%
As I say, it's America's
soft underbelly.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:84%
The threat is from
various sources--

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
the sun, nuclear
weapons, cyber attack.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But the end result is
the same, and that's

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:90%
a collapse of the power grid.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elon
Musk, of course, is

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
trying to develop a
system for your home

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:90%
that is self-contained.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:90%
I think that's genius.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:27.715 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: It's not difficult,
having solar panels,

00:27:27.715 --> 00:27:29.090 align:middle line:84%
or if you live in
a certain area,

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:84%
you might be able to
have wind or whatever.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.270 align:middle line:90%
The problem is the expense.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:84%
To create a solar array
that would sustain

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:84%
an average household
under normal circumstances

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.670 align:middle line:84%
so you can operate
your refrigerator

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and washer and dryer, et
cetera, costs tens of thousands

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:90%
of dollars.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.612 align:middle line:84%
If it became more affordable, I
think more people would do it.

00:27:47.612 --> 00:27:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple
thousand dollars,

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:50.795 align:middle line:90%
everybody would get it done.

00:27:50.795 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Build it into the mortgage.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.128 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Yeah, they could
build it into the mortgage.

00:27:54.128 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:84%
The government
tries to encourage

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.990 align:middle line:84%
people to take on
solar arrays by doing

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:02.187 align:middle line:84%
a couple of things, number
one, providing tax credits.

00:28:02.187 --> 00:28:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's nice, but
unless you have the ability

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.686 align:middle line:84%
to make the
underlying investment,

00:28:05.686 --> 00:28:07.500 align:middle line:84%
a tax credit doesn't
do you any good.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
thing they do

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:84%
is they try to
allow people to sell

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:84%
their excess
solar-generated power back

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:84%
to the grid for pennies
on the watt, et cetera.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Those are all admirable, but
if it was more affordable,

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I think you'd find more people
would do these types of grids.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people are prepared

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:90%
for a situation like this?

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.854 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:28:30.854 --> 00:28:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>How long would I last with
what I've got in my apartment

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.340 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Probably about 15 minutes,
I imagine, maybe 20.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>If the power were to
shut down right now,

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I would say we could
survive for about a week.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Actually, a fairly long time.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I live up in Maryland, and power
going out is a regular thing.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.605 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a big deal.

00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:56.156 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I think it would kick
in a different side of me,

00:28:56.156 --> 00:28:58.882 align:middle line:90%
a survival mode-ist me.

00:28:58.882 --> 00:29:03.240 align:middle line:84%
If the electricity ran
out, I could probably

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.976 align:middle line:90%
go for a couple of days.

00:29:05.976 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>If the power went out
now, I could probably

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:84%
last a week from the
things I have in my home.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.050 align:middle line:90%
I have some candles.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I have some firewood.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bob, just that
small group of people,

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:84%
only one person thinks
he could get by.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: And he's wrong.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:84%
At least the others admit
three to seven days.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And they would be surprised
that that probably isn't true,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.360 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.600 align:middle line:90%
But then what?

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:84%
After that three to seven
days, what are you going to do?

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.400 align:middle line:84%
The gentleman that says, oh, I
can make it no problem, I think

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:90%
is delusional.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Because you never
realize how much

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:84%
you rely upon the, whether
it be medications or food.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:84%
You can't get water
out of your sinks.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, some people can
survive longer than others.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.090 align:middle line:84%
For the people who say three
to seven and admit that,

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
what are they going
to do about it?

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.820 align:middle line:84%
If at the end of three to seven
days, when they run out of food

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and there's no FEMA truck
backing up with bottles

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:84%
of water, I mean, I've seen
incidents in recent years

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:84%
where you had the Flint,
Michigan, situation

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:90%
with the water supply.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
in West Virginia.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
People were fighting in the
parking lots over a case

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.240 align:middle line:90%
of 24 bottles of plastic water.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:90%
And that was within days.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So what's going to
happen after seven days

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:90%
when her baby is hungry?

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looting, everything.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:84%
We've seen what has
happened in cities just

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:84%
with civil unrest, the
looting and the breaking

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:90%
of the windows.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Law and order is out of control.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: And they
would be overwhelmed.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.990 align:middle line:90%
And consider this as well.

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Law enforcement-- I love them.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:42.350 align:middle line:90%
They protect us.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:90%
They do the best they can.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But first thing on
their minds will be,

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:90%
I need to protect my family.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.240 align:middle line:84%
How many law enforcement
officers are going to say,

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.260 align:middle line:84%
why do I want to go into
the city in riot gear

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and have rocks thrown at me
or maybe even being shot at,

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.160 align:middle line:84%
when my wife and
children are at home,

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and they could be
looted or attacked?

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think you'll find a
collapse of that as well.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:84%
No matter how hard we try to
clamp down in a collapse event,

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
eventually a lot of the
military and law enforcement

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.984 align:middle line:84%
will go to protect their own
rather than lose their life.

00:31:14.984 --> 00:31:16.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what you're
going to see, too,

00:31:16.775 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Bob, is a tiered system,
where for the first couple

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:84%
days of an outage, people
think they can get by.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going
to get a little worse

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and a little worse, and
then all of a sudden,

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:90%
it's out of control.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.240 align:middle line:84%
People think, for example,
all you have to do

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.510 align:middle line:84%
is go to your faucet
and turn on the water.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are electrical
pumps pushing that water

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:84%
through the system
to get to your house.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:45.600 align:middle line:84%
When those go down, ain't
gonna be any water coming out

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:90%
of that spigot.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.466 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: That's right.

00:31:47.466 --> 00:31:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be desperate for
water, because water is life.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you go three days
without it, you will die.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So they will be looking
for water sources that

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.170 align:middle line:90%
may not be safe.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I've
studied as part of my fiction

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:06.005 align:middle line:84%
series is we'll be flown into
a third-world status, 1800s,

00:32:06.005 --> 00:32:07.340 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.109 align:middle line:84%
So what's one of the
biggest causes of death

00:32:10.109 --> 00:32:11.400 align:middle line:90%
in these third world countries?

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's dysentery.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.760 align:middle line:84%
People who are
thirsty will think

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
they can drink water out of a
stream that could be polluted,

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:90%
out of a lake.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they're going to
do is get deathly ill, nausea,

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:84%
diarrhea, which will make
them even more dehydrated

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:90%
and expedite the death process.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go more than
three days without water,

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.344 align:middle line:84%
and you can't go more than
three weeks without food.

00:32:34.344 --> 00:32:36.635 align:middle line:84%
During that time, I think
people will become desperate.

00:32:36.635 --> 00:32:37.801 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's something.

00:32:37.801 --> 00:32:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked
about solar flares.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
cyber warfare.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about EMP,
which is Electromagnetic Pulse.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I notice, Bob, how you
pick the St. Louis Arch.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Thanks a lot.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: You're welcome.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Your beloved St. Louis--
I apologize for that.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But tell
us what an EMP is.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: Well,
Electromagnetic Pulse

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.820 align:middle line:84%
is a naturally occurring
event, as we've talked about.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the sun.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: As a result
of the solar flare.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But as a result of the hydrogen
weapon testing in the '40s

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and then into the
late '50s, especially

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.180 align:middle line:84%
on the Pacific
Ocean, the scientists

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:84%
began to discover that these
nuclear weapons created

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.480 align:middle line:84%
this pulse of energy that caused
their instruments to fail.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So they actually started testing
specifically for that purpose.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
well-known tests

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.670 align:middle line:84%
was in 1962 called the
Starfish Prime Test, which

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.750 align:middle line:90%
occurred near Hawaii.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And Honolulu, which is about
1,600 miles away from where

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:90%
the test occurred, lost power.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of their components
and instruments

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:84%
there failed as a
result of this EMP.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:84%
At that point in time,
all the major powers

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:84%
recognized that
this was dangerous.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of hastened after
the nuclear proliferation stage

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.250 align:middle line:84%
was over that we need
to come to agreement

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:03.270 align:middle line:84%
of this mutually-- the MAD
system of Mutual Assured

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Destruction.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:08.400 align:middle line:84%
If you shoot at us, we'll shoot
at you, and then nobody wins.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I've discussed

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:16.370 align:middle line:84%
with people is, does the
MAD doctrine, as I call it,

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
does that apply in the case of
an EMP, who does it apply to?

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe that both
Russia and China

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.640 align:middle line:84%
recognize that if they were
to shoot an EMP at us, that we

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.440 align:middle line:90%
would have--

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.159 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We would to them.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:27.835 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: We would retaliate.

00:34:27.835 --> 00:34:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
would be even worse.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: It would be worse.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But what about that next tier
of countries who do not like us

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:90%
that have nothing to lose?

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:90%
And I use Iran--

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: North Korea.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:38.791 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: And North Korea.

00:34:38.791 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Great examples.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:45.110 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the Far East,
Japan, North Korea, and all

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:49.370 align:middle line:84%
of those areas, at night
from an Earth satellite,

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.699 align:middle line:90%
you'll see a very big dark spot.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.659 align:middle line:90%
That dark spot is North Korea.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:55.510 align:middle line:84%
That's a country
that's backwards.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a country that
isn't in the 21st century.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:90%
They have nothing to lose.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they know
how to launch missiles.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: They do.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.978 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they have nukes.

00:35:02.978 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:10%
>>AKART: They have recently
tested their hydrogen weapon,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.730 align:middle line:10%
which in the press
initially was debunked

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:10%
as saying, well, this wasn't
capable of doing anything.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think they were
testing their ability

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.500 align:middle line:90%
to detonate an EMP weapon.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem with
the North Koreans

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.080 align:middle line:84%
is they don't have an
ICBM missile that's

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.750 align:middle line:84%
stable enough to shoot
from their continent

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.640 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what it
you put it on a ship?

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: What if you
put it on a freighter?

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:84%
They have sent freighters into
the Gulf of Mexico undetected.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: They could
certainly shoot 800 miles

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.210 align:middle line:84%
from the Gulf of Mexico to
the center of the country, St.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Louis, Kansas City, for
example, and detonate it

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.000 align:middle line:90%
above the Earth.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Or they could launch it
from a satellite, which

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.150 align:middle line:84%
they have successfully
launched, and, in fact,

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.760 align:middle line:84%
proved to us that
they can control it

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.027 align:middle line:84%
by sending it directly over
the Super Bowl, as they said.

00:35:55.027 --> 00:35:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that was our
concern on their most recent

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.800 align:middle line:84%
satellite launch, were because
they said the payload was

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.026 align:middle line:90%
bigger than normal.

00:36:03.026 --> 00:36:05.400 align:middle line:84%
They weren't quite so sure
what might have been up there.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Yes.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And so this lack of
intelligence on our side

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:84%
should put us on alert and
should take our Congress

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and the president to a point
where we need to do something.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the North Koreans
are a threat to us.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.040 align:middle line:90%
The Iranians are a threat to us.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:84%
The way we have treated
them geopolitically

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.150 align:middle line:90%
is beyond my comprehension.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But then let's take
it one step further.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:84%
You have a group like ISIS
that people don't really

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.780 align:middle line:90%
understand what they are.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But as you and I discussed,
it's a terrorist group

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that's worth $2 billion
that makes $2 million a day

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:84%
on human trafficking in the
sale of oil on the black market.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:84%
They can buy what
they can't create.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And they could certainly
buy the ability

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:84%
to take a freighter undetected
into the Gulf of Mexico as well

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and bring mighty
America to its knees.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If the lights
go out, what would life

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.080 align:middle line:90%
be like for a lot of people?

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>What would life be like after
a massive and prolonged power

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.430 align:middle line:90%
outage?

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
It would be pretty
hectic, I think.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Although I kind of yearn for it.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I kind of yearn
for simpler, perhaps

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:24.280 align:middle line:84%
more primitive times, like
living off the land and farming

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Although I have no skill
or expertise in that area.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'd probably-- I'm a
skinny guy, so I'd probably

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.500 align:middle line:90%
be one of the first to go.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>It would be chaotic
for a period of time.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I think it would
also be reinvigorating

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.386 align:middle line:84%
for communities to
reorganize themselves

00:37:48.386 --> 00:37:50.710 align:middle line:90%
on a true intimate level.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, people would go crazy.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I feel like people would
like kill each other.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And cannibalism would
start happening and lots

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.010 align:middle line:90%
of craziness.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:05.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think it would also
force us to actually take

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.580 align:middle line:84%
care of the Earth and
connect with the Earth

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to grow
food and how to actually

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
take care of ourselves
on a basic level

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and not be so dependent
on these outer sources.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And it would kind of like
weed out the weak ones

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:90%
that can't do that.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think it would
be kind of awesome.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>I think people would panic
because they were unprepared.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're so spoiled by
the things that we have

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:40.306 align:middle line:84%
and the luxuries that I think
it would be super chaotic.

00:38:40.306 --> 00:38:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people,
Bob, are a little

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:44.340 align:middle line:84%
naive about this
entire situation.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for the
first couple days,

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I think it's easy for
all of us to prepare.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've talked about it on
"Coast to Coast," where you get

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:52.990 align:middle line:90%
some food for a couple weeks.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:90%
You get enough water put away.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's good
for the short term.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.290 align:middle line:10%
But what are we going to
do about the long term

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:04.560 align:middle line:10%
if the power grid is gone
for a year or two years?

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't have enough
transformers, for example,

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:90%
to bring into the country.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
What do we do if
it gets that long?

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, we're up
a creek, aren't we?

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Most people will be.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
plan ahead and think

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.020 align:middle line:90%
about, where will I go?

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of folks might think
they can just head out I-70 out

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:27.077 align:middle line:84%
into the country or, in
my neck of the woods, go

00:39:27.077 --> 00:39:28.410 align:middle line:90%
and the farmers will take me in.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:28.870 align:middle line:90%
They won't.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.661 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think we
have traffic jams now

00:39:30.661 --> 00:39:31.570 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles?

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Exactly.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wait till this happens.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: That's exactly right.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about--
what will be interesting,

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.200 align:middle line:84%
you'll have small communities
that will band together.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
close their borders.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And when the golden hordes,
as they're referred to,

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.460 align:middle line:84%
come out of the city
looking for food and water,

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.160 align:middle line:84%
they'll find that
they're not welcome,

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.364 align:middle line:84%
because people will
take care of their own.

00:39:52.364 --> 00:39:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Those who think
they're just going

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to go out and start a
garden and feed themselves

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.320 align:middle line:90%
are very naive, as you say.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.740 align:middle line:84%
First off, they probably
have never tried to grow food

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't have
the first clue--

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and it
takes time to grow food.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: It takes time.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.250 align:middle line:90%
It takes seeds.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You gotta eat tomorrow.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.950 align:middle line:10%
It's going to take you three
months to grow some tomatoes.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.580 align:middle line:10%
And that's not going to last
you too long, especially

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.390 align:middle line:10%
if your neighbor steals them.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: That's right.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.540 align:middle line:84%
The process of prepping
is three steps.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Number one, protect yourself.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Number two, have sufficient food
and water and medical supplies

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.620 align:middle line:84%
to last until you can start
growing and harvesting

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.450 align:middle line:90%
and canning your own food.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And then to have
long-term food storage

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:84%
to supplement what you
won't be able to take

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.960 align:middle line:90%
in now as nutrients.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And it could be simple like
beans and rice and pastas,

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:44.920 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But you want to be able
to have a short-term plan,

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.800 align:middle line:84%
a mid-term plan, and
a long-term plan.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's really not that
involved and that expensive.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
deciding it's important.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.969 align:middle line:84%
And people can undertake
that process very easily.

00:40:59.969 --> 00:41:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if the
power system goes down

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.880 align:middle line:84%
in the dead of winter when
it's 5 degrees above zero,

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.020 align:middle line:90%
what do you do there?

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.566 align:middle line:90%
You're out of luck.

00:41:07.566 --> 00:41:08.690 align:middle line:90%
How do you heat your house?

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Your pipes begin to break.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Everything falls apart.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: You have to have
alternative heating sources.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I'd suggest
to people, if you can,

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:21.930 align:middle line:84%
consider reducing your
lifestyle and moving

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.421 align:middle line:90%
to an area that's more rural.

00:41:24.421 --> 00:41:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people can do that, Bob?

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AKART: They can if
they're committed.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, I understand that you may
have a fabulous job working

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.090 align:middle line:90%
for the bank in downtown LA.

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But what you might
consider doing

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:84%
is moving out into an
area and take a lesser pay

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and maybe sell one of your cars
and move into a smaller home.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of how important

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:48.740 align:middle line:84%
is it to you to be prepared
for an event like this.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And not everybody
is willing to do

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.540 align:middle line:84%
that, which is why the
EMP Commission said

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.220 align:middle line:90%
90% will not survive.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The biggest
problem, I think,

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.240 align:middle line:84%
it is that people don't
believe it could happen.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AKART: Yes.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.960 align:middle line:90%
The threat is real.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.290 align:middle line:10%
That's why I wrote the books.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:10%
Because the books
tell in great detail

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:12.160 align:middle line:10%
not only the history behind
cyber warfare and EMP,

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.870 align:middle line:10%
but then also the
real-life instances

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.610 align:middle line:10%
of how these things
have been used.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But then the most
important part, I believe,

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:23.700 align:middle line:84%
is where I tell people the
very realistic, simple steps

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.250 align:middle line:84%
that you can take
to get prepared.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's good.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be the
presenter of doom and gloom,

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.330 align:middle line:84%
but, folks, if the
grid goes down,

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.360 align:middle line:84%
