>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, what you're

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:10%
about to hear on "Beyond
Belief" is truly beyond belief.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing story by Captain
Randy Kramer Marine Corps.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have
the Captain tell us

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:84%
his story because coming from
him, you will understand.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the program.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER: Oh,
thanks for having me.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I should call you
Captain, I was in the Navy.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Ah, it's--

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We can do that.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.164 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It's unofficial.

00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:90%
You can call me Randy.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.538 align:middle line:84%
People call me
Captain all the time

00:00:51.538 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:90%
but I never get picky about it.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been
researching you.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, good.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing story.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It was an
interesting experience

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:90%
to have I'll tell you that.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.444 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
when it happened

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:02.849 align:middle line:90%
and what happened to you.

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:10%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I mean
it all goes back

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:10%
to early development
in early childhood.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.390 align:middle line:10%
Being a construct
of a program that

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:10%
was genetically engineered,
built from the ground up.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Training programs started
when I was like, four

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:90%
or five years old.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Training program went
until I was 17 years old.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And at 17 years old I
was deployed actually

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
into the covert military
space program, sent to Mars

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.630 align:middle line:90%
for 17 years to be in the MDF.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wait a
minute, wait a minute.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Sent to Mars?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How were
you sent to Mars?

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, well, via a--

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a space ship?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Via a transport
ship from the Moon,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:84%
from Lunar Operations Command
that probably, my guessing,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:84%
it was probably four
or five stories high

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.194 align:middle line:84%
that probably had 4,000 or 5,000
personnel on it at that time.

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What year
might that have been?

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That would
have been in 1987.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, continue.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So we were put
onto a transport ship.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm guessing about 4,000
or 5,000 people it held total.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And then that ship took off
from Lunar Operations Command

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:90%
on the Moon.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And then that ship went
through a wormhole to Mars.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So the whole trip
took a few minutes.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we landed on the
tarmac at Ares Primis, which

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
was the military headquarters
corporate headquarters

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:90%
of the Mars colonies.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I was sent to a forward
station far, far north, What.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I sort of refer to
as "Alaska region."

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
As far as I mean, if you were
to compare latitudes here

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.654 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, it was
very, very far north.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very,
very cold region

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
that we were a part of at a
place called Forward Station

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Zebra.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And spent the better part of
17 years in the MDF there.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.009 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Randy, do you
know how wild this sounds?

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I've had
some conversations

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.049 align:middle line:84%
with people and yeah, it blows
some people's mind sometimes,

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do people believe you?

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: A lot of
them surprisingly do.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, when
I say it out loud,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I understand how outside the
box it sounds, believe me.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But having
experienced it myself,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.549 align:middle line:84%
all I'm really talking
about is my own memories,

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
my own perspective of how it
happened when I was there.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.131 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's a very matter
of fact set of experiences

00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:90%
because I was there.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
But I get that it's outside the
normal realm of most people's

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.305 align:middle line:90%
And to most people it's a what?

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.230 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to find out
how this project developed--

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --where it is
today, what other countries

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.525 align:middle line:90%
might be doing like that.

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not here to
doubt you nor am I here

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.114 align:middle line:84%
to destroy your
story by any means.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I appreciate that.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just want to hear
from you in your own views.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll let our "Beyond
Belief" audience decide hey,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84%
we think this guy's telling
the truth or maybe he isn't.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:90%
But let me ask you this--

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Please.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --if you're not telling
the truth that's in quotes, OK?

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going on
the assumption you are.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if you're
not telling the truth,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:84%
what are you
getting out of this?

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.312 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Not much.

00:04:02.312 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But I also like to point out,
if I'm not telling the truth,

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:84%
then I am committing
a number of felonies,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:84%
including felony
impersonating an officer.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.394 align:middle line:84%
And I have encouraged people
who think that I'm not

00:04:10.394 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
telling the truth to
report me to the FBI

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.435 align:middle line:84%
or to the CMCs office
in the Marine Corps.

00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I know some people who have
had those conversations

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.768 align:middle line:84%
and those people are not
interested in talking to me.

00:04:18.768 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
If I was committing fraud, I
would get a letter from the FBI

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
or from the CMCs office
telling me to cease and desist.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And then my attorney
and I, we could get

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.468 align:middle line:90%
into that whole conversation.

00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But no one sent me any
letters because I'm not

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:90%
committing fraud.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.368 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're not making
a million dollars doing this.

00:04:32.368 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I do a few speaking events
and a few interviews.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And no, I don't
get paid anything.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you do
in your normal "life"

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.592 align:middle line:90%
in terms of job or career?

00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I have to work
a day job at the moment, which

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:90%
isn't any fun.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's what I
have to do to pay the bills.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
day job conflict

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
with this story in the point
where people that you work with

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:90%
go, Randy, what is this?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I don't talk to
people at my day job about--

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
they see this show?

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.423 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, then we'll
have a conversation about it.

00:05:05.423 --> 00:05:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm perfectly open to
always talk about it

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.926 align:middle line:84%
with anybody who wants
to talk about it.

00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
shy away from it.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to create
attention in a situation

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:90%
where I don't need attention.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.884 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not an
attention grabber

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
so I don't go around telling
people, I went to Mars.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just not
that big of a deal to me.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:84%
But when people want
to talk about it,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm more than happy to talk.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.588 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're really
you're not gaining anything

00:05:26.588 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:90%
coming out with this story.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No, I haven't--

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
if anything, in
the last six years,

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
it has cost me more than I
have ever possibly potentially

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
gained from this in
personal relationships,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in a destroyed marriage, and
a number of other things.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why, because
they don't believe you?

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't even want
to discuss the particulars

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:90%
of that situation.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say that it was--

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let me
rephrase the question.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.985 align:middle line:84%
Did what you're telling us
today affect your marriage?

00:05:57.985 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Let's just
say that another--

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:84%
a third party took advantage of
a situation in which they felt

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.355 align:middle line:84%
could be exploited with
someone else's insecurities.

00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so they
took advantage of a weakness.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm
reading the picture.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: But to say that
when my ex-wife and I met,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.457 align:middle line:84%
she was a firm believer
in my telling the truth.

00:06:20.457 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that changed?

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.664 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: And that changed.

00:06:22.664 --> 00:06:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
disappoint you?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It's heartbreaking.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:90%
But again--

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sorry.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --I'm not really
here to talk about that.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm sorry
to had to go through that

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for sharing
part of that with us.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:84%
You're not the first
person to come forward

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.094 align:middle line:84%
with these kinds of
incredible stories.

00:06:38.094 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And I
won't be the last.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that leads us
to believe that something's

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:90%
going on, whatever it may be.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: For sure.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's go back
to the recruitment portion.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to look at a little
video from "Deep Space: Inside

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:90%
the Program."

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: If there is
a breakaway civilization

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:10%
how do they get
people to join them?

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:10%
Is there a recruitment process?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:10%
We shall discover
that getting people

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:10%
to join the Secret
Space Program is more

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:10%
complex than first imagined.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Some are asked.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:10%
Some are made.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.554 align:middle line:10%
And some appear to be
taken against their will.

00:07:22.554 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:10%
>>LAURA EISENHOWER:
There's recruitments

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.719 align:middle line:10%
where certain
individuals are picked

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:10%
to participate in
projects and to be

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.020 align:middle line:10%
a part of particular agendas.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:10%
I have an experience
myself of being

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.432 align:middle line:10%
recruited to go off planet in
2006 to join a Mars colony.

00:07:37.432 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:10%
And so there's
specific reasons why

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.181 align:middle line:10%
certain individuals are picked.

00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:10%
And to get to the bottom of
it is not the easiest thing

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:10%
because I mean, you're
unraveling a huge mystery.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's things like
quantum access technologies

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:10%
that are used to
target individuals.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:10%
What I discovered in
my recruitment process

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.377 align:middle line:10%
is something called Looking
Glass Technologies was used

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:10%
and something called
the Orion's Cube.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:10%
These were names that were
in the emails connected

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:10%
to how I was chosen.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And this isn't just tracking me
in this particular incarnation,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:10%
there is a pre-targeting
before I was born.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.715 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of strategies
are in place.

00:08:12.715 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:10%
Or if we kind of look at
the bigger picture in some

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:10%
of these controller groups
and how they manage timelines

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:10%
and how they work with
these technologies

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.724 align:middle line:10%
to achieve a specific
desired result.

00:08:22.724 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:10%
These things have been in
the works for a long time.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:10%
And so when we look at different
elements of like the defense

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:10%
departments and things that
happened after the Second World

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:10%
War, we're dealing with
certain agendas that had

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:10%
good intentions to start with.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.152 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:42.152 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I love Laura.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:90%
She's fabulous.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's a great person.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A dedicated researcher.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.498 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I know her very
well, she's fabulous.

00:08:48.498 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Captain, let's go
back to the beginning then.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Was your family involved in this
at all or were you the first?

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm pretty certain
that my older siblings were

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:84%
also put into programs
because of the family's

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:90%
genetic heritage.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever
mingling that they

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:84%
decided to do at the pre-birth
and birthing process.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Both of my siblings
exhibited early childhood

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
post-traumatic stress
disorder symptoms, like I did.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But I seemed to have a better
set of coping mechanisms

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:90%
than they did.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not in complete
denial about my existence

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.233 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't say
that I was the first

00:09:30.233 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
but I would say that
I was probably a more

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:90%
perfected version by the--

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you go willingly
or did they pull you in to it?

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I was--

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:84%
from what I understand is
that it's been told to me

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
there was a drawing
board process

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:84%
in which part of my mother's
DNA and my father's DNA

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:90%
were laid out.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they decided which
parts they wanted to change.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So my entire genetic code
was written in a laboratory

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
before I was actually even
created as a life form.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So I was built from the
ground up as a person.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you undergone
hypnotic regression?

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
do they tell you?

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Just recovered
more clarified memories

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:84%
of my experiences
really more than usual.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But those experiences
come out in the end.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But I would point out
that hypnosis is just

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to get your brain into
a natural alpha or theta state,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:90%
which meditation does anyway.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And so most of my
memory retrieval

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
is through meditation process
to get into theta states.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.009 align:middle line:84%
But hypnosis is just
someone else walking you

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
through that process to
get to those theta states

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
retrieve your memory.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, your brain
is like a tape recorder.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.036 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
think what hypnosis

00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:84%
does is it rewinds that
tape in a strategic way

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:90%
to get the answers.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
convinced, Randy,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that if you looked
at a crowd of 1,000

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%
people and people
would just say, hey,

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:90%
was George Noory in that crowd?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:90%
You'd probably say I don't know.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see him.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.050 align:middle line:84%
But under hypnosis,
it's in your brain

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and I think you could
pinpoint yeah, he was.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
He was in the fourth
row on the left.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.030 align:middle line:90%
It happens like that.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this particular
case with you,

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:84%
this secret program
that was done,

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.599 align:middle line:84%
how many people do you think
are involved in it today?

00:11:15.599 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh goodness gracious.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you want to talk
about the covert military space

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:84%
program or Secret
Space Program at large,

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.900 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about hundreds of
thousands potentially millions

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:90%
of people but at this point.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they all
knowledgeable of what's

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.259 align:middle line:84%
happening to them or are they
walking around in a daze?

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's all
compartmentalized.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So depending on where you are,
what stage of your service in,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
or whether they've sent you back
and put the quote unquote "back

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:84%
into your timeline to live
out your fate or your destiny"

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:90%
as sometimes it's referred to.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time,
most of those people

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:84%
are returned with
repressed memories.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So they don't
remember much of it.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:84%
They often have,
like I did, a series

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:84%
of emotional, psychological
attachments or traumas

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:84%
associated with
their experience.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But the linear conscious
memory is often detached.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you're still in
service, then you're

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
actively remembering what's
going on at that time.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But for security
reasons they pretty much

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:84%
suppress people's memories
when they return them,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
so I'd say that the
majority of people

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
who have returned
from service have

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.417 align:middle line:84%
little or no understanding
or memory of what

00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:23.250 align:middle line:90%
they've experienced.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I get e-mails from
people all the time

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:84%
who are in the process of
recovering memory, that

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
are in the process
of getting there.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
But were absolutely
not even at a stage

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.119 align:middle line:84%
where they want to go
public or do an interview.

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the last
thing that they want to do.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
They're still trying
to figure out what's

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.331 align:middle line:90%
going on with themselves.

00:12:38.331 --> 00:12:40.170 align:middle line:90%
They're in an earlier state.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
When I say "earlier state"
that I was in myself,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
which is very
confusing because--

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it frustrating?

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Incredibly because
you get these memories-- they're

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:90%
very clear, they're very vivid.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
They're often
incredibly visceral

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally traumatic.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
But because they don't
match a linear map

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to what you think you
understand your life is,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make any sense.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And so while you're missing
those linear components,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
you're like well,
OK, I remember this.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:90%
It feels incredibly real.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.120 align:middle line:90%
It feels traumatic.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:90%
It's very vivid.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But where's the
linear connection?

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.167 align:middle line:84%
How in the world
did I get there?

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
people don't know what

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.958 align:middle line:90%
to make of their experiences.

00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.567 align:middle line:84%
Or they do like I did for
a certain amount of time,

00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:84%
which is question
their mental health.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say, did
you think you were going crazy?

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: At times, absolutely.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
The thing that changed that,
which I was so grateful for,

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.699 align:middle line:84%
I had a very dear friend who
is a psychiatrist, actually.

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And we were sitting
in my living room

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:90%
one day having a cup of tea.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.726 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, you know, I'm
really not sure what's going on

00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:39.850 align:middle line:90%
with my head at the moment.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, I either have
this amazing, crazy case

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.100 align:middle line:84%
of post-traumatic
stress disorder

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.564 align:middle line:84%
that I need to sort out
or I'm absolutely bonkers.

00:13:47.564 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really not sure
where to go with that.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was so cool
and calm about it.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, well, OK,
let's break out the book.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.802 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled out
the DSM-IV, which

00:13:55.802 --> 00:13:57.010 align:middle line:90%
it was the four at that time.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And said, let's
look at your symptoms.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.004 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at all of
these other possibilities.

00:14:02.004 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at schizophrenia.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.794 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at
schizoaffective disorder.

00:14:04.794 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at bipolar disorder.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And we went through
them one at a time.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ruled them all out.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And we
ruled them all out

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.878 align:middle line:84%
until we got to post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:14:10.878 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was you know, 1, 2, 3,
4, all the way down the line.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So it was, at that point,
I felt medically convinced

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:84%
by a medical
professional that we had

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:90%
looked at my behavioral health.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.930 align:middle line:84%
I did not have
enough of symptoms

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to be labeled or
classified as any

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:84%
of the other behavioral
health conditions.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.092 align:middle line:84%
And I had a solid link to
medical post-traumatic stress

00:14:31.092 --> 00:14:33.550 align:middle line:84%
disorder, which then meant that
the experiences that I were

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
having were in
fact real traumatic

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
experiences that
I had to sort out.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
in the program now?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Which program?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.507 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Mars
or the Moon program?

00:14:44.507 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm still a part
of United States Marine Corps

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Special Section.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Officers have life
commissions, which

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
means I don't ever get to
get out until the day I die.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the CIA.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.775 align:middle line:90%
Once you're in, you're in.

00:14:55.775 --> 00:14:56.575 align:middle line:90%
Like the mob.

00:14:56.575 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: A little bit--
yeah, a little bit.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I will
continue to do my work

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and be associated with them
and have communications

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:90%
with the command staff.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But I'm definitely
in a unique position

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.100 align:middle line:84%
where there's plenty of other
people within the program that

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:90%
don't want me talking publicly.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:90%
And plenty of other people--

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are you
talking publicly?

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Because my Brigadier
General and the command

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.240 align:middle line:90%
staff asked me to talk publicly.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, they feel-- well, I
guess the long and short

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
of that is they feel
that the conversations

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
with our extraterrestrial
friends and business partners

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.984 align:middle line:84%
has been that we're supposed to
have a global disclosure moment

00:15:35.984 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
so that people can come into the
know and the awareness of that.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So that we can be
making when I say "we,"

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
we as an entire
civilization as the people

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.135 align:middle line:84%
can make informed decisions
about what's going on

00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and what we're doing.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:84%
People can't vote and then
make an informed decision.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.749 align:middle line:84%
There's no real democracy
making informed decisions

00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:56.290 align:middle line:84%
so people don't know the truth
about what they're voting for,

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.884 align:middle line:90%
what decisions they're making.

00:15:57.884 --> 00:15:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So there are a number
of extraterrestrials who

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.072 align:middle line:90%
believe that that's important.

00:16:02.072 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
That it's important that
people aren't lied to.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:84%
That it's important we
don't lie to the public.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.531 align:middle line:84%
That it's important
that we bring everybody

00:16:07.531 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:90%
into a truthful awareness.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's has been this
conversation for decades

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:90%
on when that's supposed to be.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.615 align:middle line:84%
The command staff
feels like that we

00:16:16.615 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and when I use this
other "we," that those

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
within the covert military
space program projects

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
have delayed and delayed
and delayed and delayed

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:84%
that process to the point
of it harming civilization

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the command staff decided
with a lot of other personnel,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of other officers
within Radiant Guardian,

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that they needed to
pick a spokesperson

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
to have a conversation to
talk to the general public.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.622 align:middle line:84%
And there was a short
list of officers,

00:16:44.622 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:84%
from what I understand,
at first and that

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:84%
was whittled down and
eventually got to me.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.624 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
reluctant in the beginning?

00:16:50.624 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: At first, oh yeah.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
When my Brigadier
asked me, he said,

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.818 align:middle line:84%
do you want to go
public with your story?

00:16:54.818 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:90%
I was furious.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you kidding me?

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:56.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely do not want
to go public with my story.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be "that guy."

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not going
to be "that guy."

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm not going to be
"that guy" are you kidding me?

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't want to do this.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.440 align:middle line:84%
We had conversations,
I would say, over

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440 align:middle line:90%
about a two week period.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:90%
It really took some convincing.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:13.990 align:middle line:84%
He really had to kind of
have a lot of conversations

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
about the pros, the cons,
what was better or not better

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:90%
about me doing that.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
And I was convinced over time.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But at first, no I was
incredibly reluctant

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.109 align:middle line:84%
and had no interest in
doing this job whatsoever.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.734 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I've got to tell
you, Randy, I have interviewed,

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:84%
in my career,
thousands of people--

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:90%
thousands of people.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:84%
There's an element
of belief to you.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for body language.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for signs.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:90%
And I don't see it from you.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, when I was
first talking with my Brigadier

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:52.489 align:middle line:84%
and we were discussing how I
should talk or how I should

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:90%
present the information--

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you been
schooled in this interview?

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.767 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No, no, no, no.

00:17:56.767 --> 00:17:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Just like I said, in
the very beginning when

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:84%
my Brigadier and I were
having conversations about how

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.346 align:middle line:84%
to talk to people or how
to talk to the public

00:18:03.346 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and one of my
questions was, what

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:90%
do you want me to tell people?

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.151 align:middle line:84%
How do you want me to
package information?

00:18:08.151 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:90%
How do you want me to do this?

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And he basically said, it
is the most important thing

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that you do nothing other
than tell the truth.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
He said, don't package anything
in a way that isn't truthful,

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:90%
that isn't honest.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.017 align:middle line:84%
Don't misrepresent yourself
in any way, shape, or form.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, the most important
thing that we want you to do

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
is be 100% honest, 100%
truthful all the time.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
He said, now, there
may be certain things

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.637 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
want to tell people

00:18:30.637 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:84%
or you don't want to
share because you think

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.595 align:middle line:84%
it may be a little too
outside the box and he said,

00:18:34.595 --> 00:18:35.590 align:middle line:90%
that's your call.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.330 align:middle line:90%
If you don't want to share--

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I want outside the box.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: He says, if you've
had an experience that you think

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.996 align:middle line:84%
is a little too outside the
box and you don't want to talk

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.415 align:middle line:90%
about it, that's up to you.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, I just want to make
sure that you understand you

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
always be honest you
always tell the truth

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and you never deviate from
that as much as possible

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:90%
because people can feel that.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:90%
People can hear it.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:90%
People can sense it.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
we want is for people

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.063 align:middle line:84%
to think that you're not
being honest or truthful.

00:18:59.063 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So from day one, I have
endeavored to just be--

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
to sort of get out
of my own way as it

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
were when I talk to
people about this

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and just tell people
the absolute truth

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:84%
from the best of my recollection
of what I remember happened.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about the
Moon trip first and then Mars.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain to us
some of the things that I'm

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:90%
going to ask you in a second.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
When did the Moon trip
occur, the first one for you?

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: The first one?

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I
mean, the first one

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:90%
would have been in childhood.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They took you as a kid?

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, we
started training

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:84%
when I was probably about
four or five years old.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now we landed
on the Moon, "officially" 1969.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Unofficially,
we landed on the Moon

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.450 align:middle line:90%
a couple of decades before that.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
we went to the moon

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
before Neil Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin?

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The military had the
first lunar base, I believe,

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.842 align:middle line:90%
built in about 1955.

00:19:53.842 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who might be the
first American on the Moon,

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:90%
if it wasn't Neil Armstrong?

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Some nameless
covert military space program

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:84%
astronaut who we'll
probably never know.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I certainly
don't know who it was.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.947 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did anybody die
of tragedy on the Moon?

00:20:06.947 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would say almost
certainly in the early days

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
because even though
they were using advanced

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.830 align:middle line:84%
reverse engineered technology
from extraterrestrial vehicles

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:84%
that we had recovered
in the '40s,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:90%
it's still the early days.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So mistakes were made
and I'm sure people died

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:90%
in the process.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.856 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Armstrong and
Aldrin know about this program?

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There's
some discussion

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:84%
about that but most people
internally agree that they

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.810 align:middle line:90%
had some briefing about that.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they knew that
when they got there,

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
one of their main
missions was to look for

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and/or explore artifacts or
a very old crashed vehicle--

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or facilities.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.615 align:middle line:90%
Did they find them?

00:20:44.615 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: My
understanding is they did.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.615 align:middle line:84%
My understanding that was part
of their job and they did.

00:20:48.615 --> 00:20:50.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so
you go there as a kid.

00:20:50.995 --> 00:20:51.795 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yep.

00:20:51.795 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why take
a kid to the Moon?

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Training.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:84%
The training process from four
years old to 17 years old--

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:90%
it was vast.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you in a
space suit over there?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: No, most of the time
it's in this base called Lunar

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Operations Command, which is a
vast underground facility that

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:84%
has some top ground facility
but most of it is stories

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:90%
and levels and levels--

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
remember landing there?

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I can remember coming
in a couple of times on a TR-3B

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and entering into a hangar,
coming down on an elevator

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it closes?

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And the elevator
basically comes down

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:90%
onto a landing platform.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It drops, which turns out
to be a large elevator,

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:90%
drops down into an elevator.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
The landing platform
closes and then

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
it's in a large hangar,
which is like stacks

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.899 align:middle line:90%
and stacks of bookshelves.

00:21:38.899 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All underground?

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, except each
bookshelf is a square unit

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.400 align:middle line:90%
that a ship can park into.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how many people
are with you on this journey?

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It would vary but
I would say on the vehicle

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.130 align:middle line:84%
at any given time anywhere
from 15 to 30 other recruits

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:90%
or passengers.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.522 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Primarily kids?

00:21:57.522 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Primarily
of the same age group

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:90%
of whatever I was at the time.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So if I was five, it was
a bunch of five-year-olds.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
If I was 10, it was a
bunch of 10-year-olds.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:84%
If I was 13, it was a
bunch of 13-year-olds.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So at what age did
you stop going to the Moon?

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.666 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean, I don't
know about stopped going.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was on and off all
the way up until my deployment

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:90%
to my tour when I was 17.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.474 align:middle line:84%
And then the return trip
was a stop at the Moon and--

00:22:24.474 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then you started
going to Mars, which

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:90%
we'll get into in a second.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
tour of duty to Mars,

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
it was another return trip back
to Lunar Operations Command

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:84%
for what they call
"age reversing."

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they doing there?

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: What do you mean,
what are they doing there?

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what
are they doing?

00:22:38.925 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:90%
They're there for purpose.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.674 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: What aren't
they doing there?

00:22:41.674 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the purpose?

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: To have the
largest forward operating

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
station for the covert
military space program that's

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:90%
not based on planet Earth.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the most
secure place you

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
can have something is
where no civilian can

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
walk across a boundary
line or cross a fence.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And no one can walk across
from here to the Moon

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.760 align:middle line:84%
or across that fence,
or across that yard so

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.010 align:middle line:90%
to speak, without a spaceship.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's the most
secure place to have

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
a covert military operating
facilities on the Moon

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.360 align:middle line:90%
or farther out.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It truly is--

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: But from
what I understand,

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:90%
they're doing everything there.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.790 align:middle line:90%
They do training there.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.690 align:middle line:84%
They're doing science
experiments there.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain amount
of civilian personnel

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.320 align:middle line:84%
that come to visit
to observe what's

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:84%
going on in the covert
military space program.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
There's financiers, bankers,
who are dealing with the money

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:90%
side of the program.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a massive, massive
military facility.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
facility is just huge?

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:90%
How did they build it?

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.965 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Over time.

00:23:40.965 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Keep digging down and
down and building large--

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they must
have sent equipment--

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh yeah.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --digging equipment.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So the size of the crafts
to get that stuff there

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.660 align:middle line:90%
must have been huge.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Some of them
were probably pretty big.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of the early
Aurora saucer craft

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
are you know the size
of a football field.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're 100 meters,
300 feet wide or so.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So they could put a whole bunch
of a construction equipment

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:90%
on a vehicle that big.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The whistleblower,
William Tompkins, talks a lot

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM TOMPKINS: I was
assigned to design for the Navy

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:30.920 align:middle line:10%
about 16, 18 different classes
of US Navy battle group ships,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:10%
which didn't exist.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:10%
And the larger ones were from
one kilometer to six kilometer.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:10%
These ships fly in space.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:10%
They're spacecraft carriers.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:10%
I designed US Navy
space craft carriers,

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:54.170 align:middle line:10%
which finally got built back
in the late '70s up in Utah

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.940 align:middle line:10%
underneath the ground.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:10%
And you've seen the pictures
of US Navy spaceships, Solar

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:10%
Warden.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:10%
So Solar Warden came out
of a think tank inside

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:10%
of engineering at Douglas.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:10%
And a whole lot of
other stuff came out.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why would he be lying?

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, he's not.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
I spent the end of my 20
year career as a pilot

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.332 align:middle line:90%
aboard the EDF SS Nautilus.

00:25:25.332 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:84%
The Nautilus is one of those
ships that's a couple of miles

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.721 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One of his designs?

00:25:28.721 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:84%
It's basically an
aircraft carrier

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.820 align:middle line:90%
that's like a long tube.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Branding is absolutely
amazing-- the story.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:90%
So you're on the Moon.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
You're doing things,
you're doing studies.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:84%
What was the time period you
would stay at any given time?

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would say
anywhere from about 16 hours

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.807 align:middle line:90%
to two or three weeks at a time.

00:25:52.807 --> 00:25:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So nothing
really longer than that?

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.723 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: No, that was
usually a training session.

00:25:56.723 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they constantly
replacing personnel

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.516 align:middle line:84%
or were people there
for three, four years?

00:26:02.516 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't know what the
typical tour of duty for people

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
at Lunar Operations
Command is but I

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:84%
know there is a constant
rotation of personnel.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the MDF,
we had a weekly rotation

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:84%
of we would lose
people that would die

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and then we would end up having
new people come in every week.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:84%
We had the kitchen
staff, the galley staff,

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
which was basically
civilian contractors, who

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:90%
would come in and service.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.789 align:middle line:84%
Food would rotate out about
every three or four weeks.

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So they had a rotation
that was about every month

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:33.746 align:middle line:90%
or a month and a half.

00:26:33.746 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
anybody born on the moon?

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Not that I could
say personally aware of.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.436 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised
if at some point

00:26:42.436 --> 00:26:44.060 align:middle line:84%
that was a scientific
experiment that--

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because that would
be truly an extraterrestrial.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.598 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right, it would be.

00:26:47.598 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I know that they,
the colonies on Mars,

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
have had people actually
born on Mars since then

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.586 align:middle line:90%
who then are Earth transplants.

00:26:56.586 --> 00:26:58.210 align:middle line:84%
But if they're born
there, then they're

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:90%
not Earthlings anymore--

00:26:59.170 --> 00:26:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're martians.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --they're
human martians.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.483 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're martians.

00:27:02.483 --> 00:27:04.935 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if they're considered
citizens of this planet?

00:27:04.935 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They
are not considered

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:90%
terrestrial citizens.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They're considered citizens
of the Mars colonies.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And because of the gravity,
they can never come back here.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on to
Mars for a second.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:84%
When you started going
to Mars, did they

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.170 align:middle line:84%
have a fully equipped
base at the time

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
or were you in its
infancy as well?

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh no.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I would say that everything
had been well developed.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I felt like
when I showed up there

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I was showed up in the middle
of a well oiled machine

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:90%
operation--

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:33.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ready to go.

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:36.582 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --going on for
years before I got there.

00:27:36.582 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
advantage of being on Mars?

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.744 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing there?

00:27:40.744 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't know about
the advantage but they trying

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.860 align:middle line:84%
to sustain and defend
the colonies, which

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:90%
I can't say I know much about.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:84%
We never got to go to
the colonies or see them.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:84%
We were kept very
separate from them.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
is the colonies are

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
engaged in mining operations,
agricultural operations.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Basically anything
and everything

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that a colony would want to
do to say both self-sufficient

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to create
enough excess of something

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:84%
to trade back to the planet
or somewhere else for profits.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.302 align:middle line:84%
Because these have to be
financially profitable

00:28:13.302 --> 00:28:15.260 align:middle line:84%
ventures, according to
the financial people who

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:90%
are in charge of them.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But as a military
operative, our job

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.670 align:middle line:84%
was simply to occupy the
base in which we occupied

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and to patrol and defend
or protect a certain grid

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.220 align:middle line:84%
territory that was on our
map to defend and protect.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are other
countries there?

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I would say what they used
to call the G8 countries,

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
list of countries

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:84%
there are personnel from
all of those countries

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.840 align:middle line:84%
that are at some point in
part of the covert military--

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.716 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we
bring them along?

00:28:45.716 --> 00:28:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, those people--

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
my understanding is that
each country who participates

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.210 align:middle line:90%
takes personnel in a "parcel."

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and that parcel is then handed
over in a stack of paperwork

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.140 align:middle line:84%
to covert military space
program activities.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Some bureaucrat, some
low level officers,

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.150 align:middle line:84%
junior officers at
Lunar Operations Command

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:84%
get that stack of paperwork
on what that personnel is.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.409 align:middle line:84%
And then their job is to
assign those personnel

00:29:13.409 --> 00:29:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to the various positions
within the program

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that they need to
put bodies into.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At any given time,
because of space and distance,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:90%
how long were you on Mars?

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: A little
over 17 years.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 17-- straight?

00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, continuous.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:90%
I lived there.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.706 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were on Mars
for 17 straight years?

00:29:30.706 --> 00:29:32.455 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: 17 years,
three months, 14 days.

00:29:32.455 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it feel
like a prison sentence?

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it didn't
feel like that.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.874 align:middle line:84%
It felt like a lengthy
deployment, you know?

00:29:41.874 --> 00:29:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It felt like this
is where we were

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.670 align:middle line:90%
going to be for a long time.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I'd say after the
first few years,

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.840 align:middle line:84%
we were pretty
acclimated that this

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:84%
is just what we were going
to do until we were not

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:84%
doing it anymore, until we
either dead or got sent back.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you have a salary?

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I was supposed to
be accruing a salary that

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.116 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to
go into an account

00:30:00.116 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that I was supposed
to get later.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But that turns out
to be sort of a lie

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that they tell
everybody because--

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.566 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you got nothing?

00:30:05.566 --> 00:30:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Got nothing.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:90%
(WHISPERS) Nothing.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were on
Mars for 17 years--

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.070 align:middle line:84%
of course you didn't
have to worry about rent.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Food was provided.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.979 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, and health care.

00:30:17.979 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you thought
you were earning--

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Accruing the paycheck
that was going into an account.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you figured you
would have how much by the time

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:90%
you came back?

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, it
should have been--

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A million dollars.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --well over a
million dollars, yeah.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you had nothing?

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I got nothing.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you feel cheated?

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.206 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, since I
couldn't remember right away

00:30:35.206 --> 00:30:36.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel anything about it.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But once I started to
remember the process,

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I got pretty angry about
being cheated in that process.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
stiffing everybody?

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.701 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, absolutely.

00:30:43.701 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:84%
It's how they save money by not
paying their person-- there's

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:84%
essentially this very
quasi gray line with what's

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:90%
slavery and not slavery.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Which is another
thing that a lot

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.740 align:middle line:84%
of our extraterrestrial
friends are unhappy about.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
other worlds that we

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
have agreements and treaties
with who think that slavery

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.100 align:middle line:84%
is essentially an amoral
unethical activity.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And that we have
treaties and contracts

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.700 align:middle line:84%
signed that we're not supposed
to engage in acts of slavery.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So as long as we're doing
things that are quasi slavery,

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.550 align:middle line:84%
then we have these
disagreements about what

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.466 align:middle line:90%
we're supposed to do--

00:31:15.466 --> 00:31:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we're disclosing for
the first time on this program

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:24.037 align:middle line:84%
that the Secret Space Program
isn't paying its employees.

00:31:24.037 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: A vast number of them.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a vast number
of them are being

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.683 align:middle line:84%
told that they're going
to be paid, are told

00:31:28.683 --> 00:31:30.960 align:middle line:84%
going to be paid later,
going to be told that they're

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
going to get rotated back, get
a nice cushy job with a pension.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sue them.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I'm in a process
with my congressman's office

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
to get paperwork, to get
papers, to get documents.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And what should, at some
point, end up probably

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:48.750 align:middle line:90%
in a settlement.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But that's just going
to take a while.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It'll be
sealed, you know that?

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I'm
fine with that.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I really don't care if you
know they take me into a room

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.819 align:middle line:84%
and say, here, you
can look at this.

00:31:56.819 --> 00:31:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Here, we'll give you--

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here's your check.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --but you can't
ever talk about this.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine with that.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I understand the protocols
and I'm fine with that.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you must
be driving them crazy now.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Talking about this--

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I know that
some people are perfectly

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.196 align:middle line:84%
happy with what I'm
doing because they know

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:84%
it needs to be
discussed and they

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.790 align:middle line:84%
know that there's other
people who absolutely

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:90%
hate my guts for doing it.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.700 align:middle line:90%
So you know, whatever.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about Tony Rodriguez.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.662 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Nice guy.

00:32:21.662 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whistleblower?

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.828 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I've spoken to him.

00:32:23.828 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:84%
He seems like a
really nice guy and he

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:84%
has a way of recollecting
his version of events that

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:84%
seem incredibly
legitimate, to me,

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that recall events that
seem beyond his ability

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.390 align:middle line:90%
to fabricate them.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And certainly he has discussed
a few different things

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that I have also experienced
that make his recollections

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.584 align:middle line:84%
seem completely
legitimate to me.

00:32:46.584 --> 00:32:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll have
you verify what

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000 align:middle line:84%
we're about to see with Michael
Salla and Tony Rodriguez.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.755 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:32:52.755 --> 00:32:54.880 align:middle line:10%
>>TONY ROGRIGUES: But I
got lost and I saw two guys

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.910 align:middle line:10%
in a military uniform
but they were aliens.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:10%
One guy was like, I want
to say he looked like a cat

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:10%
but it wasn't the case.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.320 align:middle line:10%
He had coarse, orange hair.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
He was shorter and
stocky and he had--

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.220 align:middle line:90%
he was ugly looking.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.264 align:middle line:90%
He was ugly.

00:33:10.264 --> 00:33:12.430 align:middle line:10%
I really don't know how to
describe other than that.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:10%
He had hair.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.960 align:middle line:10%
And the other guy was smaller.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.400 align:middle line:10%
And he was more of a fish.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.995 align:middle line:10%
He had like a fish
eyes and a snout.

00:33:21.995 --> 00:33:22.870 align:middle line:10%
You know what I mean?

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:23.590 align:middle line:10%
And they were together.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.423 align:middle line:10%
And I walked-- because
they were in uniform,

00:33:25.423 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:10%
I thought that they were
in the army, like I was

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:30.990 align:middle line:10%
or whatever I was in.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:31.790 align:middle line:10%
The fleet.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:32.710 align:middle line:10%
I thought they were
part of the fleet.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.830 align:middle line:10%
So I asked them, I'm lost.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:34.871 align:middle line:10%
Can you guys help me out?

00:33:34.871 --> 00:33:37.030 align:middle line:10%
And they said--

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:10%
I had to wear a
collar, a slave collar,

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.180 align:middle line:10%
there was a correction collar.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:10%
And you would get electrified
if you were disciplined.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:46.870 align:middle line:10%
And they saw my collar
and he said, what are you

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:10%
doing talking to us?

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:48.446 align:middle line:10%
Don't even talk to us.

00:33:48.446 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:10%
How are you even out here?

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.994 align:middle line:10%
You don't have money.

00:33:50.994 --> 00:33:52.660 align:middle line:10%
And they were-- what
are you doing here?

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.370 align:middle line:84%
They immediately--
what makes you

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:90%
think we're going to help you?

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.750 align:middle line:10%
And it was a telepathic
communication.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.250 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I'm lost.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.514 align:middle line:10%
Can you just tell me how to
get back to the hangar area?

00:34:03.514 --> 00:34:05.680 align:middle line:10%
And they said you can't
even get to the hangar area.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:10%
Guys like, you don't
even have money.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.090 align:middle line:10%
I said, I've got money.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.350 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as I showed them
my money, the one punched me.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:10%
And they basically beat
me up and took my money.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:15.534 align:middle line:90%
I got mugged.

00:34:15.534 --> 00:34:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That sounds like
a legitimate experience.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does?

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It does,
it absolutely does.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.479 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, he
called the ET ugly.

00:34:22.479 --> 00:34:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Beauty is in the
eyes of the beholder.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:25.989 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They probably
thought he was ugly.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm sure
that they did, yeah,

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But these
things are happening

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:30.889 align:middle line:90%
the way he described it?

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:32.679 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I would suggest that.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:35.139 align:middle line:84%
One of the-- probably the
most interesting things

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that I got to do when I was
stationed on the Nautilus

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:84%
was go on to
diplomatic missions.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And diplomatic missions to the
intergalactic space station

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.980 align:middle line:84%
that orbits around Jupiter,
which is essentially

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:84%
a diplomatic meeting area
for hundreds of species

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:52.239 align:middle line:90%
and us and them.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many did you meet?

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.835 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Me personally,
I would say several dozen.

00:34:55.835 --> 00:34:56.635 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:34:56.635 --> 00:34:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the main meeting room
is this large room that's

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.850 align:middle line:84%
like, several hundred
meters wide with Florida

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:84%
ceilings probably, 70 or 80 feet
high with I want to say glass.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.659 align:middle line:84%
But it probably wasn't
silicon glass windows

00:35:09.659 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
that went all the
way around that you

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.300 align:middle line:90%
had this amazing view of.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.021 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
all look different?

00:35:14.021 --> 00:35:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: As varied
and different as

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:90%
you can possibly say.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I would say the smallest
extraterrestrial

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I ever saw was probably
about 18, 24 inches high

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and the largest one was
probably 60 feet tall.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 60 feet tall?

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah,
about 60 feet tall.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it look human?

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Humanoid in the
sense two arms, two legs--

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nose?

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: --bipedal.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.300 align:middle line:84%
You could certainly
identify it by looking at it

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.310 align:middle line:84%
but I wouldn't say that
it just looked like you

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:90%
or I 60 feet tall.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.410 align:middle line:84%
It had some other sort of
distinguishing features.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And would you say the
ETs were all benevolent or not?

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: In that particular
location, everyone who's there

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:53.080 align:middle line:84%
is there to have a
conversation about trade,

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.330 align:middle line:90%
contracts, negotiations.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So everyone's on
their best behavior.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's being nice.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.620 align:middle line:84%
It's usually not a bunch
of grunts arguing about.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It's diplomats.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:04.570 align:middle line:90%
It's officers.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:08.020 align:middle line:84%
It's people out of
various ambassadorial

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.060 align:middle line:84%
or diplomatic corps
having conversations.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.906 align:middle line:84%
So everyone's pretty
cordial there.

00:36:11.906 --> 00:36:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is pretty cordial.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:18.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Captain Cramer, do
you wake up sweating and upset?

00:36:18.765 --> 00:36:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I used to
have night terrors.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I used to.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.646 align:middle line:84%
I don't have them
so much anymore.

00:36:22.646 --> 00:36:25.369 align:middle line:84%
Lots of therapy has gotten
me to an OK place where I

00:36:25.369 --> 00:36:26.660 align:middle line:90%
can talk about a lot of things.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever gone
to psychiatric counseling?

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:30.455 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure, absolutely.

00:36:30.455 --> 00:36:31.970 align:middle line:90%
And I've gone to counseling.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I went to a psychiatrist
for a while.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Medication?

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.486 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Antidepressants,
anti-anxiety medication

00:36:39.486 --> 00:36:42.110 align:middle line:84%
for a little while to deal with
the depression and the anxiety,

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.097 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:36:43.097 --> 00:36:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You off that now?

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh yeah, for years.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
do you think come out

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%
of these programs the same way?

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would say
that most people come out

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of these programs having had
a series of experiences that

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:84%
have either shocked them,
traumatized them, or unnerved

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.140 align:middle line:84%
them in a way that
they're psychologically

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.330 align:middle line:90%
unsteady because of it.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a
certain amount of just

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:84%
going through some
kind of healing process

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.070 align:middle line:84%
to get to be able to where
you can feel stable again.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.736 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You served
in the Marine Corps.

00:37:12.736 --> 00:37:13.770 align:middle line:90%
You took an oath.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.060 align:middle line:90%
I served in the Navy.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:90%
I took an oath.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.745 align:middle line:84%
And we feel as if we've
done things for country.

00:37:18.745 --> 00:37:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think,
being in these programs,

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:84%
you've done something
for our country

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:27.365 align:middle line:90%
or do you feel used and abused?

00:37:27.365 --> 00:37:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I know
that my oath was

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.780 align:middle line:84%
to protect my
planet and my people

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:84%
from anything and everything
that could do it harm.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And so in that sense
I feel like I've

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.830 align:middle line:84%
done my job, that I did
what I was supposed to do.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I certainly feel
taken advantage by

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.640 align:middle line:84%
the bureaucratic's
in the system.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I feel that my military
commanders did their best

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.270 align:middle line:84%
to train me the best
that they could,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to treat me that the best they
could with respect and dignity

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and honor and that
they continue to do so.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But there is
definitely a disconnect

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.190 align:middle line:84%
between what certain military
personnel think should happen

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and what is OK and the
way to treat people

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.694 align:middle line:84%
and the way certain members of
the bureaucratic administrative

00:38:06.694 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:84%
part think that it's
OK to treat people.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a major
disconnect there for sure.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you have children?

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: None at this time.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:84%
If you did, would you
want them in this program?

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:20.531 align:middle line:90%


00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: That's a tough call.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, I
wouldn't necessarily

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.450 align:middle line:84%
want them to have
my experiences.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: On the
other hand, I would

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:34.000 align:middle line:84%
have to say that if that
was their destiny, to have

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to go through that,
then I would just

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.620 align:middle line:84%
want to be the best parent in
the world to try and support

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.110 align:middle line:84%
them in that process and their
recovery in that process.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you go through
what you went through again?

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Not voluntarily.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.765 align:middle line:90%
No, not voluntarily.

00:38:48.765 --> 00:38:50.056 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What if they take you?

00:38:50.056 --> 00:38:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: But at
the same time, I

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:53.890 align:middle line:84%
can't look back at
those experiences

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and say I wouldn't want them
as part of my life experience.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.460 align:middle line:84%
They make me who I
am and they certainly

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.230 align:middle line:84%
are the best and the
worst of everything

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.380 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever experienced.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.970 align:middle line:90%
So that's a tough one.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't necessarily
go back and say yeah,

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I volunteer to do this again.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.446 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't go back
and take it away either

00:39:10.446 --> 00:39:12.545 align:middle line:84%
because there's too much
value as a human being

00:39:12.545 --> 00:39:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that I've gained from
those experiences

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:15.109 align:middle line:90%
to want to undo them.

00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
your commanding officer

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.670 align:middle line:90%
say once he sees this interview?

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Would he go, right on, Randy.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.480 align:middle line:84%
You got the message out
that we wanted you to.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Or you said too much?

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.940 align:middle line:90%
What would he say?

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: He's made it very
clear that as the spokesperson

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:31.090 align:middle line:84%
it's my job to just speak
clearly and honestly

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and truthful.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And that it's not
up for anybody else

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.409 align:middle line:84%
to judge whether I'm doing
the right job or not.

00:39:37.409 --> 00:39:38.950 align:middle line:84%
The first couple of
interviews that I

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:84%
did, I remember discussing
this with him and asking him,

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.810 align:middle line:90%
you know did I do OK?

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:90%
And he kind of hemmed and hawed.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what?

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:48.750 align:middle line:90%
What did I not do?

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:51.220 align:middle line:84%
He's like, well, you kind
of softballed a little bit.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do
you mean I softballed?

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.950 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, you kind of--

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:84%
you went out there
not really being you.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, you mean
you want me to sort of curse

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and swear, yell and
scream some more?

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.979 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, well, if
that's you then be you.

00:40:04.979 --> 00:40:07.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't want you
to go out there and put

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.490 align:middle line:90%
on a presentation for people.

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go out there
and tell people the truth

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:10.910 align:middle line:90%
and be you.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like the first
couple of interviews

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that I did I was trying
to be a little stiffer--

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.950 align:middle line:90%


00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --and that
his only advice was

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:90%
to just loosen up and be you.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the more I
feel like I'm just

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:84%
being honest and being myself
than I'm doing the right thing.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
miss the program?

00:40:25.375 --> 00:40:28.667 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.667 --> 00:40:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Or does it feel good to be home?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oddly
enough, sometimes I do.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Oddly enough, sometimes I do.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:90%
There is a certain--

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
make friends there?

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, absolutely.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:44.220 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain certainty
about service in combat

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.650 align:middle line:84%
that makes your life black
and white and clear--

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:49.533 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: In certain ways.

00:40:49.533 --> 00:40:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I guess sometimes I
miss that because trying

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.080 align:middle line:84%
to be and navigate civilian life
is very cloudy and very gray

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.171 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always so clear
what you're supposed to do

00:40:59.171 --> 00:41:02.721 align:middle line:84%
or what the right thing to do is
or what choice A, B, C, D or E

00:41:02.721 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to take.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.360 align:middle line:84%
When you're serving
in a military unit,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.220 align:middle line:90%
it's much more clear.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.810 align:middle line:90%
You do this, you don't do this.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes I miss
that simplicity, sure.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:13.408 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say, Randy,

00:41:13.408 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:84%
what is your best experience
either on the Moon

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:84%
or on Mars that just was
so fulfilling for you?

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: We were actually--

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:31.050 align:middle line:84%
my squad and I were captured
by indigenous reptoids on Mars

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and spent 5 and 1/2
months living with them.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And I would--

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Captured?

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like, in
their not all friendly?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: We were in a constant
state of military combat with

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.340 align:middle line:90%
two indigenous species--

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.400 align:middle line:84%
an insect species and
a reptoids species.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Which then got more complicated
when the Draconian invasion

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.610 align:middle line:84%
occurred and then it was
a very complicated sort

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.530 align:middle line:90%
of war conflict.

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it violent?

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Very, very violent
on a very regular basis.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.209 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were in probably
active combat engagements

00:42:01.209 --> 00:42:02.250 align:middle line:90%
every three to four days.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did we lose personnel?

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: All the time.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And did they?

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: All the time.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.139 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
weaponry would we use?

00:42:11.139 --> 00:42:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: For soldiers
on the ground,

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:84%
our primary weaponry is a
magnetic propelled rifle

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.680 align:middle line:84%
or a Gauss gun or a rail gun
that fires out magnetically

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.710 align:middle line:90%
propelled slugs.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if it hits one
of these beings, what happens?

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Depending on
who it is or depending

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:32.580 align:middle line:84%
on the size of the slug, it
usually penetrates and goes

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.380 align:middle line:90%
right through them.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then kills them?

00:42:34.889 --> 00:42:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Doesn't necessarily
kill them right away, depending

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.080 align:middle line:90%
on their internal structure.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.260 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous reptoids had
a double circulatory system

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.530 align:middle line:84%
they had two hearts with what
I would call an internal organ

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:47.330 align:middle line:84%
circulatory system
and then a perimeter

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.632 align:middle line:90%
or external circulatory system.

00:42:49.632 --> 00:42:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So you could shoot holes
in their arms and legs

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and they wouldn't
lose blood pressure.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, they wouldn't
lose blood pressure

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:55.440 align:middle line:90%
in their central organs.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.827 align:middle line:90%
So you really had to aim for--

00:42:56.827 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:84%
you had to hit a couple
vitals in the central area

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:90%
before they would go down.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it's violent there.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Very.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Very.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not as
friendly as one would think.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: No, it's an
incredibly violent experience.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you meet
any ETs you liked?

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I said,
when we were captured

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.806 align:middle line:90%
and we actually were--

00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:84%
the whole purpose
wasn't you know

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.759 align:middle line:90%
to torture us for five months.

00:43:21.759 --> 00:43:23.300 align:middle line:84%
The whole purpose
was actually for us

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to live among them
for five months

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.130 align:middle line:84%
so that we could go back
with an experience to say,

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.362 align:middle line:90%
they're not all bad.

00:43:29.362 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And kind of have
this conversation.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
you live with them?

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: In a
subterranean community.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:90%
They all live underground there.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On the Moon or Mars?

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: On Mars.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On Mars.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.430 align:middle line:90%
In their craft?

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They have craft
but we didn't ever see them.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.240 align:middle line:90%
They didn't ever use them.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.830 align:middle line:84%
They had sort of chosen
to live in a state of what

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:50.332 align:middle line:84%
I would say is sort
of a more chosen

00:43:50.332 --> 00:43:52.790 align:middle line:84%
primitive state than what their
technology could allow them

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:55.929 align:middle line:84%
to do because they feel that
technology is what destroyed

00:43:55.929 --> 00:43:57.470 align:middle line:84%
their atmosphere
and nearly destroyed

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:58.980 align:middle line:90%
their planet in the first place.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they were trying to
live a little bit differently.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But I would also
say that that was

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:09.230 align:middle line:84%
specific to this
particular group, or tribe,

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:12.290 align:middle line:84%
this community that lived
in this particular area.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:16.160 align:middle line:84%
That if you went global with
the indigenous reptoids,

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.500 align:middle line:84%
they're not all on the
same page about that.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Depending on what
part of the planet

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.500 align:middle line:84%
you landed on or
engaged with them

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.040 align:middle line:84%
with would greatly
vary the experience

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.290 align:middle line:90%
that you would have with them.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you describe
what they look like?

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they looked like
a bipedal developed,

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.400 align:middle line:84%
what I would call,
sort of a rock lizard.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.364 align:middle line:84%
So not like a crocodile
or an alligator--

00:44:36.364 --> 00:44:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a gecko?

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Kind of, yeah.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they would
have a shorter snout--

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The insurance
company will love this one.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.734 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --have
a shorter snout.

00:44:43.734 --> 00:44:49.874 align:middle line:84%
They tend to have a reddish to
sandy colored skin or scales.

00:44:49.874 --> 00:44:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Walk upright?

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Would walk
upright on two legs.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But there is quite
a bit of variation

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.510 align:middle line:84%
in the patterning that can
show up on their scaling.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So they often would
have black, yellow, red,

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.615 align:middle line:84%
some very interesting
patterning on their scales.

00:45:02.615 --> 00:45:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you--

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would
say they height

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.140 align:middle line:84%
wise could vary from about 5 and
1/2 feet to almost 7 feet tall.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
they communicate?

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They
communicate verbally.

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.524 align:middle line:90%
They can speak.

00:45:14.524 --> 00:45:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are very
developed and they

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:17.240 align:middle line:90%
can communicate silently.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have
their own language?

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely, they do.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:23.596 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How was
their pitched voice?

00:45:23.596 --> 00:45:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would say again,
that depends on the heights,

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:26.990 align:middle line:90%
just like us.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.940 align:middle line:84%
A bigger person with
a bigger set of lungs

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.606 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a
deeper voice and is--

00:45:30.606 --> 00:45:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: (HIGH PITCHED)
Not necessarily.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: But I would say
that the main variation is

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:37.760 align:middle line:84%
in their tongue
and their palate.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So our tongue in our
pilot is a strong dictator

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.857 align:middle line:90%
in how our speech sounds.

00:45:41.857 --> 00:45:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Their tongue and their
palate is a strong dictator

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.650 align:middle line:90%
and how their language sounds.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're not as
benevolent as one would think?

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Doctor David Jacobs
may be correct

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:55.190 align:middle line:84%
when he says there's an evil
presence with some of these.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would
say some of them

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.332 align:middle line:84%
are more enlightened
than others.

00:46:00.332 --> 00:46:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Just like human beings, are
a little more enlightened

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:03.340 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.250 align:middle line:84%
But like everybody, they can
have an aggressive nature

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:07.050 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.675 align:middle line:84%
They can have a
warlike nature to them.

00:46:08.675 --> 00:46:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And you get into a
conflict with them

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and they can resort to their
primal angrier or selves

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.470 align:middle line:84%
just like we do in
a combat situation.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Some of the tribes are
definitely very warlike

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and if you met them, you'd
probably just be food

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.690 align:middle line:90%
if you couldn't win the fight.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They eat us?

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, sure.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So "The Twilight
Zone" show, To Serve Man,

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:28.850 align:middle line:90%
was correct?

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I mean they
certainly-- some of them

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:35.420 align:middle line:84%
see us as a completely
different species, a completely

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.530 align:middle line:90%
different type of animal.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we can certainly
be on the menu.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many bases
are there that we have?

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I would
say hundreds probably.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.780 align:middle line:84%
But I have no idea
the actual number.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scattered
all over the--

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.326 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, it would easily
hundreds if not thousands

00:46:48.326 --> 00:46:49.700 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't
give you a number.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.786 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about the ETs?

00:46:51.786 --> 00:46:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I would say more.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:55.490 align:middle line:84%
They probably have even
more bases and more stations

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:58.400 align:middle line:84%
than we do because
there's at least three

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.850 align:middle line:84%
or four intelligent
species that live on Mars.

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:03.810 align:middle line:84%
At least three or four
that I'm aware of.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:05.060 align:middle line:90%
I only met two of them though.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we concerned
that they're there?

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.152 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, we
can't get rid of them.

00:47:10.152 --> 00:47:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I wouldn't
say concerned.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.280 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
is the main purpose

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.490 align:middle line:84%
of continuing to engage in
military conflict is to test

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.740 align:middle line:90%
weaponry and to test tools.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So we certainly see
that as a testing ground

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.192 align:middle line:84%
for military
technology-- just get

00:47:26.192 --> 00:47:27.400 align:middle line:90%
better and better and better.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So in some ways, it's
just what we do there.

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's a perfectly
good testing ground

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:33.660 align:middle line:90%
for that material.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At this point, have
you seen some of their craft

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:90%
upfront and personal.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Not the
indigenous species on Mars.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I've seen other
extraterrestrial craft but not

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.470 align:middle line:84%
the indigenous species
who live on Mars.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are we still
recruiting people to go there?

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely
I mean, some people

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.180 align:middle line:84%
are engineered from the
ground up like myself

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and then parceled into a
program and then deployed.

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Some people are recruited
from covert black programs

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.370 align:middle line:90%
or other officer programs.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
requested or asked to

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and some people are
just told you're getting

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.810 align:middle line:90%
redeployed and get sent there.

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy Carson has
been on the "Deep Space" Gaia

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:18.759 align:middle line:84%
program and he talks
about recruitment.

00:48:18.759 --> 00:48:21.457 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:48:21.457 --> 00:48:23.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Obviously,
being recruited

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.590 align:middle line:10%
for missions such as
Randy Cramer was on

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:29.300 align:middle line:10%
would have to be difficult
to say the least.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.090 align:middle line:10%
How could they get
anyone to volunteer

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:33.262 align:middle line:10%
for such dangerous work?

00:48:33.262 --> 00:48:34.720 align:middle line:10%
>>BILLY CARSON: I
believe there are

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.640 align:middle line:10%
a lot of missing
people on this planet,

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.260 align:middle line:10%
thousands of people
documented are

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.770 align:middle line:10%
disappearing every single year.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:43.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's a book that came
out called "Alternative 003."

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:47.110 align:middle line:10%
And the third option
was to actually

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.720 align:middle line:10%
have a breakaway civilization
on another planet.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.800 align:middle line:10%
And in this plan, they
also needed to take people.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.590 align:middle line:10%
You had to have people in
specific industries-- doctors,

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:57.312 align:middle line:10%
you had to have
been farmers, you

00:48:57.312 --> 00:48:59.020 align:middle line:10%
had to have all
different types of people

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.540 align:middle line:10%
from all different
types of arenas

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.950 align:middle line:10%
so that you can actually
populate this new civilization

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:04.510 align:middle line:10%
and create the infrastructure.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.310 align:middle line:10%
Along with that,
it's very possible

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:10.210 align:middle line:10%
that they've used some type of
an MK Ultra or mind controlling

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:14.480 align:middle line:10%
device or even a serum
to convince people

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.010 align:middle line:10%
or to take people
off this planet.

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a story.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:19.852 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:49:19.852 --> 00:49:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that
happens all the time.

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you went out on
the streets today, Randy,

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and polled people and
told them your story,

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.620 align:middle line:90%
what do you think they'd say?

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It depends
on the person.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I certainly get
enough random people

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:36.020 align:middle line:84%
who want to give me a high five
and say, I totally believe you,

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Randy.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.095 align:middle line:84%
And I get occasional
hate mail from people who

00:49:40.095 --> 00:49:41.940 align:middle line:90%
think that I'm fraudulent too.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If Gaia paid
for it, would you

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:44.550 align:middle line:90%
take a polygraph test.

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: In a heartbeat.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would?

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Not only would
I take a polygraph test,

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.990 align:middle line:84%
you can give me a shot of
thiopental sodium in the arm

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and you can give me truth serum
and I'll take a polygraph test.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They may do this.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: In a heartbeat.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:56.310 align:middle line:90%
In a heartbeat.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I've offered that a
number of times but no one's

00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.400 align:middle line:90%
taken me up on it.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We can record the
results on the program?

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:02.823 align:middle line:84%
I've offered that a
number of times no one's

00:50:02.823 --> 00:50:05.454 align:middle line:84%
ever taken me up on it but
I'd do it in a heartbeat.

00:50:05.454 --> 00:50:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
be intriguing.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.161 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: In a heartbeat, yeah.

00:50:08.161 --> 00:50:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you
pass it, it tells us

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.759 align:middle line:90%
volumes about what's going on.

00:50:11.759 --> 00:50:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I got no
problem with that.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to do it.

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Happy to do it.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I've thrown that
gauntlet down for years

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:17.733 align:middle line:90%
and no one's picked it up.

00:50:17.733 --> 00:50:19.140 align:middle line:90%
So please, be the first.

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll get our
staff to work on this--

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Do it.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.541 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and see
when we can do it.

00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You live on the Oregon
side of the coast, right?

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I do.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we can get you
back and probably do it here.

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's a
short flight, yeah.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.738 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some great
law enforcement

00:50:30.738 --> 00:50:31.572 align:middle line:90%
polygraph examiners.

00:50:31.572 --> 00:50:33.613 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's what I've
heard, so let's do it.

00:50:33.613 --> 00:50:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:35.760 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:36.560 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And they'll analyze
you first and they'll

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:40.150 align:middle line:90%
say he's qualified to do it.

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Some people aren't.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm happy to do it.

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does this
program go now, in your opinion?

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's going to continue
to go on and on and on and on.

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.460 align:middle line:84%
What we understand one
of the other main reasons

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.610 align:middle line:84%
why we feel that
disclosure's fairly important

00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:59.500 align:middle line:84%
is this reason in
itself-- is because there

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:00.754 align:middle line:90%
are personnel shortfalls.

00:51:00.754 --> 00:51:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And as long as
there are personnel

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:05.800 align:middle line:84%
shortfalls that we have
to kidnap or force people

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.100 align:middle line:84%
into recruitment, we're
in that quasi slavery

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.230 align:middle line:84%
area, which violates
treaties that we've

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:13.150 align:middle line:90%
signed with other species.

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And we think the
most ethical way

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:18.670 align:middle line:84%
to go through with this is to
have a publicly aware program

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:20.567 align:middle line:90%
so that people can volunteer.

00:51:20.567 --> 00:51:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you right
now, I get enough

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:25.220 align:middle line:84%
e-mails from people who are
asking me how do I volunteer?

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.020 align:middle line:90%
How do I become--

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I'm surprised
that you even asked me that.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But there are
plenty of people who

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:34.150 align:middle line:84%
if you gave them the opportunity
to go into a recruiting center

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and say, sign me up, they
would sign up in a heartbeat.

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Travis Walton, of
course, from "Fire in the Sky,"

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:44.530 align:middle line:84%
who was zapped aboard
a craft a long time ago

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and was witnessed by
his logger buddies,

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.470 align:middle line:90%
all passed polygraph tests.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:50.350 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They all
passed polygraph tests.

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:54.490 align:middle line:84%
What does it tell you
about these stories?

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Because there are a number
of others out there like you

00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.960 align:middle line:84%
who don't say what
you just said,

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.900 align:middle line:90%
put me through a polygraph test.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:84%
What if they say, I
don't want to do it?

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.122 align:middle line:90%
What does that tell you?

00:52:07.122 --> 00:52:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Anyone who's
putting themselves

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:11.770 align:middle line:84%
in a gray area of not
willing to be scrutinized

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:13.810 align:middle line:84%
is going to make me
question whether they're

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.030 align:middle line:90%
being completely honest or not.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that anyone
who feels like they're

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.900 align:middle line:84%
coming from an honest
place shouldn't shy away

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.717 align:middle line:84%
from that kind of
scrutiny at all.

00:52:21.717 --> 00:52:23.800 align:middle line:84%
They should be more than
willing to be scrutinized

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.630 align:middle line:90%
if they're telling the truth.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think so,
without any doubt.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Without any doubt at all.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And coming from someone like
you who's been there before,

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.790 align:middle line:84%
would you say there are
a lot of people out there

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:41.740 align:middle line:84%
who are making this up or
jumping on this bandwagon?

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think there's a
complicated answer to that,

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:48.340 align:middle line:84%
which is from some of what
I understand and have heard

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.020 align:middle line:84%
some people talk
about their stories,

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I think you have a class of
people who are absolutely

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.920 align:middle line:84%
positively telling the truth
to the best of their ability.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I think you have some
people whose information may

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:04.150 align:middle line:84%
have been tampered with in their
own minds and their own brains.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they're telling
a version of events

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:08.890 align:middle line:84%
that other people
want them to tell.

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are other
people who have simply not gone

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:16.360 align:middle line:84%
through the personal memory
recovering process or healing

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.540 align:middle line:84%
process to get to true accurate
recollections of their memories

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.760 align:middle line:84%
so that they may simply be
recollecting things that

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.580 align:middle line:90%
are not completely accurate.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.430 align:middle line:84%
But I don't necessarily
think that it's intentional.

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's probably
one or two people that are just

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:31.690 align:middle line:90%
out and out might be lying.

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:33.310 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's--

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.040 align:middle line:84%
so far, most of
the people that I

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:40.600 align:middle line:84%
have seen who are talking about
this are putting themselves

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.970 align:middle line:84%
in a position of personal
risk, are putting themselves

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:44.831 align:middle line:84%
in a position of
not there's nobody--

00:53:44.831 --> 00:53:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And why
would they do that?

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And there's
nobody that I know who's

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:49.180 align:middle line:90%
making a bunch of money at it.

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So they're not doing
it for the money.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.020 align:middle line:90%
They're not doing it for--

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:56.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe if they're doing it for
a teeny little bit of fame

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.360 align:middle line:90%
that they might be getting.

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But most of them are
doing it because they

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:04.960 align:middle line:84%
feel like it's their
duty or part of them

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.620 align:middle line:84%
being a part of a truth
movement to tell the truth.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But again, whether they're
actually telling 100% the truth

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:14.110 align:middle line:84%
or not is not
necessarily up to them.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they just haven't gone
through a deep recollection

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:19.660 align:middle line:84%
process to get to
the absolute truth.

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that
the memory recovery

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.790 align:middle line:84%
process was long, arduous,
and complicated for me.

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And the main issue
is that you're

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:30.430 align:middle line:90%
facing traumatic memories.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And your brain
doesn't necessarily

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.293 align:middle line:90%
want to face traumatic memories.

00:54:33.293 --> 00:54:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you hit those
traumatic memories,

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:38.690 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that it wants to
do is steer you away from them.

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I can just
say that it took

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.450 align:middle line:84%
an intense amount
of personal will

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:46.330 align:middle line:84%
to just keep barreling
through each traumatic memory

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:48.860 align:middle line:84%
so that-- my mantra was I want
the truth, the whole truth,

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.150 align:middle line:90%
and nothing but the truth.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So help you God.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So that was what I got.

00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:55.010 align:middle line:84%
But some people maybe
haven't done that.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe their
brains haven't given them

00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:00.490 align:middle line:84%
the complete truth that they
should be telling the truth.

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm not accusing
anybody of fabricating anything

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:05.590 align:middle line:84%
on purpose or telling
lies on purpose

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:08.950 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't met or talked
to anyone who's doing that.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people I'm talking
to have either doing the best

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:15.610 align:middle line:84%
that they can to recollect
the truth or just

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:17.740 align:middle line:84%
might not have
gotten to the truth.

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases, may have
had their brains tampered with

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.892 align:middle line:84%
in order to tell a version
of events that is not

00:55:22.892 --> 00:55:24.850 align:middle line:84%
completely accurate but
that someone else wants

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:25.650 align:middle line:90%
them to tell.

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:29.489 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Captain Cramer, what
is the 20 and back program?

00:55:29.489 --> 00:55:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, they
basically figure

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.613 align:middle line:84%
that a tour of duty,
in order for them

00:55:32.613 --> 00:55:35.740 align:middle line:84%
to make all their money back,
requires a 20 year tour.

00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:38.944 align:middle line:84%
So a 20 year tour of
duty is essentially you--

00:55:38.944 --> 00:55:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A commitment
of 20 years?

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.776 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah,
you deploy someone

00:55:41.776 --> 00:55:45.160 align:middle line:84%
for a 20 year tour of duty
and then you return them.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And the return process--

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:51.800 align:middle line:84%
they do what is called
"age reversing."

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.800 align:middle line:84%
But it really has nothing
to do with that at all

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.850 align:middle line:84%
because the body that you're
in is pretty much so badly

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:00.640 align:middle line:84%
damaged that they have to
throw it in the trash bin.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.086 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After 20
years of space?

00:56:02.086 --> 00:56:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So from what I
understand, they basically

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:06.790 align:middle line:84%
have to hatch you out
a new clone that's

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:10.210 align:middle line:84%
the same age that when
you left and transfer

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:12.840 align:middle line:84%
your soul and your consciousness
through some complicated

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.840 align:middle line:90%
technological apparatus.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do that too?

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's a
quantum fluid dynamic.

00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:18.880 align:middle line:84%
From what I understand that
the soul is actually a quantum

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.620 align:middle line:84%
fluid dynamic and
so in that sense

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.750 align:middle line:84%
it can be removed from one
vessel and put into another.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:26.095 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I was
unconscious for the process

00:56:26.095 --> 00:56:27.580 align:middle line:90%
so I can't say how it was done.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it done to you?

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, absolutely.

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're in
a different body?

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet your soul and your
personality and everything--

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:36.610 align:middle line:90%
memory has all been transferred?

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure about
the soul being able to do that.

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Memory maybe.

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.466 align:middle line:84%
They may have that ability
to download and transfer.

00:56:44.466 --> 00:56:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, again,
my understanding

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.060 align:middle line:84%
is that the soul is a
quantum fluid dynamic

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and so being a
quantum fluid dynamic

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.610 align:middle line:84%
it can be quote unquote
"pumped from one vessel

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:55.990 align:middle line:90%
and put back into another."

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's not my area
so I couldn't tell you how

00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.060 align:middle line:90%
the science works behind that.

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.885 align:middle line:84%
But from the way I've
had it explained to me,

00:57:02.885 --> 00:57:03.760 align:middle line:90%
that's how it's done.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to your old body?

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Where is it now?

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: In the
incinerator I'm sure.

00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:09.619 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it bother you?

00:57:09.619 --> 00:57:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No, not really.

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it feel like you?

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It does.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as much as it
should be because I look--

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can I touch your hands?

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, sure.

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I look in the
mirror and I see--

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're human.

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:19.846 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --I see
me looking back.

00:57:19.846 --> 00:57:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So it feels like me as
much as it could be.

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:27.077 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this body
made in a laboratory?

00:57:27.077 --> 00:57:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: As near
as I can understand.

00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:30.529 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, hatched out of a clone.

00:57:30.529 --> 00:57:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Same with your
face and everything else?

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:34.230 align:middle line:84%
You were a total
clone of who you were?

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The physical
body absolutely, yeah.

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:39.064 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet you have
memory from your past.

00:57:39.064 --> 00:57:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Right, because
they take everything that's

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.110 align:middle line:84%
internal into the old body
and put it into the new one

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:46.625 align:middle line:90%
and you're just the same person.

00:57:46.625 --> 00:57:48.250 align:middle line:84%
You look in the
mirror, you're younger.

00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:49.750 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same you.

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.164 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Feels like "The
Island of Doctor Moreau."

00:57:52.164 --> 00:57:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's a
little weird sometimes.

00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:57.280 align:middle line:84%
If I think about it too
much, it will like twist

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.294 align:middle line:90%
my brain a little bit.

00:57:58.294 --> 00:57:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So I try not to think
about it too much.

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
difficult for you now

00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:05.620 align:middle line:84%
to have a relationship
because of all of this?

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It can be a strain.

00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It can be a strain.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you cry?

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I can have all kinds
of emotions about the process

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:15.970 align:middle line:90%
at different times.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also completely
OK with who I am.

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm completely OK with who I am.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm OK being in the
skin that I'm in.

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm OK having my
experiences that I've had.

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.524 align:middle line:84%
I'm OK knowing that I have
to live my life the way

00:58:29.524 --> 00:58:30.690 align:middle line:90%
that I have to live my life.

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:31.720 align:middle line:90%
So I'm OK with me.

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.178 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
would do it again?

00:58:33.178 --> 00:58:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And anybody who's
not OK with me, that's

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:36.850 align:middle line:90%
their problem but not mine.

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you'd do it
again, this same program?

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again, not necessarily
by choice but at the same time

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't undo the
experiences that I've had.

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.751 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
it's happened to you?

00:58:45.751 --> 00:58:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:51.676 align:middle line:84%
Or would you prefer
that it never did?

00:58:51.676 --> 00:58:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I kind of
have to think of it

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:58.930 align:middle line:84%
like my tour of duty is like
a giant crap milkshake filled

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:01.420 align:middle line:84%
with crap up to here with
whipped cream and a cherry

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:02.320 align:middle line:90%
on top.

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.030 align:middle line:90%
And so I had to go through--

00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:06.280 align:middle line:84%
finish off a whole
crap milkshake.

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But then at the end, there was
this whipped cream and cherry

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.596 align:middle line:84%
on the top that kind
of almost makes it

00:59:11.596 --> 00:59:13.970 align:middle line:84%
worth it that I just wouldn't
want to trade anything for.

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:16.087 align:middle line:90%
So I just accept both with that.

00:59:16.087 --> 00:59:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Accept the good and
the bad with that.

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:20.666 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the title
of your upcoming book?

00:59:20.666 --> 00:59:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: We haven't secured
the ISBN number for it

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:25.790 align:middle line:84%
yet so I'm keeping it under my
hat until we're actually done.

00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:27.220 align:middle line:90%
But it will be--

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when we're going to
air this but from today's date,

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:34.380 align:middle line:84%
it should be any time within
the next couple of months.

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's on this
subject matter obviously.

00:59:36.505 --> 00:59:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh it's the
volume one of three

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that is going to be my
memoirs, which will basically

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:42.595 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: So you're going
public in a big way?

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:46.573 align:middle line:10%
And I've been working on--

00:59:46.573 --> 00:59:48.970 align:middle line:10%
I've been told that I should
work on it for the last six

00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:51.370 align:middle line:10%
years and it's just been
such a traumatic process

00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:54.160 align:middle line:10%
to sit down and try and
write the experiences

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.790 align:middle line:10%
that it's just been a back and
forth, back and forth process.

00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of
had to end up in

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:04.370 align:middle line:84%
my own psychological emotional
basement to be able to do it.

>>NOORY: And you're ready?

01:00:05.965 --> 01:00:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Captain, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, thank you.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:09.680 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me, George.

01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I appreciate it.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: My pleasure.

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:14.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He says he'll
take a polygraph test

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.210 align:middle line:10%
if offered to him.

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:18.800 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing
moment that would

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.490 align:middle line:90%
be if he takes it and passes.

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
