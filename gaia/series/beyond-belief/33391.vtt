00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.622 align:middle line:90%
life experiences.

Please welcome John St.
Augustine [applause].

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:02.762 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.799 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Good to see you.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.667 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What the
heck happened to you twice?

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.835 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Oh, boy.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.004 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're 19
and you're bulletproof,

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.706 align:middle line:84%
that's when the universe
sends a lot of the messages

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.107 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
learn some things.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:19.079 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I was 19 years old, I was
working at a small drug store,

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.881 align:middle line:84%
bailing boxes, working
part-time,

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:84%
my way through school, and
I was putting these boxes

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.953 align:middle line:84%
in on January 19, 1978,
10 o'clock at night --

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember it all clearly -- and
I closed the machine and I went

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.993 align:middle line:84%
to press the button on the
back and there's a nice star --

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:35.562 align:middle line:84%
scar on my thumb where the
electricity went through

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:38.765 align:middle line:84%
and melted my hand and that was
it -- 550 volts for about...

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.833 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Ouch!

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:40.867 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
...15-20 seconds.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.802 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. The big -- the
big thick chords.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.104 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Were
you locked on it?

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.138 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I could not get off.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:46.238 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Or
did it throw you?

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:47.607 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
It had me locked on

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.109 align:middle line:84%
and I had closed the door, so
I had a nice circuit going.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.045 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that saved me was
I was wearing rubber soled shoes

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:55.148 align:middle line:84%
on cement and I was somehow
able to get my left hand off,

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.017 align:middle line:90%
it threw it me to the floor.

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.919 align:middle line:84%
Half my hand was
stuck on the wall,

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.086 align:middle line:90%
the other half on the machine.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:00.921 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oww.

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:02.022 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Pretty --

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:02.556 align:middle line:84%
pretty difficult stuff,
but I had no pulse.

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:03.823 align:middle line:90%
I was done.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:07.993 align:middle line:84%
I was out, and coincidentally
-- synchronistically,

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:10.664 align:middle line:84%
the pharmacist happened
to stay late that night

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.966 align:middle line:84%
and he was a Vietnam
vet who was a medic.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.968 align:middle line:84%
He knew exactly what
to do to revive me,

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
but as this was happening, I
was watching it happen, just,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.341 align:middle line:90%
kind of, right above it.

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:22.375 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Floating above, huh?

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.009 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:90%
It was very weird.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.177 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm from Chicago.

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't even put ketchup on
our hotdogs, so this was way --

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.684 align:middle line:84%
way out of my comfort zone
at 19 years old, so I came to

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:32.352 align:middle line:84%
and this guy -- I was
watching this guy sitting

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.254 align:middle line:84%
on my chest pounding
my chest saying John,

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:36.823 align:middle line:90%
John, wake up, and I did.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.692 align:middle line:84%
And I had this immediate,
kind of,

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:41.127 align:middle line:90%
vacuum cleaner whoosh feeling

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:43.129 align:middle line:84%
and I was watching
this guy pounding on me

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.432 align:middle line:84%
and I thought what are you
doing sitting on my chest,

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:46.533 align:middle line:84%
even though I had
already seen it.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:47.534 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:48.768 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Coincidentally,

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
the fire department was
driving right past the store

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.438 align:middle line:90%
when it happened.

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:52.305 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, they
had all kinds

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.873 align:middle line:90%
of equipment to help burns.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
They took me to the same
hospital I was born in and I was

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.677 align:middle line:84%
up on the seventh
floor of the burn unit,

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.747 align:middle line:84%
I had pretty bad burns on my
hands, and it was all kind

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:04.584 align:middle line:84%
of melted together and I stayed
in there for a few weeks.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I kept having these recurring
thoughts about what happened,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.823 align:middle line:84%
and this isn't part
of my plan, you know,

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:10.924 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to go
to ball games.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.325 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You didn't ask for this.

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.227 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: Oh, no,
no, nobody signs up for this,

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.562 align:middle line:90%
but I believe that I did.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.297 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Had he not been there,
would you have been here?

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.398 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine:

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:18.932 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be sitting
here talking to you.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.066 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.468 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I'm pretty sure of that.

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.003 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was pretty obvious to
me that what happened to me --

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:24.638 align:middle line:84%
later on when they
took the machine apart,

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.773 align:middle line:84%
there was a major
electrical malfunction,

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.241 align:middle line:84%
and there were a lot of
young ladies working there

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.809 align:middle line:84%
and they said if they
had touched it --

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.177 align:middle line:84%
you know, half my size, they
would have never made it off.

00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:34.614 align:middle line:84%
So, it went exactly how
it was supposed to go.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.583 align:middle line:84%
I started to learn
early the difference

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:39.052 align:middle line:84%
between an accident
and an incident.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.087 align:middle line:84%
Accidents are things
that happen to you,

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.355 align:middle line:84%
incidents are things
that go through you.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.456 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Exactly.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:45.525 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Was there any pain
involved here, John?

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:46.259 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: No pain.

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.294 align:middle line:90%
Nothing at all.

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.095 align:middle line:84%
Not until after I
came back to my body

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.063 align:middle line:90%
that my hand hurt like...

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.264 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did you want
to come back?

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.199 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
It wasn't even a thought.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.266 align:middle line:90%
It was just like you're out,

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:55.068 align:middle line:84%
you're watching it,
it's like a movie...

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.202 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You have no control.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:57.137 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
and then you're back.

00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:57.903 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. It's just like
you're back.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:59.105 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any voices.

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:00.106 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hear anybody say
John, it's time to go.

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:01.207 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:02.042 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
None of that stuff.

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:03.176 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Don't go into the light.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Do not go to the light.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.111 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.146 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: No, none
of that, and it was just there,

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:07.213 align:middle line:84%
and, of course there
was a lot of pain

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:08.515 align:middle line:84%
and if anybody's ever
experienced burns,

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:10.183 align:middle line:84%
they're just really, really
difficult to deal with --

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
a lot of infection and things,
but a profound lesson came

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.122 align:middle line:84%
out of that experience
-- quite a few.

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.491 align:middle line:84%
But the big one was about
two weeks after I was

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.161 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital they gave
me these little sponges

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.229 align:middle line:84%
with like bristles on one side
and the sponge on the other,

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.464 align:middle line:84%
and you put water on
them and you clean.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.899 align:middle line:84%
You've got to clean
all the dead skin.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:26.666 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Skin.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.467 align:middle line:90%
You've got to take it off

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:28.168 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:29.002 align:middle line:90%
In order for it to heal.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:29.836 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Like a callous remover.

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:30.603 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Exactly.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.438 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, and it's not fun.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.006 align:middle line:90%
I don't prescribe it to anybody,

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.774 align:middle line:84%
but it was what I
had to go through.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.077 align:middle line:84%
And a girl that had graduated
a couple years earlier than me

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:40.413 align:middle line:84%
in high school -- I was 19
at the time, she was a nurse

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:43.149 align:middle line:84%
at the same hospital and
we kind of knew each other,

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.186 align:middle line:84%
but she showed up just on time,
she helped me clean my wounds

00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:48.054 align:middle line:84%
and she walked out
and I liked it

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.689 align:middle line:90%
because she was really pretty.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.725 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm like, I'll sit here
for a year and do this...

00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:53.059 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.194 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: ...if
that's what you want to do,

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:55.595 align:middle line:84%
but eventually she said
to me something profound

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:57.931 align:middle line:84%
that was not just about that,
but it was about my whole life

00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:01.368 align:middle line:84%
and our lives, and she said, the
moment you take responsibility

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:04.504 align:middle line:84%
for the pain is the moment
you'll begin to really heal.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:05.171 align:middle line:90%
And so...

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.473 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Interesting.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.173 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: ...I
had to scrub my own wounds

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.541 align:middle line:90%
and then I've learned --

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:11.945 align:middle line:84%
my belief is, my thought is
over my lifetime that once we --

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.347 align:middle line:84%
life is going to squeeze
us all, but once we learn

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility
for that --

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.252 align:middle line:84%
not the process of what's
happening, but what's going

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:21.388 align:middle line:84%
through us, things begin
to shift dramatically.

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.089 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to be shocked.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.391 align:middle line:90%
Apparently, I did, but.

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:26.192 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: At that point do you
have a different outlook?

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.093 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Not at 19.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.194 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: About what...

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:28.962 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Are you kidding me?

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:30.163 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I didn't think so.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:30.697 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
How much money can I get?

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.698 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:32.399 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I bought a car.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:33.366 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I mean, I got a...

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.701 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Little insurance
settlement.

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.002 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah,
they didn't want me to sue,

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.604 align:middle line:84%
it was a major company -- I
could probably say it now,

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:39.439 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really matter now,
they're based in the mid-west,

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.107 align:middle line:84%
and I remember going
to the hearing

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:43.543 align:middle line:84%
and they assigned a money
amount to my digits --

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.879 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of see where
this stuff had happened,

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.214 align:middle line:84%
they assigned how much each
of my fingers was worth,

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:50.517 align:middle line:84%
and it was just enough
to buy a '69 Z28.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.483 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: How about that.

00:05:51.483 --> 00:05:52.519 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I loved it.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.486 align:middle line:84%
I thought this is a
good -- I'm alive.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you still
have that car?

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.522 align:middle line:90%
You should have kept it.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:56.356 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: Oh,
I wish I could have kept it.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.357 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You should have kept it.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.425 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
No, I didn't.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:05:59.259 align:middle line:84%
I traded it for a
motorcycle and, like,

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:00.126 align:middle line:90%
two cases of beer, or something.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:01.327 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember [laughter].

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:02.128 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you still have
the scars on your hand.

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.229 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.431 align:middle line:84%
You can see them on my
hand, here and here,

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.832 align:middle line:84%
and here's where I pressed
the button right here.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Hold your hand up to that
camera right there, you know,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.901 align:middle line:90%
just take a picture of that.

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:09.235 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
My fingers aren't

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:11.404 align:middle line:84%
in very good shape, and what
happened was, if you look --

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:13.606 align:middle line:84%
none of you get to look, but
people close to me get to look,

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.809 align:middle line:84%
there's lines all
through my body

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:16.943 align:middle line:84%
where the electricity
bounced around --

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:18.445 align:middle line:84%
these little white --
it leaves scar marks.

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:22.081 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So, it really was a
bizarre interesting thing

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.585 align:middle line:84%
I really try not to wear any
jewelry or watches since then,

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:26.786 align:middle line:84%
because it kind of
freaks me out.

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:30.857 align:middle line:84%
They had to cut the cross
out of my chest, and...

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:32.091 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.026 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Just not a good experience.

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Feel like
a human antennae.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
It really was, you know,

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.996 align:middle line:84%
and at the time -- this
was 1979, so Lee Majors was

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:38.298 align:middle line:84%
on with the  Six
Million Dollar Man ...

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:39.666 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:40.366 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: ...so
they gave me a shirt, you know,

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.034 align:middle line:90%
powered by, you know...

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:42.035 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Exactly.

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:42.836 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
And it was --

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:43.903 align:middle line:90%
and I started to realize too

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.739 align:middle line:84%
about the energetic
part of our bodies.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.876 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're all energy
-- that's the bottom line.

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.244 align:middle line:84%
We're all -- our
batteries go up and down,

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.545 align:middle line:84%
depending on how we
feed that charge.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:53.913 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That energy.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.548 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: And for
weeks and weeks after that,

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:58.451 align:middle line:84%
I could do -- even though
my hand was in bad shape,

00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.786 align:middle line:90%
I like, knew everything.

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.054 align:middle line:84%
I knew when the phone
was going to ring.

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:02.021 align:middle line:84%
I knew what my mom
was going to make

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:03.356 align:middle line:84%
for dinner two days
later, you know.

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:04.891 align:middle line:90%
Really, really something.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And that stayed with me
for about six, eight months

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and just, kind of, slowly,
you know, dropped off

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.798 align:middle line:84%
and I really think
that there's something

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:15.235 align:middle line:84%
to the Frankenstein
concept of electricity...

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:15.935 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.036 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine:

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:17.737 align:middle line:84%
...and electricity going
through our bodies.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:18.538 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Jump starts you.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:19.239 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Sure.

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:19.939 align:middle line:90%
I don't recommend it.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.274 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Not like that.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.876 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: No,
but that was really something.

00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:25.678 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That was near death
experience number one.

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:26.746 align:middle line:90%
You had another one.

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:28.114 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I was 19 years old

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
when the first one happened
and eight years later, I'm 27.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.419 align:middle line:84%
I had just gotten married,
starting a new life.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.057 align:middle line:84%
Working -- running heavy
equipment with my John name

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:40.827 align:middle line:84%
over my shirt pocket and a
step increase every six months

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.629 align:middle line:84%
and playing softball
on Friday's,

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:90%
and drinking on Saturday.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.898 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Life is good, right?

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:46.399 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: Oh, I
had it all made, and two weeks

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.167 align:middle line:84%
after we got married,
we were driving

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.036 align:middle line:90%
out to a village near Chicago.

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.639 align:middle line:84%
I was off on that
particular Monday

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.841 align:middle line:84%
and it was a four-day work
week, and we went out --

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:55.909 align:middle line:84%
let's go get the
wedding pictures.

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
This is great, we're
having a good time.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.412 align:middle line:84%
Pick up the wedding
pictures, we're coming back

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:02.048 align:middle line:90%
and we come to a T intersection.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.583 align:middle line:84%
Traffic north and
south is stopped.

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.485 align:middle line:84%
I'm driving a 1983
Pontiac Firebird --

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.854 align:middle line:84%
not the biggest of cars,
and I'm getting ready

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.722 align:middle line:84%
to make a left-hand turn to
go north to eventually get

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.791 align:middle line:84%
on the highway to go
back into Chicago,

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:15.562 align:middle line:84%
and out of nowhere comes
wakeup call number two.

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:18.031 align:middle line:84%
Drunk driver -- Lincoln
Continental --

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:20.066 align:middle line:84%
60 miles an hour
-- ran the light.

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.301 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Like a tank.

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:22.569 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: Like
a tank, and hit me right

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:24.837 align:middle line:84%
at the door seam,
like right here.

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:27.507 align:middle line:84%
And it hurt -- that
hurt -- that one hurt.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:28.641 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That one hurt.

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:29.742 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
And the car, basically,

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:32.344 align:middle line:84%
folded into a V. It
spun around three times.

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:90%
He kept going.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.113 align:middle line:90%
Horrifying screeching, metal,

00:08:35.113 --> 00:08:36.849 align:middle line:84%
concrete kind of
stuff, you know.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.217 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Sound that stays
in your mind forever.

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:39.519 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Yeah, you know, that --

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
the smell of burnt flesh and
the screeching of concrete

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:84%
with metal -- not two of my
biggest favorite experiences.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.792 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: And I was
out for a second and I came to

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.296 align:middle line:84%
and I remember my wife, at the
time, running down the street

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:54.701 align:middle line:84%
and I saw our wedding
pictures spinning down...

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.736 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Just going
all over the place.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:57.704 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Just sprayed out,

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.505 align:middle line:84%
and people horrified
watching this

00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:01.708 align:middle line:90%
in the cars at the stoplight.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.244 align:middle line:84%
And a woman came
over and, you know,

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.578 align:middle line:84%
they talk about how
the windshields

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:84%
on the cars are supposed
to shatter.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.481 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen to this one.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.283 align:middle line:84%
My right hand -- you
can't see, you can kind

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.884 align:middle line:84%
of see this scar a little bit,
cut this artery right here.

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:12.952 align:middle line:84%
Went right through
the windshield.

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:14.254 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That hand has
had some abuse, huh?

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:14.887 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
It's taken some beating.

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:15.421 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:16.723 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Geez.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: You
know I can't play the piano.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.892 align:middle line:84%
I never could, but I
really can't play it now.

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.561 align:middle line:84%
But my hand went through
the window and it cut this

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and the blood was doing the
whole watering the yard kind

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.666 align:middle line:84%
of thing, and this woman
showed up at the door,

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:29.135 align:middle line:84%
and my knees went through the
dashboard, I, you know, --

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:30.803 align:middle line:84%
the steering wheel
went into my chest.

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.205 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty tough.

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:35.274 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of room there to move
around in those little cars,

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and this woman came to the door
and she pushed the window in

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.845 align:middle line:90%
and she was wearing all white,

00:09:38.845 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and I thought oh,
she's an angel.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.981 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:42.949 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: She was a
nurse who has just got off duty.

>> GN: She might
have been an angel.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.018 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
She could have been,

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:45.718 align:middle line:84%
and I don't discount
it to this day.

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:46.953 align:middle line:90%
I remember her name --

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:48.354 align:middle line:84%
Cassie White, if you're
still alive, God bless you.

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:50.923 align:middle line:84%
She came up and felt my pulse
and said I think you're going

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:54.627 align:middle line:84%
to be okay, but you need to
pray, and then I was out.

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.095 align:middle line:90%
That was all I remember.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:59.165 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Reminds me of a few
weeks ago of an accident.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:00.133 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
With the priest.

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:00.967 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: With the priest
in Missouri.

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:02.035 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yes, yes.

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:03.536 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And they finally
found the priest.

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.805 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I'm not sure it was him.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.441 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I mean how could
you have an accident scene.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.776 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And this is where a
priest showed up on an accident

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.779 align:middle line:84%
where a woman was
trapped in her car.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.215 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get her out,
and he prayed with her...

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:17.583 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.052 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: ...and the -- and the
police department saying she'll

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:20.653 align:middle line:90%
be okay-- she'll be okay.

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:21.854 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:23.222 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And he was gone,
and nobody could find him.

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:26.826 align:middle line:84%
They took 80 pictures
of the accident scene...

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.027 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
He was nowhere.

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.996 align:middle line:84%
And they had closed the
highway off, as I recall.

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:30.663 align:middle line:90%
So, how did he get there?

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:31.431 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:32.331 align:middle line:90%
How did he get in and out?

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.533 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely bizarre.

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:37.437 align:middle line:84%
So these two experiences
with you, did what to you?

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:38.604 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Well,

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:40.373 align:middle line:84%
they made me realize
this isn't the beginning.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:42.075 align:middle line:90%
It's the middle and not the end.

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:43.443 align:middle line:90%
How we experience our lives.

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:48.047 align:middle line:84%
You know, when that happened
and I was out, the paramedics

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.482 align:middle line:84%
that showed up on the
scene, I knew all of them

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.584 align:middle line:84%
and they had covered me
with the black body bag,

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and then once again,
here I was going,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.388 align:middle line:90%
oh here's a new movie for John.

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:56.756 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:57.523 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: One I'm
not liking this time either,

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:58.491 align:middle line:90%
but what's going on here,

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.892 align:middle line:84%
and this was far
more hypersensitive.

00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:02.562 align:middle line:84%
I could -- it was like I
had radar for 25 miles.

00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:04.163 align:middle line:84%
I knew what somebody was
cooking over hearing a dog,

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:06.432 align:middle line:84%
and I could hear, and it
was actually really cool,

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:09.268 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't worth the
price of admission..

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:10.536 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: No.

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:11.804 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: ...the
second time [laughter].

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.206 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: St. Augustine: This
was closer to real dying.

00:11:13.206 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: This was
really, really something and --

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.475 align:middle line:84%
and I thought to myself
what is this all about.

00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:16.943 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, again,
no big light experience.

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:19.412 align:middle line:84%
It was just like you have work
to do and you're not done and --

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:22.548 align:middle line:84%
and you'll know what
that is as life unfolds.

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:24.917 align:middle line:84%
And by the time --
and I could watch --

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:28.488 align:middle line:84%
what I felt, most
importantly, was huge empathy

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:30.256 align:middle line:84%
for these guys working
to get me out.

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.792 align:middle line:84%
I could feel so deeply
what they felt...

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:33.993 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.328 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Even though I didn't feel

00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:36.696 align:middle line:84%
that during the day when I
worked with some of these guys,

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.664 align:middle line:84%
and I had this huge empathy
for these men that were crying

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:39.732 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, because they
knew who was in there.

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You could hear voices?

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.201 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: They
could not get me out of there.

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.636 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And, I mean, I
get goose bumps thinking

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:45.071 align:middle line:90%
about it all these years later.

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I was back in the bag
-- once they got the door opened

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.243 align:middle line:84%
and the bag was over
me, I sat up,

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:52.445 align:middle line:84%
and I scared the you
know what out of them.

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:53.579 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:54.547 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
And I got out of the car

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:55.614 align:middle line:84%
and I said I'm going
to walk home.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:58.251 align:middle line:84%
It's 35 miles -- 20
miles, but I was...

00:11:58.251 --> 00:11:59.252 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Spurred you on.

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:00.586 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Yeah, you know.

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:01.554 align:middle line:84%
It's just a mess, and --
well, we're going to take you

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.955 align:middle line:90%
to the hospital first.

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:84%
They wrapped me up, took me to
the hospital, and I went home

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.825 align:middle line:84%
that night, which
was really amazing...

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.059 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Bizarre.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.327 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
...considering the injuries,

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.396 align:middle line:84%
but that didn't leave me
quick like the first one did.

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:14.567 align:middle line:84%
I knew somewhere, somehow there
was something more for me to do

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.068 align:middle line:84%
than what I was presently
experiencing.

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.671 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: And
if this voice was true,

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.874 align:middle line:84%
eventually it would show itself,
and it really shifted my life.

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:23.409 align:middle line:84%
I thought, it's great
to run heavy equipment,

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.911 align:middle line:84%
but I'm being asked
to do something else,

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.712 align:middle line:84%
which I hadn't done radio,
hadn't written books,

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:29.782 align:middle line:84%
hadn't done 99% of what I
would go on to do in life,

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:33.886 align:middle line:84%
and I really believe, for my
own blueprint, that this the --

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.755 align:middle line:90%
this was setup just that way.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.891 align:middle line:84%
It took years, George, for
me to forgive that guy.

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:41.227 align:middle line:84%
Years. I didn't get a
new car out of that one.

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:42.361 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I don't blame you.

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:43.196 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
But, you know, the guy,

00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:44.263 align:middle line:90%
he was an alcoholic, I think,

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.999 align:middle line:84%
but also empathy was
the rule of the day.

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:49.869 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: They say it's
a very important way

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:51.471 align:middle line:90%
for you to forgive.

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:53.773 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Well, it is, and life...

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.041 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I'm not sure
I can do that.

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:55.875 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Well it's,

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.543 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's very difficult.

00:12:57.543 --> 00:13:00.646 align:middle line:84%
It goes against every human
part of us, but the being part

00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:03.416 align:middle line:84%
of us is saying this
ain't it, and we're going

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:84%
to keep throwing
stuff in your way

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.451 align:middle line:90%
until you learn these things.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.453 align:middle line:84%
And, empathy opens so
many doors, and sympathy,

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:08.421 align:middle line:90%
and forgiveness I can't begin --

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:09.689 align:middle line:84%
it took eight years
to forgive him.

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Eight years.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.994 align:middle line:84%
And I wasted eight years
focusing on the guy,

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:16.462 align:middle line:84%
rather than the accident,
not the incident.

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.296 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely.

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:18.231 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: You know,

00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:19.532 align:middle line:84%
there was a reason
this man drank.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
There was a reason
he acted that way.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.469 align:middle line:84%
He did me a favor,
in the long run,

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.271 align:middle line:84%
but it took me years
to see that.

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:26.639 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: John St. Augustine
with us.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.774 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
from you

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:30.476 align:middle line:90%
on his near death experiences.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.612 align:middle line:90%
Anybody have any questions?

00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:33.379 align:middle line:90%
Yes, mam.

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Jessica: Hi.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.414 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Morning.

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:36.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Jessica: My name's Jessica.

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:38.251 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering, what did
you do to change your life

00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
after your second
accident and have --

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.522 align:middle line:84%
has what you changed
helped other people,

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:45.024 align:middle line:90%
and what can we learn from it?

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.392 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Oh, yeah.

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:49.762 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's ego, which
is like I'm running the show,

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:51.764 align:middle line:84%
and then, eventually
the ego gets ground

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:54.333 align:middle line:84%
down over a lifetime, and little
things, like car accidents,

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.502 align:middle line:84%
electrocutions --
you start to listen

00:13:56.502 --> 00:14:00.439 align:middle line:84%
and I think the universe is
always sending us opportunities

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:03.376 align:middle line:84%
to get out of that --
little and -- big and small.

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:06.746 align:middle line:84%
It could be something as simple
as moving out of the way in line

00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:09.115 align:middle line:84%
at a supermarket -- do they
call them supermarkets anymore?

00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:09.916 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I do.

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.284 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Okay.

00:14:11.284 --> 00:14:13.352 align:middle line:84%
They -- little as lines, like,
you know what you go first,

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.422 align:middle line:84%
and instead of just all
about me, and when it's --

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:19.592 align:middle line:84%
when you realize it's not just
about me but it's about we.

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
When you really, really
start to get that, you know,

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.963 align:middle line:84%
when you travel and you spend
time and you get to talk

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:26.332 align:middle line:84%
with people, you really get
a sense of the we and not me,

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:29.302 align:middle line:84%
and the more you get into the we
and less of me, then you start

00:14:29.302 --> 00:14:32.171 align:middle line:84%
to understand that there's
bigger things for us to do,

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:35.775 align:middle line:84%
and so those accidents --
incidents that were disguised

00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:38.311 align:middle line:84%
as accidents, I really
understand that both

00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:41.881 align:middle line:84%
of those were setup for me to
get to we and get out of me.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.015 align:middle line:90%
And then you can do the work

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.417 align:middle line:84%
that you're supposed
to do in the world.

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:50.089 align:middle line:84%
I just really -- I'm really
stubborn, and I'm a Neanderthal,

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:52.224 align:middle line:84%
knuckle-dragger from
the mid-west at heart,

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.327 align:middle line:84%
but I also realize that that
what setup for me to get

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:56.195 align:middle line:90%
out in a way that's for me.

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:57.563 align:middle line:90%
Yours is going to be different.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:01.233 align:middle line:84%
I always say to people,
whoever invented the alarm clock

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.601 align:middle line:90%
was brilliant.

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.204 align:middle line:84%
Whoever put a snooze button
on was an idiot, and so we --

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.473 align:middle line:84%
in life we have these alarm
clocks going off all the time --

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:10.042 align:middle line:84%
car accidents, whatever --
we're going to talk about some

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.444 align:middle line:84%
of these other thing
I've experienced,

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:12.511 align:middle line:90%
those are the wakeup calls.

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:13.512 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed
to go back to sleep.

00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:15.047 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to stay away,

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:16.682 align:middle line:84%
but we usually hit
the snooze button.

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:90%
You ever had that?

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:90%
You hit the snooze button.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.285 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And go back to sleep.

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:20.219 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
What's the point

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:22.188 align:middle line:84%
of having an alarm
clock, you know.

00:15:22.188 --> 00:15:25.658 align:middle line:84%
So, our life is like these alarm
clocks constantly going off.

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:28.661 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention, stay awake, if
you don't life will wake you

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:32.498 align:middle line:84%
up again and I think the knocks
get louder, the less we listen.

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:33.532 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:34.033 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes.

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:34.834 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:36.235 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Good.

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I guess, John you were in
no rush not to come back, right?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.141 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: No rush.

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:46.145 align:middle line:84%
No rush. It's a different
feeling.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.981 align:middle line:84%
Go back to the sympathy thing
and you can call it love,

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:51.984 align:middle line:84%
you can call it whatever you
want, but that is so pervasive,

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:53.085 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you've
talked to people

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.286 align:middle line:90%
who have the same experiences.

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:57.289 align:middle line:84%
This -- it's the oneness
we're all looking for.

00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:58.724 align:middle line:84%
You just want to get
electrocuted to get it --

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:00.926 align:middle line:84%
or get in a car accident, but
when you have that feeling,

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.161 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to give it up,

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:04.163 align:middle line:84%
and this is the proving
ground for that.

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:05.698 align:middle line:90%
This side of the fence.

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:08.367 align:middle line:84%
I've had the opportunity to peek
over the fence a couple times

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:13.806 align:middle line:84%
to over there, and whatever
that is for me is different

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.408 align:middle line:90%
than what this is here for me.

00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:16.742 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Sure, and you'll
get there eventually.

00:16:16.742 --> 00:16:17.676 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Well, we're all going.

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:19.078 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You don't
have to run there.

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:20.379 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: By the
way -- exactly, and, you know,

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.715 align:middle line:84%
the thing about it is I
really get that we come

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:90%
in on time, you go out on time.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.718 align:middle line:84%
To be worried about
when you're going

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:28.854 align:middle line:84%
to die negates the whole
opportunity to be alive.

00:16:28.854 --> 00:16:33.492 align:middle line:84%
We spend so much time worrying
about and it's fascinated me,

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:36.495 align:middle line:84%
you know, on the human
level of things, you're --

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:39.799 align:middle line:84%
if you're lucky, you make
77.6 years in this country --

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:42.735 align:middle line:84%
in America, that's 28,000 some
odd days, and you're going

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:43.969 align:middle line:84%
to worry about dying
while you're alive.

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:45.337 align:middle line:90%
I find that fascinating.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So, when we learn the major
and minor things all the time,

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.343 align:middle line:84%
we get minor results, and when
life presents you opportunities

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to do major things -- do
radio shows, get on do TV,

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.482 align:middle line:84%
write books, that's the
brass ring you might want

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:57.683 align:middle line:90%
to grasp onto.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:58.751 align:middle line:84%
Something that you have
in your life you can share

00:16:58.751 --> 00:16:59.752 align:middle line:90%
with somebody else.

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:01.253 align:middle line:84%
It expands their
boundaries immensely.

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:02.721 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're here to do.

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.457 align:middle line:84%
Be more like that
which we came from.

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:07.293 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: John, did these
two experiences --

00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:09.995 align:middle line:84%
did they make your life a
little more conservative,

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:90%
a little more reckless?

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.865 align:middle line:84%
Did you change at
all because of that?

00:17:13.865 --> 00:17:15.968 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I think that --

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.202 align:middle line:90%
that's a really good question.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:18.437 align:middle line:90%
You ask good questions.

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:22.074 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably
why you do what you do.

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:23.209 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Whatever I do.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.343 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
If I were too guess.

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.945 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. You know what, it
made me more serious,

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:28.914 align:middle line:84%
which I don't like, but it made
me more serious about things

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:29.982 align:middle line:84%
that are important,
which I do like.

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Good.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.251 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
And -- but I am --

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:33.486 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'll go and jump
on a zip line, if I can.

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:35.621 align:middle line:84%
I still want to go swim with
a -- have a great white,

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.189 align:middle line:90%
you know, in a cage though.

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:39.592 align:middle line:84%
I want to feel these
things that I felt that day

00:17:39.592 --> 00:17:41.927 align:middle line:90%
that came at such a high price.

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was thinking
about this this morning,

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:84%
when you realize the odds of
being born are astronomical,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.436 align:middle line:84%
then you want to
experience as much.

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:53.372 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just the opportunity
to be born is ridiculous.

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:55.508 align:middle line:84%
It's just an amazing
process, so to get here

00:17:55.508 --> 00:17:56.942 align:middle line:90%
and go oh God, I'm bored.

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:59.745 align:middle line:84%
I find that fascinating, and
if you do that long enough,

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.614 align:middle line:84%
life will come along and
shake you to wake you up.

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:04.683 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's -- it's always
the balance, you know, I'm very,

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:06.685 align:middle line:90%
very serious about these things.

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:09.188 align:middle line:84%
I don't take myself seriously,
but I take these things

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:13.292 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen and felt in other
people's lives very seriously,

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.361 align:middle line:84%
because I think, much like
yourself and much like Jessica,

00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:18.097 align:middle line:84%
and all of us, we're all
messengers in our way,

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:23.102 align:middle line:84%
and when you feel that, that's
what brings you alive, you know.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.137 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, you -- I've
always looked at it too --

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:30.009 align:middle line:84%
all of us, we are the
offspring of our parents

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:32.378 align:middle line:90%
and our father's winner.

00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:35.214 align:middle line:84%
We got -- we got
to the egg first.

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:36.415 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Exactly right.

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:37.249 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't know
what the exact number is,

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:38.584 align:middle line:90%
it's like one in one carillon.

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:39.785 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Yeah, and we
were the winners.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:40.719 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Yeah, so when you're here.

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:41.987 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Everybody
here is a winner.

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:43.088 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:44.056 align:middle line:84%
So. Everybody's trying
to win a lottery --

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:45.524 align:middle line:90%
I'm like you already did.

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:47.092 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take
another question for John.

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:48.127 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.061 align:middle line:90%
Yes, mam.

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:49.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Suzanna: Hi, John.

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:50.963 align:middle line:90%
My name is Suzanna.

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.699 align:middle line:84%
My question for you is,
do you feel that incidents

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:56.202 align:middle line:84%
like these are messages
from a creator?

00:18:56.202 --> 00:18:57.136 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I couldn't hear her.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.504 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Messages from
a creator --

00:18:58.504 --> 00:18:59.805 align:middle line:90%
the things that happened to you.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:03.442 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: You
want to go deep, don't you?

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:07.012 align:middle line:84%
Okay. I think that we are not
the creator, but we are part

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:09.348 align:middle line:84%
of the creator, and so these
things that happened to me,

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:11.817 align:middle line:84%
I believe were more
or less a blueprint.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.786 align:middle line:84%
I believe we all
have a blueprint.

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:16.188 align:middle line:84%
You get to read the script
a little bit more each day.

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
You get to pick and choose what
comes your way, you know, you --

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.593 align:middle line:84%
I'll do this, but I won't'
do this, and so like --

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:22.895 align:middle line:84%
life is like an equal
opportunity employer

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.063 align:middle line:90%
that you can grow from --

00:19:24.063 --> 00:19:26.465 align:middle line:84%
or destroyer, if you
decide to go that route.

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:29.501 align:middle line:84%
So, if they are subliminal
messages or messages

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.871 align:middle line:90%
from the creator -- yes,

00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:34.773 align:middle line:84%
but I had this experience
this morning.

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:36.609 align:middle line:84%
It was about 4 o'clock in
the morning and I'm staying

00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:84%
in a haunted hotel
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.411 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Perfect.

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:40.112 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Yeah, it is perfect.

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:40.946 align:middle line:90%
You -- that's why we...

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:41.513 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: We caught that.

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:42.348 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:43.349 align:middle line:90%
We put you in that [laughter].

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
In that room.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.685 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We have an Alfred
Hitchcock sick sense

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:90%
of humor [laughter].

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.955 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: But,
the thought came to me --

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:53.192 align:middle line:84%
and this is for me, whether you
agree or not, that's up to you,

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.628 align:middle line:84%
that there's no creator outside
of us, it's inside of us,

00:19:55.628 --> 00:19:57.563 align:middle line:84%
and if it's inside of
us, then it's all of us,

00:19:57.563 --> 00:20:00.332 align:middle line:84%
and so whatever comes from me
-- both negative and positive.

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:03.936 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that comes on the
lower vibrational end of myself,

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:05.738 align:middle line:84%
you know, I get upset
at politics, and sports,

00:20:05.738 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and crap -- that's
ego-driven stuff,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.343 align:middle line:84%
but the higher-minded stuff,
the things of being here today,

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.878 align:middle line:84%
when just a couple
weeks ago, you know,

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.714 align:middle line:84%
it just all falls together --
that's the God-type of stuff,

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
the creator-type of stuff
and the more I get connected

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.586 align:middle line:84%
to that, the easier or more
interesting my life gets.

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.054 align:middle line:84%
The less I do, the
more difficult gets.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.956 align:middle line:90%
So, I think there's a blueprint.

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.724 align:middle line:84%
I think the blueprint's
in each of us.

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.626 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a
designer of the blueprint --

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:28.994 align:middle line:90%
or architect of the blueprint,

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:31.797 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a removed
architect, it's built within us.

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:33.065 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.199 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:35.167 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: By the way, we
had cameras in your room

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:36.335 align:middle line:84%
for our new reality
show [laughter],

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:37.569 align:middle line:90%
which we're going to air...

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:38.237 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Scare the crap out of John.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.038 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's right.

00:20:39.038 --> 00:20:39.571 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.372 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:41.073 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Something like that.

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.141 align:middle line:90%
You grew up in Chicago.

00:20:42.141 --> 00:20:43.242 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Detroit.

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:44.576 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Oh, yes, yes.

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.278 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I've got some similar
experiences in the mid-west,

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:47.680 align:middle line:90%
which I truly appreciate.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.048 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:53.085 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: These two experiences
-- did you see the traditional,

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.854 align:middle line:84%
you know, light at
the end of the tunnel?

00:20:55.854 --> 00:20:58.757 align:middle line:84%
Your dead relatives
were there to meet you?

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.092 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
All lined up with harps.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:00.859 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:02.127 align:middle line:90%
Did any of that happen?

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:03.896 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: No,
and I -- I think, for me,

00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:90%
go back to the blueprint.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.565 align:middle line:84%
I think that whatever
it is that's supposed

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:10.402 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate my experiences
-- how I will experience it,

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:13.439 align:middle line:84%
you know, as I said, you know,
much like yourself, you know,

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:16.241 align:middle line:84%
a grind and pound way of
growing up in my life.

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:17.443 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:18.777 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: And
that's what comes to me.

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:22.114 align:middle line:84%
I rarely have angels floating
around, singing me songs.

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.215 align:middle line:90%
I don't get that.

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:24.783 align:middle line:84%
It comes to me in a way
I can understand it.

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:25.617 align:middle line:90%
It's much like music.

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:27.753 align:middle line:90%
It's much like radio.

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:30.089 align:middle line:84%
I connect with certain
vibrational frequencies,

00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:32.257 align:middle line:84%
and I don't listen to other
ones, so why would I --

00:21:32.257 --> 00:21:33.792 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't make
any sense to me,

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:36.328 align:middle line:84%
and so my life experiences
-- the people I'm around,

00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:39.498 align:middle line:84%
the people I connect with,
the experiences I have from,

00:21:39.498 --> 00:21:41.066 align:middle line:84%
you know, having to have
the middle seat on the plane

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:43.736 align:middle line:84%
out here, talking to these two
guys -- that's my experience.

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:45.804 align:middle line:84%
I'm a middle seat
kind of guy, you know,

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:47.406 align:middle line:90%
so they come to me that way.

00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:48.741 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Are you afraid
of dying again?

00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:49.241 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: No.

00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:49.908 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: None, at all.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.744 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I'm afraid of not living.

00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:52.745 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:53.912 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Fully, living.

00:21:53.912 --> 00:21:55.614 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of not getting
enough goose bumps.

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:56.949 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of not -- you know,

00:21:56.949 --> 00:21:59.118 align:middle line:84%
I get up at 4 o'clock most
every morning just to look at...

00:21:59.118 --> 00:22:00.185 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh, wow.

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:90%
But you're not reckless.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.654 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
No, no, no, I mean,

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:03.622 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
I'd want to...

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I'm going to drive

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.159 align:middle line:84%
through an intersection
with my eyes closed.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:07.926 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: No.

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:09.027 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: None of that right?

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:10.095 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
No, no, no, no, no.

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:11.497 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to prove
anything anymore.

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:12.564 align:middle line:84%
I've seen -- I think what I've
been given has been presented

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:14.566 align:middle line:90%
to me in two big wake up calls.

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:17.102 align:middle line:84%
I get little ones, because I do
hit the snooze button, you know,

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:19.471 align:middle line:84%
whether it's donating
an organ to my daughter,

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.974 align:middle line:84%
or walking a 1,000
mile round trip in --

00:22:21.974 --> 00:22:23.809 align:middle line:84%
in a way that I never
thought I would.

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:25.911 align:middle line:90%
I'm not reckless.

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:27.246 align:middle line:90%
I'm cautiously optimistic.

00:22:27.246 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What did you donate?

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.581 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: A kidney.

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:30.682 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You did?

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:31.383 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Yeah, 11 years ago.

00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:32.518 align:middle line:90%
And that my friend...

00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:34.086 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Tell me about the
-- what happened there?

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.454 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
See, that's major woo-woo.

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:38.557 align:middle line:84%
That really pushed John out of
any comfort zone I had left.

00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
My daughter, Amanda Lee,
was born with kidney reflux,

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.961 align:middle line:84%
which is very common --
did not grow out of it.

00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:44.263 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What is that?

00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:45.597 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: It's
when the ureter that goes

00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:47.099 align:middle line:84%
into the kidney which you
would urinate, it wouldn't --

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:49.635 align:middle line:84%
it would go out of the
kidney and sit back in her...

00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:50.636 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: In her inner bladder?

00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:51.403 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Inner bladder.

00:22:51.403 --> 00:22:52.404 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's your backup.

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:52.838 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
In the backup.

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:53.372 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Okay.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.774 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: So,
the kidneys got diseased,

00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:56.742 align:middle line:84%
and so when she -- it
didn't reverse itself.

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
We thought it would
-- it never did.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.612 align:middle line:84%
So when she was five years old,
Chicago Children's Hospital,

00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:03.549 align:middle line:84%
they said we're going
to go reset that,

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:05.317 align:middle line:84%
and the day before they
were supposed to do it,

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:07.786 align:middle line:84%
which is tough enough anyway
-- we're young parents,

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.855 align:middle line:90%
I got a call and the guy said,

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:11.223 align:middle line:84%
well I've got good
news and bad news.

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:15.227 align:middle line:84%
The good news is I'm the
new doctor on the surgery,

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.496 align:middle line:84%
the bad news is we have to
take her right kidney out.

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:19.097 align:middle line:84%
And when you've got
a five-year-old,

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:20.599 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever had
sick kids, you know,

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:90%
that's really difficult.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.335 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It's like
getting stabbed yourself.

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:24.403 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
But the guy

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:27.439 align:middle line:84%
that called was named
Dr. Kevin Gandhi.

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Well, I like that.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I liked that, too.

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:30.909 align:middle line:90%
I thought, well.

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.578 align:middle line:84%
And I was expecting to show
up and see a little bald guy

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:34.246 align:middle line:84%
with a, you know, thing on --
it wasn't like that at all.

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.547 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We're going to
take out the kidney.

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:36.648 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:38.684 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out whether
you like it or not.

00:23:38.684 --> 00:23:41.286 align:middle line:84%
And -- and he did this
amazing surgery and he came

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:43.722 align:middle line:84%
up afterwards, and he says I
think eventually she'll be okay.

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:46.792 align:middle line:84%
She had a quarter of her
left kidney working still,

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.927 align:middle line:84%
and I go in to see her
after the surgery --

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:49.895 align:middle line:90%
tubes, the whole thing.

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:50.762 align:middle line:90%
She's all drugged up.

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:51.396 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Okay.

00:23:51.396 --> 00:23:52.464 align:middle line:90%
One kidney's gone.

00:23:52.464 --> 00:23:53.265 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
One kidney's gone.

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.199 align:middle line:90%
A quarter of a kidney left.

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:55.567 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: A quarter
of a kidney left.

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:57.369 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: On the
left side, and the next day,

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:59.004 align:middle line:84%
the medical team came
in and pronounced

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.906 align:middle line:84%
that here's what was
going to happen in a year.

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:03.408 align:middle line:84%
She'd need a dialysis every
day and eventually be put

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:04.743 align:middle line:84%
on a waiting list, and
all these kinds of things,

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:07.579 align:middle line:84%
because that's how they
-- that's how it happens.

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:08.547 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's life.

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:09.181 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
That's life.

00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:10.315 align:middle line:90%
That's how it is.

00:24:10.315 --> 00:24:12.451 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've already been
fried and hit by a car,

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:15.821 align:middle line:84%
so maybe go somewhere else with
this, and I started talking,

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.356 align:middle line:84%
right, and said Amanda,
we can do what they say,

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:18.891 align:middle line:84%
which is their protocol
and I give it to them.

00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:20.225 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:21.593 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: But,
maybe there's another route,

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:24.296 align:middle line:84%
and I'm -- had been interested
ever since the car accident,

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:25.898 align:middle line:90%
about the mind body connection.

00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd been on Xanax, at the
time, back then, way too long

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.669 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I got to
mentally get out of this.

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:31.803 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:32.905 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
how you got off that.

00:24:32.905 --> 00:24:34.473 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
So, I said to her --

00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:35.908 align:middle line:84%
because I had the
experience, I said,

00:24:35.908 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:90%
what are we going to be today?

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.244 align:middle line:90%
What can you be today?

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:40.712 align:middle line:84%
And she was five years
old with tubes in her,

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:43.982 align:middle line:84%
and she said positive in
my kidneys getting better.

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:45.317 align:middle line:84%
And I started asking
that question,

00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:48.053 align:middle line:90%
George for eight years.

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:48.854 align:middle line:90%
Every day.

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:49.855 align:middle line:90%
Couple hundred times a day.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:50.923 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was
always different.

00:24:50.923 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:90%
She was pretty bored.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:52.958 align:middle line:90%
Okay, dad I'm better.

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.593 align:middle line:90%
My kidney's fine, you know.

00:24:54.593 --> 00:24:57.329 align:middle line:84%
But, after about three years
of this, we went back in --

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:58.997 align:middle line:84%
we'd always get checkups
every six to eight weeks,

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:01.199 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was, and
the doctor said --

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:03.135 align:middle line:84%
they called all these surgeons
in and go, look at this,

00:25:03.135 --> 00:25:05.671 align:middle line:84%
and she was having what's
called compensatory growth

00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:07.339 align:middle line:84%
on her kidney, which
is unheard of.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.908 align:middle line:84%
Livers regenerate, but
kidneys aren't supposed to.

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:11.043 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Kidneys don't,
but this was.

00:25:11.043 --> 00:25:12.477 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
A little bulb popped up,

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:14.112 align:middle line:84%
and I thought well,
isn't that interesting.

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:15.447 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
took all the credit --

00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:17.182 align:middle line:84%
well, it's all the
-- that's fine.

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:19.785 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know I was asking
her this question every day.

00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:23.388 align:middle line:84%
So, we went on until she was 13,
and the kidney was wearing out.

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:25.724 align:middle line:84%
Her body was changing,
she was becoming a woman.

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:27.359 align:middle line:84%
My father and grandfather
both dies

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.660 align:middle line:90%
of polycystic kidney disease.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.528 align:middle line:90%
It's a heredity...

00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:30.429 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's genetic.

00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:31.196 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:32.831 align:middle line:90%
My sister didn't have it.

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:33.665 align:middle line:90%
There's only two of us.

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:34.666 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:35.667 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Here's Johnny,

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.102 align:middle line:84%
and I really resisted
getting tested.

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:37.936 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to feed it.

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:38.904 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to get into that.

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:40.238 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to give
it any energy,

00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:42.808 align:middle line:84%
so I go through all these
battery of tests, and they say,

00:25:42.808 --> 00:25:43.842 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you're the
perfect candidate.

00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:45.344 align:middle line:84%
I was 43, I was in
really great shape,

00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:47.045 align:middle line:90%
but we have to do an ultrasound

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:50.048 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether those
cysts are on your kidneys.

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:52.084 align:middle line:84%
If I got it, I can't
give her a kidney,

00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:53.819 align:middle line:84%
then we got some
serious problems.

00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:84%
We already got serious problems,
we don't need more than that,

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.122 align:middle line:84%
so I went for six
weeks, you know,

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:59.024 align:middle line:84%
the whole forgetting
everything I've learned

00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:00.425 align:middle line:90%
in my wake up calls.

00:26:00.425 --> 00:26:03.495 align:middle line:84%
Going why is this happening and
what am I going to do about it?

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:06.098 align:middle line:84%
The same place where I
live in Michigan now,

00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:07.866 align:middle line:84%
Native American friends of
mine have this big lodge

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:13.238 align:middle line:84%
on their property and I went in
on a Saturday morning, May 2002,

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:16.208 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing
a ceremony there,

00:26:16.208 --> 00:26:17.609 align:middle line:84%
which I just happened
to walk in on.

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:21.513 align:middle line:84%
And I sat in a north direction
chair, and the gentleman,

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:23.315 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Hardwick, who
owns the property

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:25.884 align:middle line:84%
and does all this stuff, he
was doing this naming ceremony

00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:28.654 align:middle line:84%
and there was another
guy sitting in the west

00:26:28.654 --> 00:26:30.022 align:middle line:84%
and then there was a
woman sitting in the east,

00:26:30.022 --> 00:26:31.256 align:middle line:84%
and I sat in a chair
much like this,

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.624 align:middle line:84%
and I thought well it's
a beautiful Saturday,

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:34.826 align:middle line:84%
I took my shoes off and I was
rubbing my feet in the sand

00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:37.429 align:middle line:84%
and kind of listening
to what's going on.

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:38.964 align:middle line:84%
And I have out-of-body
experience,

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:41.199 align:middle line:84%
but not death experience,
number three.

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:42.567 align:middle line:84%
All of sudden, I'm
-- and you got

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:43.935 align:middle line:90%
to remember, I'm from Chicago.

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:46.772 align:middle line:84%
We just don't do this, so
this is still really pushing

00:26:46.772 --> 00:26:47.606 align:middle line:90%
my buttons.

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:49.174 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, I'm watching me

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:52.077 align:middle line:84%
in the chair while
all this is going on,

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:53.812 align:middle line:84%
and I feel this enormous
presence coming

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:56.348 align:middle line:84%
from outside this lodge, which
is, you know, 40 feet high

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:58.216 align:middle line:84%
in the middle, big
poles, fire going,

00:26:58.216 --> 00:27:00.318 align:middle line:84%
very much what you'd
see in a movie.

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:01.753 align:middle line:84%
And he's still talking
and everything --

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:03.121 align:middle line:84%
the flies are still
flying around

00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:06.958 align:middle line:84%
and this enormous force is
coming, and all of a sudden,

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:84%
through -- and I'm not
kidding, this really happened.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Through the wall of the
lodge a man walks through

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.198 align:middle line:90%
and it's like he's on rounds.

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:16.668 align:middle line:84%
He's got a red beard,
red hair, and blue eyes,

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:19.471 align:middle line:84%
and a tunic with a robe,
and he's just on rounds.

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:22.007 align:middle line:84%
He comes walking past the guy
talking and he comes right

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:24.743 align:middle line:84%
through the fire, and he walks
up to my body in the chair,

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:27.379 align:middle line:84%
and he puts his arms
around my lower body --

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:31.483 align:middle line:84%
right here, about here,
and he takes his hands out

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:35.721 align:middle line:84%
and they're covered with tar,
and he says to me in the chair.

00:27:35.721 --> 00:27:39.124 align:middle line:84%
John, you don't need this
anymore, and next thing I know,

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:41.793 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the chair and
all this happened.

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:43.061 align:middle line:90%
And the guy's still talking

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:44.229 align:middle line:84%
and the flies are still
flying around, my [inaudible]

00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:47.065 align:middle line:90%
like what the hell is this.

00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:50.836 align:middle line:84%
Then I went huh, and as soon as
I said that, the first thought

00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:54.406 align:middle line:84%
that came into my mind said,
oh that was the Jesus man.

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:56.441 align:middle line:90%
I don't even go to church.

00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:59.578 align:middle line:84%
This was so far beyond
my comprehension.

00:27:59.578 --> 00:28:01.146 align:middle line:84%
I left. I went down
and told my wife,

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:03.582 align:middle line:84%
I said you're not
going to believe this.

00:28:03.582 --> 00:28:04.349 align:middle line:90%
I told her what happened.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:06.218 align:middle line:90%
We told nobody else.

00:28:06.218 --> 00:28:08.687 align:middle line:84%
Three days later we go
to get the ultrasound.

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:10.455 align:middle line:84%
They do the wand thing and
I'm goofing around like,

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:13.258 align:middle line:84%
am I pregnant, you know, we're
having a -- because I'm nervous.

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:16.128 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's going on in
here, and the woman just happen

00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:18.029 align:middle line:84%
to be someone we
knew -- was the tech,

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:20.165 align:middle line:84%
and she said you're supposed
to wait for the official word

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:24.336 align:middle line:84%
from the doctor, but there's
scarring on your kidneys.

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:27.305 align:middle line:84%
Whatever was there
is gone, and I...

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:28.573 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: A miracle.

00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:29.775 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: And
I, you know, to this day,

00:28:29.775 --> 00:28:31.309 align:middle line:84%
11 years later, my
daughter's kidney is perfect --

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:32.310 align:middle line:90%
the one I gave her.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.745 align:middle line:90%
She's never had a problem.

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:37.582 align:middle line:84%
It's powered by things
bigger than me and, you know,

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:40.752 align:middle line:84%
that's probably, of all
the experiences I've had

00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
in my little blueprint here --
my little path, most humbling.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.925 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about it
in my second book.

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:49.628 align:middle line:84%
I got a flood of mail saying I
should go to church more often,

00:28:49.628 --> 00:28:50.662 align:middle line:84%
you know, stuff like
that, but that, to me,

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:90%
that's not what that was about.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.964 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's amazing.

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:54.266 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
And I was very clear.

00:28:54.266 --> 00:28:56.568 align:middle line:84%
I was one stop of many for
whatever this was all about.

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:59.237 align:middle line:84%
It was just a brief thing
and on to the next one.

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:00.906 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I bet you
didn't even think twice

00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:02.440 align:middle line:90%
about donating that kidney.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.608 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Oh, no,

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.409 align:middle line:84%
and if I could grow
them, I'd give them away.

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.477 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Good for you.

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:06.478 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
There's a huge...

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:07.612 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How many people
would do that?

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:08.413 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Oh, I don't, there --

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:09.781 align:middle line:90%
they have angel donors now.

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:11.183 align:middle line:90%
People that step forward.

00:29:11.183 --> 00:29:13.552 align:middle line:84%
But here's what I learned too
about those first two incidents,

00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:15.654 align:middle line:84%
you know, we think this is
ours -- it's a meat suit.

00:29:15.654 --> 00:29:16.922 align:middle line:90%
This is -- this is our machine.

00:29:16.922 --> 00:29:17.989 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yep.

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:19.291 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
It's like our car.

00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:20.792 align:middle line:84%
We take better care of our
cars than we do our bodies.

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.927 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's true.

00:29:21.927 --> 00:29:23.061 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
You know, unfortunately.

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:24.396 align:middle line:84%
And we have spare parts
for cars all the time

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:25.897 align:middle line:90%
to make them run better.

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:30.769 align:middle line:84%
It is, for me, the height
of being egotistical to say,

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:33.805 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking all this with me and
putting it in a box and going

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:36.007 align:middle line:84%
to store it somewhere,
never to be used again

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:42.013 align:middle line:84%
in this time around, and if
someone of the we can use that,

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's
like, God-stuff.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.352 align:middle line:90%
We didn't create this suite.

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:48.587 align:middle line:84%
We didn't put all
this stuff in here.

00:29:48.587 --> 00:29:50.755 align:middle line:90%
How dare we say it's mine.

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: These two experiences
-- the donating of the kidney,

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.461 align:middle line:90%
what did it do to your life?

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:57.529 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Well,

00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:58.563 align:middle line:84%
it's just an [background
talking] expansion

00:29:58.563 --> 00:29:59.264 align:middle line:84%
on everything else
I've done, you know,

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:00.265 align:middle line:90%
now I have opportunity.

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:01.766 align:middle line:84%
I did your show a
few months ago.

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.101 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.135 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: I get
to speak all over the world.

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I still get
responses from that.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: I do too.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.504 align:middle line:90%
It's usually hate mail.

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:07.472 align:middle line:90%
No, no, [laughter] I'm kidding.

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That was from me.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.674 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Yeah [laughter].

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:12.544 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
aliases, I see.

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.012 align:middle line:84%
But I get to speak
all over the world --

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:15.881 align:middle line:84%
all over the country and do
these things, and, you know,

00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:19.751 align:middle line:84%
and it's -- it's -- I have
to almost do it sublimely,

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:22.053 align:middle line:84%
because I go out and speak
in corporations and things,

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and yet people are starving to
death to remember who they are,

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.393 align:middle line:84%
and it's so easy to forget,
you know, when you get caught

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:30.695 align:middle line:84%
up in the reality shows and
what's going on in politics

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:32.564 align:middle line:84%
and sports and things,
and, you know,

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I say to people all the time,
and if you take nothing away

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.037 align:middle line:84%
from this today -- can I do like
an audience participation thing?

00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:39.838 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Soon.

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:40.372 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Soon?

00:30:40.372 --> 00:30:41.172 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:42.173 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Okay.

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:42.974 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Oh, do you
want to do it now?

00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:43.541 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Sure.

00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:44.209 align:middle line:90%
Can I do it now?

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:45.043 align:middle line:90%
Spur of the moment.

00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:46.144 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What do you want to do?

00:30:46.144 --> 00:30:46.978 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
If you've ever been

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:47.545 align:middle line:90%
to a cemetery, raise your hand.

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:48.647 align:middle line:90%
Put them down.

00:30:48.647 --> 00:30:49.481 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever seen
Democrat or Republican

00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:50.615 align:middle line:90%
on a headstone, raise your hand.

00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:53.218 align:middle line:90%
I'm 100 for 100.

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:55.287 align:middle line:84%
If it ain't important then,
it ain't important now.

00:30:55.287 --> 00:30:57.389 align:middle line:84%
We get caught up in things
that are none of our business.

00:30:57.389 --> 00:31:00.292 align:middle line:84%
Our lives, the things he
talks about in his show.

00:31:00.292 --> 00:31:01.593 align:middle line:90%
That's our business.

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:03.995 align:middle line:84%
Our business is to be alive
and be living and part

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:06.231 align:middle line:90%
of the we and not just me.

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:07.866 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Every day you
do this now don't you?

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: It's
really annoying [laughter],

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.902 align:middle line:90%
because I can't let it go.

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:12.904 align:middle line:84%
If I let it go, I
get a wakeup call.

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:14.272 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm on the
plane between these two --

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:16.841 align:middle line:84%
I was telling the guys
backstage, it was really funny,

00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:19.477 align:middle line:84%
I got on a plane, and I'm like
a self-appointed air marshal,

00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:84%
of course, you know, because
I'm going to take care of stuff,

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.714 align:middle line:84%
you know, so I always
sit on the aisle.

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:23.682 align:middle line:90%
There was no aisle seat.

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:24.516 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You're ready,
just in case.

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:25.917 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Oh, yeah.

00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:28.286 align:middle line:84%
I sit in the front -- five rows
-- within the first five rows,

00:31:28.286 --> 00:31:29.054 align:middle line:90%
so if somebody runs...

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:30.188 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You're the blocker.

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:31.323 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Well, sure, you know.

00:31:31.323 --> 00:31:32.457 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What if he had
to go to the bathroom?

00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:33.625 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I'm taking him out --

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:34.526 align:middle line:90%
taking him out, anyway.

00:31:34.526 --> 00:31:35.727 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Poor guy.

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.662 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
He's done, you know, so --

00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:39.597 align:middle line:84%
but I sat between these
two guys who were the --

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:41.466 align:middle line:84%
they were salesmen and they
had the thin watches on

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:43.802 align:middle line:84%
and the perfect hair, and they
looked great and they're all --

00:31:43.802 --> 00:31:46.771 align:middle line:84%
they're 180 pounds and I've got
to squeeze my 235 between them,

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:49.107 align:middle line:84%
and I'm laying there and
I'm thinking, okay, I can --

00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:50.475 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's only a two
hour flight to Chicago,

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and all of sudden the little
kid behind me starts singing --

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.646 align:middle line:84%
because I'm kind of steaming
a little bit and sweating,

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.715 align:middle line:84%
being all human, you know,
-- dragging my knuckles --

00:31:56.715 --> 00:31:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't have to sit in
the middle seat, these guys --

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.519 align:middle line:84%
and the girl behind me starts
singing, if you're happy

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.988 align:middle line:84%
and you know it clap
your hands [laughter].

00:32:02.988 --> 00:32:07.192 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What happened
to you in 1996?

00:32:07.192 --> 00:32:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: 1996.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.762 align:middle line:90%
Oh boy, it was a major upheaval.

00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I was working as a teacher and
working in sports marketing.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.536 align:middle line:84%
Life was kind of going
okay, and I had ended

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:21.139 align:middle line:84%
up giving a commencement
address in upper Michigan --

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:23.475 align:middle line:84%
where I still live half
the time, and came back

00:32:23.475 --> 00:32:25.276 align:middle line:90%
from that commencement address

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:26.811 align:middle line:84%
with these Native American
people I had just met,

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:29.848 align:middle line:84%
at the time, and my
life started changing.

00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:32.117 align:middle line:84%
I thought something -- I'm
missing something here.

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:34.886 align:middle line:84%
The corporate stuff ain't
working, and I was in the middle

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:37.355 align:middle line:84%
of the business deal --
even if they catch you

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:38.556 align:middle line:84%
and you got a lot a
lawyers, you're still

00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:40.425 align:middle line:90%
on vacation half the year.

00:32:40.425 --> 00:32:41.559 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:42.861 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
And it was unraveling,

00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:44.262 align:middle line:84%
and my life was unraveling,
and no matter where I went

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:46.698 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago, no matter what
I tried to do, doors closed.

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:49.801 align:middle line:84%
So, the same people whose kid
was in the commencement address

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.803 align:middle line:84%
that I spoke at -- why
don't you come live up here?

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.572 align:middle line:84%
They have a 10-room
motel on US Highway 2

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:56.641 align:middle line:84%
in the Raft River,
nowhere, Michigan.

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:58.143 align:middle line:84%
I thought what in the
world would I do up there?

00:32:58.143 --> 00:32:59.244 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:32:59.244 --> 00:33:00.078 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
And the guy's like,

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:00.612 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing down there?

00:33:00.612 --> 00:33:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.781 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: Long and
short of it, packed everything

00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:03.915 align:middle line:90%
up in a horse trailer.

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:04.749 align:middle line:90%
Put everything in storage.

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:06.351 align:middle line:90%
Put my kids in kindergarten.

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:09.954 align:middle line:84%
I sat in this room for two
weeks, and that six months prior

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:84%
to that, I started having
these snapshot morning visions.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.196 align:middle line:84%
I'd see myself in the -- with a
backpack on, on the setting sun

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:21.566 align:middle line:84%
on my left, walking on the side
of the road with a big beard.

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:22.467 align:middle line:90%
Every other morning.

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:23.635 align:middle line:90%
Drove me nuts.

00:33:23.635 --> 00:33:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know what it
meant, and I got up there,

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.105 align:middle line:90%
the kids are in school.

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm in there for two weeks,
I have the same vision.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I go see the gentlemen who's
-- I mentioned earlier,

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.445 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Hardwick, who
owns this lodge.

00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:36.047 align:middle line:84%
He's a Ojibwa Firekeeper,
elder for the area.

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:38.416 align:middle line:84%
I give him some tobacco, which
is very important to them,

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and he takes me out back in
the forest and he's as tall

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.557 align:middle line:84%
as he is wide, with white hair,
you know, and he holds my hand

00:33:45.557 --> 00:33:47.125 align:middle line:84%
and he says, you're
being given a chance

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:48.259 align:middle line:90%
to start your life over.

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:50.328 align:middle line:84%
Again? You're being
given a vision --

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:52.864 align:middle line:84%
like it happens all the
time, which it doesn't.

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said you can go
back the way you came

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.435 align:middle line:84%
or you can see what
the great mystery has.

00:33:57.435 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:90%
I took door number two.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.106 align:middle line:84%
I was out of work, didn't
have anything going on.

00:34:01.106 --> 00:34:02.574 align:middle line:90%
Everything going in storage.

00:34:02.574 --> 00:34:04.676 align:middle line:84%
Three cars sitting in a parking
lot at a motel in room nine

00:34:04.676 --> 00:34:07.078 align:middle line:84%
and 10, and didn't
know what to do.

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:08.113 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Were you on Xanax then?

00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: No.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.313 align:middle line:90%
I should have been.

00:34:09.313 --> 00:34:10.315 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:11.081 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
But I wasn't.

00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:14.119 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I had to walk.

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:17.021 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen it, and so I said
to him, I have to walk,

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:84%
and I think I have
to walk to Chicago,

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.090 align:middle line:90%
which I just left two weeks ago.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:90%
He said, okay.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.494 align:middle line:84%
We go that night
to a big ceremony.

00:34:22.494 --> 00:34:23.795 align:middle line:90%
They got a fire going.

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:25.764 align:middle line:84%
There's a bunch of people
there I kind of hardly know,

00:34:25.764 --> 00:34:27.499 align:middle line:90%
and I said I'm going to walk

00:34:27.499 --> 00:34:31.202 align:middle line:84%
from where I just drove 350
miles north, and a guy stands

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:32.470 align:middle line:90%
up on the other side --

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.838 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Dwayne Kanart
[assumed spelling] stands

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.005 align:middle line:84%
up on the other side of the
fire and goes I'll go with you.

00:34:35.005 --> 00:34:36.541 align:middle line:84%
I thought you're
out of your mind.

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:39.177 align:middle line:84%
He's got a job, you know
-- crazier than I am.

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:40.677 align:middle line:84%
Couple days later,
another guy heard about it.

00:34:40.677 --> 00:34:41.346 align:middle line:90%
He goes with us.

00:34:41.346 --> 00:34:42.680 align:middle line:90%
There's three of us.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.616 align:middle line:84%
Could have never seen that
when I just got that snapshot.

00:34:44.616 --> 00:34:47.485 align:middle line:84%
Long and short of it
is, September, October,

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:50.755 align:middle line:84%
November we left upper
Michigan, about 100 miles south

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:53.724 align:middle line:84%
of the Canadian border and
walked to Chicago on foot.

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:54.826 align:middle line:90%
It's not a straight shot.

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:56.828 align:middle line:84%
It's illegal to walk
on the freeway,

00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:57.929 align:middle line:90%
so it started zigzagging,

00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:00.064 align:middle line:84%
so a 350 miles turns
into about 700 miles.

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:01.299 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:02.734 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
And, amazing experiences...

00:35:02.734 --> 00:35:04.302 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sounds like Forrest Gump.

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.937 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Before the movie, I did it.

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.071 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:08.206 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
It was really something.

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And the beard came and
the whole nine yards.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.441 align:middle line:90%
It's a great weight loss thing.

00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:12.577 align:middle line:84%
I ate nuts, and berries,
and things.

00:35:12.577 --> 00:35:13.778 align:middle line:84%
And on the way down
it was quite a thing.

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It was in the news and we
got motels given to us,

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.815 align:middle line:84%
and quite pampered
on the way down.

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:84%
We get all the way to
Chicago, and they leave.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.354 align:middle line:90%
He's got to go back to work.

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:25.056 align:middle line:84%
The other guy -- Joe Johnson
leaves, and there I am

00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:27.492 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago going what do
I do now, and the voice --

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:29.761 align:middle line:90%
you got to walk back alone.

00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:31.963 align:middle line:84%
So that was really the walk
for me, was the undoing

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.765 align:middle line:84%
of what had been
done in my life.

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:36.501 align:middle line:84%
Really pulling up the leaf
systems and deep roots

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:37.835 align:middle line:84%
that we all have
that we're not --

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:40.238 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's like
you can cut the grass,

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:42.207 align:middle line:84%
but the weeds always come back
until you pull the roots out,

00:35:42.207 --> 00:35:44.142 align:middle line:84%
so my life's about
pulling out roots,

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:46.377 align:middle line:90%
and -- or as they say roots.

00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:50.748 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that walk back
and it was very difficult.

00:35:50.748 --> 00:35:53.051 align:middle line:84%
Nobody -- no motels,
nobody following me.

00:35:53.051 --> 00:35:55.053 align:middle line:84%
About every three days,
somebody would check on me.

00:35:55.053 --> 00:35:57.589 align:middle line:84%
And one day outside of
Oconomowoc, Wisconsin,

00:35:57.589 --> 00:36:01.226 align:middle line:84%
George I stopped
dead in my tracks.

00:36:01.226 --> 00:36:04.062 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing the same
scene that I had seen

00:36:04.062 --> 00:36:05.930 align:middle line:90%
in my brain for months.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.198 align:middle line:90%
How's that possible?

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:08.399 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:09.767 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: My
wirings all going crazy,

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:12.237 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I stood there
and I had a stick in my hand,

00:36:12.237 --> 00:36:13.705 align:middle line:84%
and a bear here, and
the sun was on my left,

00:36:13.705 --> 00:36:15.006 align:middle line:90%
and I saw the exact same road.

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.407 align:middle line:90%
How could that be?

00:36:16.407 --> 00:36:18.276 align:middle line:84%
How could you see
before it happens?

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:21.312 align:middle line:84%
I don't have an answer for
that, but I'm just glad it did.

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:22.747 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I was
standing there, this --

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:23.982 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to move.

00:36:23.982 --> 00:36:25.717 align:middle line:84%
I thought this is the
coolest thing in the world,

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:27.218 align:middle line:84%
and the wind came
off the lake and kind

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:29.487 align:middle line:84%
of moved me a little bit, and
this voice said in my head --

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:33.458 align:middle line:84%
clear as a bell,
John, go on the radio.

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:35.593 align:middle line:90%
Sure, I'm living in a motel.

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:36.728 align:middle line:90%
I have no experience.

00:36:36.728 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll go on the radio,
you know, what the hell.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.599 align:middle line:84%
So, I started walking and about
an hour later a woman checked

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:44.535 align:middle line:84%
on me for the day,
and I got in her car,

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:46.237 align:middle line:84%
and a gentleman we both
know -- Barry Farber.

00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:47.205 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Uh-huh.

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:48.039 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
On the radio

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.073 align:middle line:90%
in her little battered Toyota.

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:50.508 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going
to do what he does.

00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:52.944 align:middle line:84%
She's like, you just need a hot
shower and a shot of bourbon,

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:55.413 align:middle line:84%
you'll be all right, because she
knew I knew nothing about radio.

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:56.114 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:36:56.114 --> 00:36:57.348 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine:

00:36:57.348 --> 00:36:59.617 align:middle line:84%
I finished that walk two
days before Thanksgiving --

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:01.986 align:middle line:84%
it took three months,
and the last,

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:03.187 align:middle line:84%
probably the most
profound thing --

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:04.889 align:middle line:84%
there was a couple that
was really important.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:07.959 align:middle line:84%
One is that my friend, Bruce
followed me that last week

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:11.029 align:middle line:84%
with his car, and we were
driving up M-35, which is a road

00:37:11.029 --> 00:37:14.132 align:middle line:84%
that connects Wisconsin and
Michigan and it's very much next

00:37:14.132 --> 00:37:15.833 align:middle line:84%
to the lake and it gets
dark early, it was raining

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:19.203 align:middle line:84%
and snowing, and he was
behind me and he kept

00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:22.307 align:middle line:84%
about a 50 foot distance And
his headlights would illuminate

00:37:22.307 --> 00:37:24.575 align:middle line:84%
where I walked, and I
was walking and walking.

00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:28.179 align:middle line:84%
If I'd stop, he'd stop and
if I'd walk, he'd drive,

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:29.647 align:middle line:90%
and I had this weird epiphany.

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:32.684 align:middle line:84%
I thought, the light
-- the light...

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:33.885 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: The light.

00:37:33.885 --> 00:37:35.653 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
The light comes from us --

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:37.822 align:middle line:84%
that comes through us,
if we stop, it stops.

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:39.424 align:middle line:90%
If we retreat, it retreats.

00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:42.560 align:middle line:84%
How dare I not move
forward with what I'm given.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.195 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
that happened is the day

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:45.997 align:middle line:90%
that the walk ended, I --

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:48.499 align:middle line:84%
he had gone ahead of me to get
some coffee and I wandered off

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:50.735 align:middle line:84%
into the woods of Upper
Michigan and I collapsed.

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:53.971 align:middle line:84%
I was done, covered with
snow, laying there I woke up.

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:55.106 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how long later.

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.141 align:middle line:84%
He was driving back and
forth trying to find me,

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:59.744 align:middle line:84%
and I wandered back
out to the road.

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:02.447 align:middle line:84%
He said we have to go see where
you fell, so we go walking back

00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:04.816 align:middle line:84%
to where I had landed
in the woods

00:38:04.816 --> 00:38:06.818 align:middle line:84%
and there's a perfect
outline, like a chalk...

00:38:06.818 --> 00:38:07.819 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Like an angel.

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:09.053 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
...of my body,

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:10.722 align:middle line:84%
but it had snowed overnight,
so there was like three

00:38:10.722 --> 00:38:12.223 align:middle line:84%
or four inches of
snow on the ground,

00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:15.727 align:middle line:84%
and it was still early enough
that the ground wasn't frozen,

00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:17.929 align:middle line:84%
and here's this perfect
outline of John's body,

00:38:17.929 --> 00:38:21.432 align:middle line:84%
and the only green part showing
through -- where my heart was.

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:22.467 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Was your heart.

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:23.301 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
And to him,

00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:24.135 align:middle line:90%
that was the end of the journey.

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:26.604 align:middle line:90%
That was a big deal, so.

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:27.538 align:middle line:90%
That's -- that's what happened.

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:29.207 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You've gone
through a lot.

00:38:29.207 --> 00:38:30.842 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I hope that's enough.

00:38:30.842 --> 00:38:32.844 align:middle line:84%
Some of it kind of wears
me out a little bit.

00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:34.145 align:middle line:90%
It's like, really, again?

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.713 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I think
I signed up for this.

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:37.014 align:middle line:90%
This is my way.

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:40.985 align:middle line:84%
And I try to remind people
that you don't have to go --

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I think there -- you know,

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.488 align:middle line:84%
it's like running
interference in football.

00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:45.089 align:middle line:84%
Some people just got to take
the hits and the other ones get

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:90%
to go walk across the goal line.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:46.891 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yep.

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:48.259 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: If there's a message
you wanted to convey to people

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.798 align:middle line:84%
about what you went through,
for them what would that be?

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:55.066 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: You know,
it's not what happens to you,

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:57.135 align:middle line:84%
it's how you respond to it
that is a big part of it.

00:38:57.135 --> 00:38:59.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this stuff is very
cliche, but it becomes real

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.705 align:middle line:90%
when you experience it.

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:03.474 align:middle line:84%
I think that, you know,
truly, truly, truly,

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:06.144 align:middle line:84%
in all the people sitting in the
audience, people watching this

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:09.080 align:middle line:84%
on -- at home, you and I
this -- we're all connected.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.416 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to like
it, but inevitability...

00:39:11.416 --> 00:39:12.784 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It is what it is.

00:39:12.784 --> 00:39:13.751 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: ...we're
going to be shoved together.

00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:14.952 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd always
say, you know,

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:16.087 align:middle line:84%
when you squeeze an orange
you get orange juice,

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.221 align:middle line:84%
you squeeze tomatoes,
you get tomato juice,

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:19.457 align:middle line:84%
you squeeze people, all
kind of crap comes out.

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:21.626 align:middle line:84%
And our job, once we
get squeezed in life,

00:39:21.626 --> 00:39:22.994 align:middle line:90%
is to clean that crap up.

00:39:22.994 --> 00:39:25.096 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're here to do,
and we can help each other.

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:26.431 align:middle line:84%
You know, I listen
to you all the time

00:39:26.431 --> 00:39:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and these conversations you're
having with people are --

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.268 align:middle line:90%
are here to get things clearer.

00:39:30.268 --> 00:39:33.471 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Lout Sioux says,
can you stand in the river

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:36.274 align:middle line:84%
of life while the
silt gets kicked up?

00:39:36.274 --> 00:39:37.408 align:middle line:84%
Can you stand in
the river of life

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:39.444 align:middle line:84%
until the silt settles,
you can see clearly.

00:39:39.444 --> 00:39:42.280 align:middle line:84%
What you realize is, we're
the ones kicking the silt up,

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.949 align:middle line:84%
and then we go look,
what's happening?

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:46.083 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it.

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:48.953 align:middle line:84%
There's no -- it's us,
you know, it's on us.

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:50.221 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: So true.

00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:52.824 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some more questions
for John St. Augustine.

00:39:52.824 --> 00:39:54.859 align:middle line:90%
Yes, mam. Way in the back.

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:55.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, John.

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.761 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Morning.

00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:57.995 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm curious the
electrical current --

00:39:57.995 --> 00:40:01.098 align:middle line:84%
do you think that that
could possibly be the reason

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:04.035 align:middle line:84%
for your heightened
sense of awareness?

00:40:04.035 --> 00:40:04.969 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
I absolutely do.

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:06.204 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely do.

00:40:06.204 --> 00:40:08.506 align:middle line:84%
I've -- ever since then
I've never really shied away

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:09.807 align:middle line:90%
from electrical things.

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:11.809 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time about 10
years after that happened,

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.544 align:middle line:84%
I went to a wedding
and they had one

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:16.814 align:middle line:84%
of those champagne
fountains, and for some reason,

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.082 align:middle line:90%
I was reaching to touch that --

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:19.584 align:middle line:84%
I think it was made
out of copper,

00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:21.686 align:middle line:84%
and I was touching something
that was wet and I got it again.

00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:22.854 align:middle line:90%
It was only 120 volts.

00:40:22.854 --> 00:40:24.655 align:middle line:84%
It was like that
kind of feels good.

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:26.057 align:middle line:90%
Nice little tune up, you know.

00:40:26.057 --> 00:40:28.326 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend that you stick
your finger in a wall socket,

00:40:28.326 --> 00:40:30.695 align:middle line:84%
but if we're energy,
which we are, you can tell

00:40:30.695 --> 00:40:32.396 align:middle line:84%
when you have high
energy, low energy.

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:33.798 align:middle line:84%
You can tell when you're
listening to George's show

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:35.399 align:middle line:84%
and you go, wow,
and you lean forward

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and you're not even there.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.702 align:middle line:90%
You ever had that happen?

00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:40.371 align:middle line:84%
Or the hair on your arm stands
up when you hear a certain song?

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:41.506 align:middle line:90%
That's all energy.

00:40:41.506 --> 00:40:42.807 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell when
you're around people --

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:45.710 align:middle line:84%
my mom used to say, birds
of a feather flock together.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.111 align:middle line:84%
I always say if you don't
like the flock you're with,

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:50.214 align:middle line:84%
tell them to flock off, but you
can tell when people bring you

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:51.616 align:middle line:84%
down and you can tell
when people lift you up.

00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:52.817 align:middle line:90%
That's energy.

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So, the electrical parts
of us that we all have --

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.788 align:middle line:84%
that's why they have
pacemakers, it's electrical.

00:40:57.788 --> 00:41:00.224 align:middle line:84%
So, the electrical
energy that went into me,

00:41:00.224 --> 00:41:02.860 align:middle line:84%
in some ways I kind of keep
it bouncing around inside me

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.696 align:middle line:84%
by the music I listen to, by
the people I hang out with,

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:07.331 align:middle line:90%
but the things that I read.

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:10.334 align:middle line:84%
We -- our bodies are fed
physically by what we eat,

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:13.504 align:middle line:84%
but our -- that energetic
body really does pick

00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:15.206 align:middle line:84%
up on our surroundings
and things that we --

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:17.174 align:middle line:84%
that we listen to
and tune in to.

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You did a
little work with Dr. Oz.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.244 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: I did.

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:22.079 align:middle line:90%
I did. Dr. Oz, as we call him.

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.214 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Good man.

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:23.881 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
He's a very good man.

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:25.550 align:middle line:90%
We call him Dr. Oz.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.918 align:middle line:90%
It's very nefarious.

00:41:26.918 --> 00:41:28.152 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That's because nobody
can pronounce his first name.

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:29.287 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:41:29.287 --> 00:41:30.821 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, Mehmet
in Turkish means John.

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:31.956 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:32.523 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
So, it's very common.

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:33.758 align:middle line:90%
But I did.

00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:36.227 align:middle line:84%
I did four years working
with the Oprah radio thing,

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:38.529 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of -- I've done
my own radio show for years,

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:40.731 align:middle line:84%
and years, and years, and I had
to kind of get out of that role,

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:42.967 align:middle line:84%
they needed me to coach these
people that were, kind of,

00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:45.703 align:middle line:84%
handpicked by the Oprah
staff to be on radio.

00:41:45.703 --> 00:41:47.371 align:middle line:84%
They're all great
four minute TV people.

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:48.573 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:49.373 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
But not in the long runs,

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:50.074 align:middle line:90%
they need different outlets.

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:51.208 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Different animal.

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.009 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Yeah, you got to kind

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:52.843 align:middle line:90%
of get to whip a chair out.

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:54.378 align:middle line:90%
And Mehmet's a fantastic guy.

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.113 align:middle line:84%
He's a world-renowned
heart surgeon,

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:57.782 align:middle line:90%
but he is much like I am.

00:41:57.782 --> 00:42:00.151 align:middle line:84%
We're both very much
Neanderthal knuckle draggers.

00:42:00.151 --> 00:42:02.753 align:middle line:84%
You need to push against
that, and so we had a --

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:04.722 align:middle line:84%
we still do, have a
great relationship.

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:07.692 align:middle line:84%
He said something -- he wrote
the forward to my second book,

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and in there he said
something that I heard him say

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.996 align:middle line:84%
to people a lot, and
it was very profound.

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:14.298 align:middle line:84%
He said that the human heart,
which he's very well-aware

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:17.768 align:middle line:84%
of how it works -- the very
first pump it has every time it

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:20.705 align:middle line:84%
pumps does not go out to the
veins and arteries of the body,

00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:22.573 align:middle line:84%
it goes back into
the heart itself,

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:24.976 align:middle line:90%
and it feeds itself first.

00:42:24.976 --> 00:42:26.811 align:middle line:90%
Humans don't do that.

00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:27.812 align:middle line:90%
We're -- I'll take care of you.

00:42:27.812 --> 00:42:28.546 align:middle line:90%
I'll take care of you.

00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:29.747 align:middle line:90%
I'll make you happy,

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:32.883 align:middle line:84%
and we lessen our energetic
field by doing that.

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:34.385 align:middle line:84%
So, working with
Mehmet those four years,

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.153 align:middle line:84%
and we stay in touch,
every month

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:39.290 align:middle line:84%
or so we talk, even
through email.

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.092 align:middle line:90%
When I watch him on TV now,

00:42:41.092 --> 00:42:44.195 align:middle line:84%
he said his first most important
mission is to keep people

00:42:44.195 --> 00:42:45.596 align:middle line:90%
out of the operating room.

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:48.633 align:middle line:84%
It's the last thing you want
to do, so he's a great guy,

00:42:48.633 --> 00:42:51.202 align:middle line:84%
a great friend, I'm
very, you know --

00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:52.903 align:middle line:84%
he gets on TV and
gives me credit for --

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.705 align:middle line:84%
he can talk for more
than seven minutes now.

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:55.973 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:57.041 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: So,
that's a good outcome, so.

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:58.442 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I have another
question for John.

00:42:58.442 --> 00:42:59.277 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:42:59.277 --> 00:43:00.277 align:middle line:90%
Yes, mam.

00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:00.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Sally: Hi, John.

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:01.912 align:middle line:90%
My name is Sally.

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Hi, Sally.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Sally: Hi.

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to get caught up
in the routine, in the drudgery

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.053 align:middle line:84%
of day-to-day life, and
so it's all about me, me,

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:11.389 align:middle line:84%
me and you were talking
about the we.

00:43:11.389 --> 00:43:13.924 align:middle line:90%
How can we get to the we

00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:15.760 align:middle line:84%
when we're dealing
with our daily lives?

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.827 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
When you're dealing with --

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:17.495 align:middle line:84%
trying to get out of
me and get into we?

00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:18.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Sally: Yeah.

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:19.597 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Yeah, and, you know,

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:21.432 align:middle line:84%
they came out with
game called Wii --

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:22.967 align:middle line:84%
I think there's more to
it then they realize.

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:24.935 align:middle line:90%
You know, doing something

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.370 align:middle line:84%
for somebody else is
always the easiest way,

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:27.972 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean your
kids, if you have kids.

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:29.206 align:middle line:90%
That's easy.

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:30.908 align:middle line:84%
That's that stuff that's
part of the Monday routine.

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:34.245 align:middle line:84%
But it's stretching yourself
where you usually don't stretch.

00:43:34.245 --> 00:43:35.246 align:middle line:90%
It's putting yourself

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:37.148 align:middle line:84%
in sometimes uncomfortable
positions,

00:43:37.148 --> 00:43:38.549 align:middle line:90%
because that's how we grow.

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:40.718 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a
kinesiology term --

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:43.554 align:middle line:84%
I was a trainer for years,
and when I would train people,

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:45.322 align:middle line:90%
there's a term called SAID --

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:47.191 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned this on your
show, when I was on.

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:50.261 align:middle line:84%
Specific Adaptation
to Imposed Demands --

00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:51.462 align:middle line:90%
and if you ever work out,

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:53.531 align:middle line:84%
that's what these workout
routines are all about.

00:43:53.531 --> 00:43:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Your body specifically adapts
to the demand you put on it,

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.902 align:middle line:84%
and so if you work out a lot
you'll look a certain way,

00:43:57.902 --> 00:43:59.036 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't, you
look a certain way.

00:43:59.036 --> 00:44:00.838 align:middle line:84%
It's very simple, but it
applies to our life too.

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:03.107 align:middle line:84%
That our life -- the
demand placed on our life,

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:05.176 align:middle line:84%
we've adapted to
that very quickly.

00:44:05.176 --> 00:44:10.314 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Macarena, if I
say, hey, you go Macarena --

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:12.116 align:middle line:90%
yeah, well okay, whatever,

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:14.285 align:middle line:84%
but that's an adaptive thing
it doesn't take very long

00:44:14.285 --> 00:44:15.052 align:middle line:90%
to get to.

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:16.454 align:middle line:90%
Humans adapt very quickly.

00:44:16.454 --> 00:44:17.855 align:middle line:84%
To get out of the
adaptive process,

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:19.090 align:middle line:90%
you've got to shake it up.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:22.093 align:middle line:84%
So, you see these guys doing
these ridiculous workout

00:44:22.093 --> 00:44:23.227 align:middle line:90%
routines, there's a reason.

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:24.862 align:middle line:84%
The body only takes
seven days to adapt,

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:28.099 align:middle line:84%
then when you shift it, the
body keeps changing, so people,

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:30.134 align:middle line:84%
for example, would go
park in the same spot,

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:32.503 align:middle line:84%
eat lunch at the same
time, sit at the same desk,

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.105 align:middle line:90%
do the same -- we're so adapted.

00:44:34.105 --> 00:44:37.108 align:middle line:84%
Your job, should you choose
to accept it, is either, A --

00:44:37.108 --> 00:44:39.710 align:middle line:84%
wait to get electrocuted
or a car accident,

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.746 align:middle line:84%
which will shake you
out of that, or B --

00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:43.647 align:middle line:84%
start finding little
things you can do to get

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:46.450 align:middle line:84%
in a un-comfort zone, because
we're in our comfort zones.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:49.754 align:middle line:84%
And most people say, you know,
we -- most people it'd be 75,

00:44:49.754 --> 00:44:51.055 align:middle line:84%
but we die when we're
20, we just don't go

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:52.823 align:middle line:90%
in the box for about 50 years.

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:54.258 align:middle line:84%
Got to get out of
the comfort zone.

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:56.127 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: [Background talking] Do
we need a near death experience

00:44:56.127 --> 00:44:56.961 align:middle line:90%
in our lives?

00:44:56.961 --> 00:44:57.962 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: No.

00:44:57.962 --> 00:44:59.063 align:middle line:84%
You asked me this
a couple a times.

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:00.131 align:middle line:84%
You know, these near
death experiences are

00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:02.099 align:middle line:84%
about getting you
nearer to life.

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.134 align:middle line:90%
For me they are.

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:04.535 align:middle line:90%
We don't need that.

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:07.538 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's examples,
and not that anybody's better

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:10.608 align:middle line:84%
or worse -- special or not
special -- gifted or not gifted,

00:45:10.608 --> 00:45:13.144 align:middle line:84%
but when you read about
someone who, you know,

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:15.413 align:middle line:84%
went through some
horrible experience, and --

00:45:15.413 --> 00:45:18.249 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago there was a
shooting as an Amish school,

00:45:18.249 --> 00:45:19.283 align:middle line:90%
and the Amish people came out

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:20.651 align:middle line:84%
and forgave these
people right way.

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:21.318 align:middle line:90%
Could you do that?

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:22.153 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: No.

00:45:22.153 --> 00:45:23.087 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Right.

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:24.321 align:middle line:84%
But there's an opportunity
to go,

00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:26.257 align:middle line:84%
that's way out of
my comfort zone.

00:45:26.257 --> 00:45:28.225 align:middle line:84%
I may not get to that
point, but what point --

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:30.261 align:middle line:84%
can I forgive the guy for
cutting me off in traffic.

00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:31.395 align:middle line:84%
You know, these things
are presented

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.130 align:middle line:90%
to us all these different ways

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:35.132 align:middle line:84%
on this giant blackboard
we call life,

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and all these lessons
keep showing up,

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.069 align:middle line:84%
and we're in class all
the time, until we're not.

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:41.939 align:middle line:84%
So these are opportunities that
we don't have to experience it,

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:45.376 align:middle line:84%
but because we're the we -- if
you're a parent, you hear that,

00:45:45.376 --> 00:45:46.944 align:middle line:84%
you're like, oh, your
heart's breaking.

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.078 align:middle line:90%
If you've ever had somebody --

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:50.481 align:middle line:84%
you've lost somebody
close, you feel it.

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.883 align:middle line:84%
So, that's how we feel
through each other

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:55.419 align:middle line:84%
and so that's how we can grow
from other people's experience

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:56.987 align:middle line:84%
without having to
get hit by a car.

00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:58.889 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take one
more question for John.

00:45:58.889 --> 00:45:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, mam.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.292 align:middle line:84%
>> Leslie: Hi, my
name is Leslie.

00:46:01.292 --> 00:46:02.493 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Hi, Leslie.

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:04.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Leslie: And I work
with horses and humans.

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:05.296 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Oh.

00:46:05.296 --> 00:46:07.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Leslie: So that
connection is a very --

00:46:07.298 --> 00:46:09.567 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling a lot of
vibrations from that and...

00:46:09.567 --> 00:46:10.835 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Sure.

00:46:10.835 --> 00:46:12.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Leslie: So, I was wondering
if you felt any closer

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:15.573 align:middle line:84%
to animals and that was
part of your way of,

00:46:15.573 --> 00:46:16.974 align:middle line:84%
maybe connecting more
with [inaudible],

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:18.843 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
the only species..

00:46:18.843 --> 00:46:19.643 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
You bet ya.

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:20.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Leslie:...on this planet.

00:46:20.845 --> 00:46:21.979 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
That's a perfect question.

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:26.217 align:middle line:84%
Thanks. I have a cat and
as Eckhart Tolle said,

00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:30.221 align:middle line:84%
he said I met several -- I
have met several Zen masters

00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:31.722 align:middle line:90%
in my life, they're all cats.

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:32.523 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.425 align:middle line:90%
And I have dogs.

00:46:34.425 --> 00:46:35.826 align:middle line:84%
And I've had dogs in my life,
and animals absolutely --

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:40.064 align:middle line:84%
you know, we think we're the
-- because we have everything,

00:46:40.064 --> 00:46:42.800 align:middle line:84%
we think we know everything,
and therefore we are everything,

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.603 align:middle line:84%
and you're right, we are the
youngest species on the planet,

00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:47.872 align:middle line:84%
and yet we have figured
out that we're at the top

00:46:47.872 --> 00:46:50.307 align:middle line:84%
of the food chain, which
isn't always the case.

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:51.775 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, I think
the connection

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:53.544 align:middle line:84%
through animals is
profound for me.

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:54.778 align:middle line:90%
I was already, kind of,

00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:57.548 align:middle line:84%
connected before those
things, even more so now.

00:46:57.548 --> 00:47:01.118 align:middle line:84%
If I can spend five minutes
with a dog -- forget the people,

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:03.854 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to the animals,
and Chief Dan George said,

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:05.189 align:middle line:84%
you know, a lot of a lot
of people talk to animals,

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:07.825 align:middle line:84%
but most don't listen, and
that's really what it's about.

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:10.494 align:middle line:84%
Horses -- oh my, I got goose
bumps thinking about that.

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:12.997 align:middle line:84%
You get time to spend around
those kind of creatures

00:47:12.997 --> 00:47:15.399 align:middle line:84%
that were here before
us -- think about this,

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:18.202 align:middle line:90%
in our present form as humans --

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.703 align:middle line:84%
putting aside all the
spiritual aspects,

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:23.474 align:middle line:84%
but the physical form we have
now, about 10,000 years --

00:47:23.474 --> 00:47:25.843 align:middle line:84%
we're the youngest
kids on the block.

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:28.178 align:middle line:84%
We act like we know
everything and we don't.

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:30.514 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
destroying the very systems

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:33.784 align:middle line:84%
that sustain our lives,
every one of those creatures

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:36.153 align:middle line:84%
that we share the planet with,
they're kind of the canary

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:38.889 align:middle line:84%
in the cage for what's
going on with the planet.

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:41.158 align:middle line:84%
We're doing it ourselves,
you know.

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Chief Seattle said if
you continue to crap

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.496 align:middle line:84%
in your own bed, one day you
suffocate in your own waste.

00:47:45.496 --> 00:47:46.597 align:middle line:90%
Not hard to figure out.

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:47.998 align:middle line:90%
But that's all ego-driven stuff.

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:50.134 align:middle line:84%
When you get out of that and you
start to see our place in this,

00:47:50.134 --> 00:47:53.704 align:middle line:84%
and when we're losing species
the way we are, and when we --

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:56.006 align:middle line:84%
these animals, kind of, you
know, you can watch what's going

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:58.709 align:middle line:84%
on in their lives, they're,
kind of, messengers for us,

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.778 align:middle line:84%
and if we don't pay attention,
one day we'll turn around

00:48:00.778 --> 00:48:02.112 align:middle line:84%
and go hey, guess
who's at the top

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:04.448 align:middle line:90%
of the endangered species list?

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:05.416 align:middle line:90%
Us.

00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:06.317 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I always like
those stories

00:48:06.317 --> 00:48:07.851 align:middle line:90%
where somebody's cat died.

00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:09.053 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:48:09.053 --> 00:48:10.454 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But they see the
paw prints on their bed...

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:11.288 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Oh, yes.

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:12.089 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: ...and stuff like that.

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:14.825 align:middle line:84%
I really -- you know, I 've had
a real interesting 36 months,

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:17.261 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to get into all
that, but this cat has been

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:19.330 align:middle line:84%
with me for 12 years and
the last three years,

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:20.731 align:middle line:90%
mostly just myself.

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:21.565 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That's a long
time for a cat.

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:22.333 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: It is.

00:48:22.333 --> 00:48:23.667 align:middle line:90%
And her name is Nanabozho.

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:25.869 align:middle line:84%
It means the trickster in
Ojibwa Native American language.

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.504 align:middle line:84%
Every morning it's
the same routine.

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:29.540 align:middle line:84%
She gets up and she sits
on my chest, and I --

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.242 align:middle line:84%
she just sits there and looks
at me and scares the hell

00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:34.345 align:middle line:84%
out of me, and I'm thinking
what are you trying to tell me,

00:48:34.345 --> 00:48:36.413 align:middle line:84%
because she always starts
the morning out like that,

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:38.916 align:middle line:84%
and to me, it's like -- even if
it's nothing more than going,

00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:41.652 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you woke up,
now you can feed me.

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:42.486 align:middle line:90%
I'll take it.

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's what she wants.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.688 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
That's exactly right.

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:45.689 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You don't think
much of psychics.

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:47.257 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Well, it's like this.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.966 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we all have
different vehicles

00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:59.303 align:middle line:84%
and everybody here came -- drove
in, or whatever, with somebody

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:01.138 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually one
of about eight models,

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and all the power plants
are basically the same,

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.842 align:middle line:84%
the cars just look
different on the outside.

00:49:04.842 --> 00:49:06.543 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have the
same basic power plant.

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:07.811 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have
the same wiring,

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:09.213 align:middle line:84%
but we have different
connections,

00:49:09.213 --> 00:49:11.215 align:middle line:84%
and I think when you look
to someone else instead

00:49:11.215 --> 00:49:13.017 align:middle line:84%
of developing your
own abilities --

00:49:13.017 --> 00:49:14.251 align:middle line:84%
you know, the gentleman
who drove me here.

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:15.486 align:middle line:90%
We have a great conversation

00:49:15.486 --> 00:49:17.388 align:middle line:84%
about things that
happened to him.

00:49:17.388 --> 00:49:19.890 align:middle line:84%
We all have things that
happen to us, but we rarely,

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.893 align:middle line:84%
especially men, acknowledge
it and it's like a faucet.

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.528 align:middle line:84%
So, when you don't acknowledge
it, the universe goes oh,

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:26.063 align:middle line:84%
you don't need it,
okay I'll turn it off.

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:29.800 align:middle line:84%
The more acknowledge it -- a
Dr. Ozism, I don't even know

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.869 align:middle line:84%
if you call it that, but I'll
call it that, he said, you know,

00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:33.303 align:middle line:84%
if you take a shower and
you've got a shower curtain

00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:35.305 align:middle line:84%
with the rings on it, when
you pull the first one,

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:36.507 align:middle line:90%
all the rest come.

00:49:36.507 --> 00:49:38.776 align:middle line:84%
So, in your life when
something psychic happens

00:49:38.776 --> 00:49:41.045 align:middle line:84%
or something weird
happens and you pull

00:49:41.045 --> 00:49:42.813 align:middle line:84%
that first ring, the
rest keep coming.

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:45.716 align:middle line:84%
You can accept them or
deny them as you wish.

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:48.919 align:middle line:84%
So going to someone else to tell
you what you probably already

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:50.421 align:middle line:90%
know, I find fascinating.

00:49:50.421 --> 00:49:52.256 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's wrong
or right, I'm just not a fan

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:55.392 align:middle line:84%
of developing your own GPS
-- your own inner guidance.

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:58.162 align:middle line:84%
We all have it, we just
ignore it most of the time.

00:49:58.162 --> 00:50:00.631 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing with -- you
know, I've had these experiences

00:50:00.631 --> 00:50:04.501 align:middle line:84%
of life after death, and I --
again this is no slam on anybody

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:08.105 align:middle line:84%
who does that, but if we spent
the time that we should spend

00:50:08.105 --> 00:50:10.874 align:middle line:84%
with people while we're here, we
wouldn't be so eager to go find

00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:12.409 align:middle line:90%
out if they're okay over there.

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:13.477 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's so true.

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:14.278 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
They're more okay

00:50:14.278 --> 00:50:15.679 align:middle line:90%
over there than we are here.

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:19.883 align:middle line:84%
You can't change that, so again,
the clock never goes backward.

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:21.485 align:middle line:84%
If you're lucky,
you get 28,000 days.

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I've had friends of mine
who left a lot earlier,

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I miss them terribly, but I
spent the time and squeezed it

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:27.958 align:middle line:84%
out with them, and then when
they're gone I go, got it,

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.159 align:middle line:90%
I'll see ya next time.

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:31.295 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Are you convinced
the other side does exist?

00:50:31.295 --> 00:50:32.062 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Absolutely.

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:32.896 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:34.231 align:middle line:90%
You know, I don't know what --

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:35.866 align:middle line:84%
everybody gets the proof in
the way they need to get it.

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.801 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing a lot of quote
thinkers, I apologize for that,

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.670 align:middle line:84%
but it -- everybody
gets the proof

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:40.571 align:middle line:90%
in the way that they need it.

00:50:40.571 --> 00:50:41.705 align:middle line:90%
Our blueprints are individual.

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.140 align:middle line:90%
You can have things show up.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.676 align:middle line:84%
I've had visitations and all
these other things from people,

00:50:45.676 --> 00:50:47.511 align:middle line:90%
and the more I say yes to it --

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:50.881 align:middle line:84%
you know, Nike was all
about just say -- say --

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.716 align:middle line:84%
there was that just
say no to drugs thing,

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:54.985 align:middle line:84%
that's good for drugs, but
saying no to life is not good,

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:56.720 align:middle line:84%
because then the
faucet gets turned off,

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.922 align:middle line:84%
and the more you accept
this stuff, the more --

00:50:58.922 --> 00:51:01.859 align:middle line:84%
the thinner the veil
-- or the curtain gets.

00:51:01.859 --> 00:51:03.193 align:middle line:90%
I love it now.

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:05.295 align:middle line:84%
I love running into things
and weird stuff happening.

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:06.830 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this is so cool.

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:08.632 align:middle line:84%
There is a there,
it's just not here.

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:11.768 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: In your book,
Living the Uncommon Life .

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:13.036 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yes.

00:51:13.036 --> 00:51:15.806 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You talk about 21
individuals you have affected

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:18.142 align:middle line:84%
your life in some
form or fashion.

00:51:18.142 --> 00:51:19.276 align:middle line:90%
Who's the number one?

00:51:19.276 --> 00:51:20.511 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Well, it's John Denver.

00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That was a tragic story.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.448 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: Well,
it's a tragic story, but it's --

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:27.584 align:middle line:84%
it's the kinds of thing
that never leaves you...

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:28.785 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's emotional for you.

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:31.121 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Very emotional, you know,

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:34.091 align:middle line:84%
it's like I said, you start out
at one level and then you work

00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:35.425 align:middle line:84%
through different
levels in life,

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:37.761 align:middle line:84%
and then these connections
come and you go, huh, huh, huh,

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:39.129 align:middle line:90%
you know, why is this happened.

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:40.964 align:middle line:84%
Not so much how it's happening,
but why is this happening?

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a kid growing up
in Chicago, for whatever reason,

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.402 align:middle line:90%
his music got into my head.

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:47.905 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know there was
a place that was, like here,

00:51:47.905 --> 00:51:50.641 align:middle line:84%
where there's mountains
and eagles and things,

00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:52.976 align:middle line:84%
and it just -- it got
in -- it seeped into me,

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:54.411 align:middle line:84%
and that's not normal
in Chicago,

00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:56.013 align:middle line:90%
and I kind of kept it to myself.

00:51:56.013 --> 00:51:59.216 align:middle line:84%
And years later, my aunt
lived in Wheat Ridge, Colorado

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:00.784 align:middle line:84%
and I got to meet
him at a fundraiser

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:02.186 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, oh that's great.

00:52:02.186 --> 00:52:04.755 align:middle line:84%
But it was just the beginning
of the iceberg kind of thing.

00:52:04.755 --> 00:52:07.991 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, got
more and more frequent,

00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and then there was an
organization called Windstar

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.697 align:middle line:84%
up in Aspen -- snow masks, and
they would do these symposiums

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:15.899 align:middle line:84%
and people from all over the
world, and John was a kind

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:18.235 align:middle line:84%
of celebrity and, you know,
his music touched people all

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:19.870 align:middle line:84%
over the world and people
came to these things

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:23.574 align:middle line:84%
and great thoughts, and Jacques
Cousteau and Ted Turner --

00:52:23.574 --> 00:52:25.776 align:middle line:84%
maybe shouldn't be in the same
sentence, but you get my drift.

00:52:25.776 --> 00:52:26.910 align:middle line:90%
All these great thinkers came

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.012 align:middle line:84%
and I thought this is
how the world could be.

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:30.647 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we
change our thoughts.

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:31.982 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:32.482 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: And
then we change how we approach

00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:33.550 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.118 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's that
tipping point stuff.

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:36.520 align:middle line:90%
It's that critical mass.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.990 align:middle line:84%
What if you get enough
people thinking at a level

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.792 align:middle line:84%
where things work, as
opposed to not working,

00:52:41.792 --> 00:52:43.460 align:middle line:90%
so John was all about that.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.897 align:middle line:84%
And I had a profound
experience in 1992.

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in Chicago --
I had met John over the years

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.503 align:middle line:84%
and all well and good,
watching the  Tonight Show ,

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:56.173 align:middle line:84%
and Jay Leno was in his early
years and he comes out and says,

00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:58.242 align:middle line:84%
I guess tonight is John Denver,
and he comes walking out,

00:52:58.242 --> 00:53:01.345 align:middle line:84%
and this voice says you have
to go meet him in Boston.

00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:04.348 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on the couch half asleep
when usually that stuff comes

00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:05.449 align:middle line:84%
when I have my [background
talking].

00:53:05.449 --> 00:53:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did you know
him well at that point?

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:07.618 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Well, I knew enough

00:53:07.618 --> 00:53:08.719 align:middle line:84%
that we knew each
other, you know, he...

00:53:08.719 --> 00:53:09.886 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: He recognized
you and stuff like that.

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:10.854 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Yeah, sure, you know,

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:11.955 align:middle line:84%
and first name basis
kind of thing.

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:14.358 align:middle line:90%
And I had gone past the music.

00:53:14.358 --> 00:53:16.727 align:middle line:84%
It was more about what he
was saying about who he was.

00:53:16.727 --> 00:53:18.095 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:53:18.095 --> 00:53:19.463 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: It was
what was coming through him.

00:53:19.463 --> 00:53:21.498 align:middle line:84%
And he had a phenomenal voice,
you know, five octave range,

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:23.267 align:middle line:84%
you just don't hear that
stuff anymore, so anyway,

00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:25.035 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff was there,
and he was going to be

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:27.904 align:middle line:84%
at the Wang Center
in Boston, and I --

00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:29.840 align:middle line:90%
the voice -- I have to go.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Why? Doesn't matter, so
I buy a ticket to Boston

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:36.013 align:middle line:84%
and a couple weeks later I
find myself at the Wang Center.

00:53:36.013 --> 00:53:38.382 align:middle line:84%
Chris O'Connor, John's road
manager, says what's up

00:53:38.382 --> 00:53:39.516 align:middle line:84%
and he says I'm here
to see John,

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:41.218 align:middle line:84%
he says do you have a
ticket to the concert --

00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:42.352 align:middle line:84%
I'm like no, he goes
why you here.

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:43.720 align:middle line:90%
I go, I don't know.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.222 align:middle line:84%
So, why, I mean, why
would I go all the way --

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:46.189 align:middle line:90%
it made no sense to me.

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:47.391 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:48.792 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Logically, it didn't ring,

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:50.727 align:middle line:84%
but inside the GPS was going,
you're in the right direction,

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:54.698 align:middle line:84%
and so I get to the concert and
he says I'll leave you a ticket.

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:56.967 align:middle line:84%
I get there, I'm
40 minutes early.

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:58.602 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful place,
the Wang Center.

00:53:58.602 --> 00:53:59.770 align:middle line:90%
John was such a giving guy.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:01.972 align:middle line:84%
He was doing a concert
for Catholic charities,

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.240 align:middle line:84%
raised a quarter
million in one night,

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.007 align:middle line:90%
you know, one of those deals.

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:05.275 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Good for him.

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:07.411 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: And
they come walking in late.

00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:09.313 align:middle line:84%
John comes walking in with
James Burton, his guitar player,

00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:11.548 align:middle line:84%
and he looks at me and he
goes, what are you doing here?

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:13.517 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking there'd be like
some sort of trumpets, you know,

00:54:13.517 --> 00:54:15.352 align:middle line:84%
like he -- here, I
know why you're here.

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:17.387 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't the case,
and because he was late

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:21.658 align:middle line:84%
because of weather, they said
well, he can't see you tonight.

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:24.094 align:middle line:84%
So I'm downstairs under -- he
goes like -- Chris says well,

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:26.296 align:middle line:84%
I can feed you and then I can
give you a ticket to the show.

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:28.398 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm downstairs
underneath the stadium --

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:31.368 align:middle line:84%
or the stage at the Wang
Center eating cheeseburgers,

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:32.903 align:middle line:84%
while the guitars are
being electronically tuned.

00:54:32.903 --> 00:54:34.671 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, I must
have crossed my wires.

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:35.372 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:36.573 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:37.274 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: So
I walked back upstairs,

00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:38.475 align:middle line:90%
and Chris is there --

00:54:38.475 --> 00:54:39.309 align:middle line:84%
I said well, where are
you going to be tomorrow?

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:40.110 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'll be in Pittsburgh.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.078 align:middle line:90%
I said well, I'll go there.

00:54:41.078 --> 00:54:42.346 align:middle line:90%
He goes okay.

00:54:42.346 --> 00:54:44.081 align:middle line:84%
Five -- five minutes
after the concert,

00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:46.950 align:middle line:84%
because I have no
idea why I'm there.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.286 align:middle line:84%
Concert's phenomenal,
go backstage,

00:54:49.286 --> 00:54:50.287 align:middle line:84%
all these people
waiting to see John.

00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:51.254 align:middle line:90%
I walk up, he gives me a hug,

00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:52.656 align:middle line:84%
and he says what
are you going here?

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:56.059 align:middle line:84%
And I thought he'd -- he would
know, like some profound thing.

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:57.327 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:54:57.327 --> 00:54:58.462 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Something [background talking].

00:54:58.462 --> 00:55:00.263 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you don't
know, and he goes no,

00:55:00.263 --> 00:55:02.132 align:middle line:90%
I don't know [laughter].

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:05.469 align:middle line:84%
And all of sudden it was
like I had these letters

00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:07.704 align:middle line:84%
in my pocket -- I had
been doing some speaking

00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:10.140 align:middle line:84%
about [inaudible] issues
around Chicago, and I --

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.541 align:middle line:84%
oh, I've got to give
him these letters,

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:13.643 align:middle line:84%
and I give him the letters and
he -- and he looks at them, and,

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:14.978 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're backstage
and people are looking

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:16.146 align:middle line:90%
at their watch waiting on him,

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.581 align:middle line:84%
and he gets this big
grin on his face.

00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:20.951 align:middle line:84%
You know, when John smiled
it was like a kid got

00:55:20.951 --> 00:55:21.852 align:middle line:90%
out of school early, you know.

00:55:21.852 --> 00:55:22.919 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
Like something --

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.355 align:middle line:84%
and something connected
with these letters.

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:26.957 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, we've
been trying to do something

00:55:26.957 --> 00:55:28.024 align:middle line:90%
like this at Windstar for years.

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.159 align:middle line:90%
You're doing it.

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.627 align:middle line:84%
We need to figure out
how to do it up there.

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:32.429 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was it.

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:33.230 align:middle line:90%
I delivered the mail.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Like a mailman.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:34.531 align:middle line:90%
I delivered the mail.

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.332 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:36.299 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Is that the message?

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
This is it.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.301 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I feel much better
okay, so I --

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:39.569 align:middle line:84%
we shook hands, we'll
stay in touch.

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:42.339 align:middle line:84%
He said go put the letters
in my bag, I do, I leave.

00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:43.673 align:middle line:90%
Life is grand.

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:45.609 align:middle line:84%
A couple weeks later, maybe
a month, I get a phone call

00:55:45.609 --> 00:55:47.010 align:middle line:90%
from the Windstar people.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.112 align:middle line:84%
John brought the letters, oh,
you know, mission accomplished.

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:50.247 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:55:50.247 --> 00:55:51.948 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
The universe is great.

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:52.783 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the end it.

00:55:52.783 --> 00:55:54.351 align:middle line:90%
That was the beginning of it.

00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:58.488 align:middle line:84%
Two years later, I had to go
in to the Windstar Events,

00:55:58.488 --> 00:56:01.658 align:middle line:84%
driving from Chicago
-- my family and I,

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:04.561 align:middle line:84%
and early in 1994 I was
teaching high school

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.596 align:middle line:84%
and the Windstar
Event that year --

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:09.132 align:middle line:84%
I got a flyer in the mail
that said Windstar "Choices

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:12.335 align:middle line:84%
For The Future: The Human
Family" and something happened

00:56:12.335 --> 00:56:15.472 align:middle line:84%
in my head, and I went to
class, and I kind of floated

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:16.606 align:middle line:84%
through the day and
by the time I got home

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:20.310 align:middle line:84%
that night, I had
written lyrics.

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:24.314 align:middle line:90%
I don't write lyrics, at all.

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:26.483 align:middle line:84%
I wrote lyrics called
the human family.

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:29.686 align:middle line:84%
Came right out and I folded
it up and put it away,

00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:32.722 align:middle line:84%
and I somehow knew at some point
I was supposed to do something

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:34.124 align:middle line:84%
with them at this
event in August.

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:36.660 align:middle line:90%
This was in May.

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.094 align:middle line:84%
All summer I rode
the rollercoaster --

00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:39.329 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to be there,
not supposed to be there,

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.798 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be there,
and it went crazy.

00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:43.233 align:middle line:84%
So finally, two weeks
before the event,

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:46.136 align:middle line:84%
I'm cleaning the cat box
-- a very Zen-like thing,

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:47.237 align:middle line:90%
cleaning the cat box --

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:50.373 align:middle line:84%
different cat, and the
phone rings upstairs

00:56:50.373 --> 00:56:52.075 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't even have like
an answering thing, or whatever

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and I -- it was one of those
rings, you know, you get like,

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:54.845 align:middle line:90%
I've got to answer this.

00:56:54.845 --> 00:56:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So I went upstairs, and
it was John's office,

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.316 align:middle line:84%
and they said Mr. Denver
asked us to call --

00:56:59.316 --> 00:57:00.450 align:middle line:84%
are you coming out to
Windstar this year?

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.587 align:middle line:84%
I said yeah, planning
on it in two weeks, yep.

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:07.357 align:middle line:84%
They said well, Dr. Mae Jemison,
first female black astronaut

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:08.558 align:middle line:90%
in history, cancelled today.

00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:10.060 align:middle line:84%
John says you're
supposed to speak.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.663 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been on the radio,
hadn't written a book.

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:14.965 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: None of that
had happened.

00:57:14.965 --> 00:57:16.299 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: None
of that had happened yet.

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:18.401 align:middle line:84%
So, instead of going out there,
somehow these tumblers got

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:21.738 align:middle line:84%
in line and I finally, two
weeks later, found myself flying

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:25.809 align:middle line:84%
out to Aspen, getting up
in front of 3,000 people

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:26.743 align:middle line:90%
at the Aspen Music Tent.

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:29.012 align:middle line:84%
This is way out of
my comfort zone,

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:32.215 align:middle line:84%
and I delivered the
human family that day --

00:57:32.215 --> 00:57:33.383 align:middle line:90%
that morning, it was 45 minutes.

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:34.584 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Were you nervous?

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:35.418 align:middle line:90%
>> John St. Augustine: Yeah.

00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:36.786 align:middle line:90%
I was very nervous, you know.

00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:39.623 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what is this, you
know, and so John invited me

00:57:39.623 --> 00:57:42.125 align:middle line:84%
to come out and he put in
place -- but I want to --

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.994 align:middle line:84%
when I get to this point when
I tell this story to people,

00:57:43.994 --> 00:57:46.263 align:middle line:84%
I go back to Boston, and
something he said to me

00:57:46.263 --> 00:57:49.633 align:middle line:84%
that was profound that put
that in place two years later.

00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:50.967 align:middle line:90%
When I gave him those letters --

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.035 align:middle line:84%
this is where I always
have a hard time.

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:53.870 align:middle line:90%
I try to skip it, but I can't.

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.071 align:middle line:90%
When I gave him the --

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:57.274 align:middle line:84%
when I gave him the
letters, he looked at them.

00:57:57.274 --> 00:57:59.242 align:middle line:84%
He looked up at me
and he said --

00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:01.278 align:middle line:84%
he put his hand on
my shoulder --

00:58:01.278 --> 00:58:04.281 align:middle line:84%
forgive me, I just --
I see it, you know.

00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:06.516 align:middle line:84%
He put his hand on my shoulder
and he says do you know

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:08.718 align:middle line:90%
that your voice matters?

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:10.554 align:middle line:90%
No one ever told me that.

00:58:10.554 --> 00:58:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that
your voice matters?

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:14.991 align:middle line:90%
I said no, I don't.

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:19.863 align:middle line:84%
He said the coming years will
prove me right, and to this day,

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I spend most of my
time reminding people

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.902 align:middle line:84%
that our voices matter,
because no one ever told me

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:26.937 align:middle line:84%
and when it came
right to the point --

00:58:26.937 --> 00:58:28.838 align:middle line:84%
and not only did
he tell me that,

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:30.740 align:middle line:84%
he gave me the platform
to do it.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:34.444 align:middle line:84%
And, George it was off that
morning in Aspen in August

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.613 align:middle line:84%
of 1994 that everything
else came --

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.548 align:middle line:84%
the books, radio,
TV, the speaking.

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:39.516 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It all clicked.

00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:40.917 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine:
All clicked,

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:43.420 align:middle line:84%
so the connect the dots is one
thing, but we also play a game

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.155 align:middle line:84%
of tag, you're it,
while we're alive.

00:58:45.155 --> 00:58:47.324 align:middle line:84%
And without that, I wouldn't
be sitting here today.

00:58:47.324 --> 00:58:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And how sad,
when we lost him, John.

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:54.264 align:middle line:84%
How sad. If people want
more information on you,

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:55.966 align:middle line:84%
and where they can
look at your works.

00:58:55.966 --> 00:58:57.267 align:middle line:84%
>> John St. Augustine: And they
can see the hate mail you sent

00:58:57.267 --> 00:58:58.234 align:middle line:90%
me that I posted on the website.

00:58:58.234 --> 00:58:59.035 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: The hate mail
that I sent you.

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.236 align:middle line:90%
I don't send out hate mail.

myself to his every day,

you know, it's not
what happens to you,

00:59:36.006 --> 00:59:37.974 align:middle line:84%
it really is your response,
and in your response

if your opportunity to grow
like you never had the chance.

reason, and sometimes it's there

us to overcome, not be consumed.

It doesn't reveal us.

00:59:48.018 --> 00:59:50.053 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't define you,
it should reveal you

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:51.154 align:middle line:90%
and that's where we grow.
