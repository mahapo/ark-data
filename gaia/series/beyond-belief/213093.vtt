>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.210 align:middle line:10%
Lynn Monet is with us,
the author of the highly

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:10%
rated series "Omnipresent"
and the "Colors of Heaven,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:10%
Beginnings Never End."

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:84%
She can see spirits, and
has been a hospice nurse

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:90%
for more than 25 years.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Lynne, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNN MONET: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I really, really have
been looking forward

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.968 align:middle line:90%
to being here with you today.

00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They call you
the paranormal consultant.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: People reach out
to me for various things.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:84%
If they feel that they have a
haunting in their house, a lot

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
of times, they reach out to
me to determine what it is

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and how to get it out,
if it can be gotten out.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:10%
Also, people are
reaching out to me now--

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm working with a
person on mental illness,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:10%
and schizophrenia,
and addiction,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:10%
and how demonic attachments
and other disembodied souls

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:10%
attach and create problems
for people that way.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing several
other things as well.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can
feel these entities

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:90%
when you walk into a house?

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: I can, and I
can see them as well.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I have--

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You' like the
lady in "Poltergeist."

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.503 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: I guess so, yeah.

00:01:19.503 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you ever get scared?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: No.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I've had this gift ever
since I was a little girl.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
When I was age
five, my brother--

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
where I was living,
first of all,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
we lived three short
blocks behind a hospital.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So it was commonplace for
my brother and sisters and I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to see people in patient
bed gown gowns walking

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
through the house.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't really think
that it was abnormal.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they dead?

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: They were
dead people, yes.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.643 align:middle line:90%
The spirits of people in gowns.

00:01:46.643 --> 00:01:48.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Five years
old you saw this?

00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: I was.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I was five years old.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I was in my parent's master
bedroom in my mother's jewelry

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
box, and my brother was on the
floor playing with his cars,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Matchbox or whatever
they had back then.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was decorating
myself, and I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
turned to show my brother how
glamorous I had made myself.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he's
fixated on the wall.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So I turned to look at
the wall, and there's

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
this ectoplasm that is
starting to form, which I--

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:90%
like a misting.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And in that misting, stepped in
my brother's best friend, John,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.750 align:middle line:84%
John's mother,
father and brother.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And so my brother and
I got up and we ran out

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
of the bedroom
screaming for my mother.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I went in one direction, my
brother went into the other.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And he found her first.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And I hear him saying
to my mom, Mom.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Mom, John and his
family is here.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, well, I
didn't even hear them knock.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.558 align:middle line:84%
And he says, and
they're in your bedroom.

00:02:37.558 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And she's like,
they're in my bedroom?

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Who let them in my bedroom?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So they came to the bedroom, and
of course, nothing was there.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that was
ironic is the very,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:84%
very next day is my brother
went back to school--

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.290 align:middle line:84%
it was the first day
after spring break--

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and he was on the bus, and
little John was not on the bus.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
They sat together on the bus.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And then when he got
to class, their desks

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.560 align:middle line:84%
were side by side
in the classroom,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:90%
and John wasn't there either.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And after they said the
Pledge of Allegiance,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
the teacher stood up
in front of the class

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and stated that John would
not be returning to school

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
because he and his entire family
perished in an auto accident.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And it happened that
day that we saw him

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and his parents and his
brother show up in the bedroom.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So it was as if they were
coming to say goodbye.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:84%
There was a period
that I did go through

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:90%
that I was afraid of spirits.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I was born and
raised Presbyterian,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and my mother took a jaunt
with a different religion

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:90%
that didn't believe in spirits.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was placed up in front
of the elders of that church

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and told that I was possessed,
and what I was seeing

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
was demons, and
terrible things were

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to
me at 10 years old.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And it scared me so badly
that even though I still

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
continued to see
things, I would run out

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
of the room just as
fast as anybody else

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.652 align:middle line:90%
that, oh, it's a ghost.

00:03:56.652 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you weren't
an evil kid, were you?

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: No, no.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.647 align:middle line:90%
I was a really good kid.

00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:90%
I was a really, really good kid.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That scared the
living daylights out of you.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: It did.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.915 align:middle line:84%
To be told that and be in a
room surrounded by eight men,

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and you're 10 years
old standing there,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
it was very traumatic for
me to have that happen.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you involved
in studying life after death?

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: Well, a
couple of things.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
As a single mother, I purchased
a house, unbeknownst to me,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:90%
that was haunted.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And that opened
up things for me,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
because then I was
able to connect

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:90%
with people of like mind.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that I
wasn't so strange after all,

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that there were
other people like me.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
enhance my gifts

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and focus more on retrieving
some of what I lost as a child.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've been a nurse for
a very, very long time,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and 25 years of that has
been an end-of-life care.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And with the gifts that
I have of second sight,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to help a
lot of people cross over.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I've seen hundreds, if not
1,000 people pass away.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them come
out of their bodies.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen some very, very,
very beautiful things occur

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
at the time of death
that made me want

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
to write the book to help
take the stigma of death

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:90%
and dying away.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And to help people,
too, that maybe

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
have lost someone or maybe
have terminal illness

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to help them not be so
afraid of death itself.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you've seen all
kinds of things, haven't you?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: I have.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:90%
I have seen a lot of things.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:90%
But there's a beauty to death.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And so many times working
in end-of-life care,

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:84%
as I have worked for many, many
years, I've seen so many things

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and been able to be
part of so many things.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:84%
People even coming back
and forth during the time

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.040 align:middle line:84%
that they're rallying
and talking about things

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:84%
that they've seen
on the other side.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And they come back
and they start talking

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:90%
about what they've seen.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Or actually, even seeing
people come out of their bodies

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the loved ones come
to connect with their families,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and to come and help
them cross over.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
break the belief system

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
that you were dealing
with evil entities?

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: When I purchased that
house that I wrote the book

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
"Omnipresent" about, I was
placed into a position where I

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.060 align:middle line:90%
was meeting now with people--

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.520 align:middle line:84%
in search of trying
to find someone

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
to help me with that
house, I was now

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.570 align:middle line:84%
getting involved with
people of common--

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:90%
of a belief system of--

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Similar to yours?

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Similar to mine.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So then I was able to
then learn more about it

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and felt more
comfortable with it.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever convince
your mother this was OK?

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:84%
After she got older and she
kind of divorced herself

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
from the religion that she
had gotten involved in she

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.880 align:middle line:90%
started to believe it.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially after
that thing happened

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:84%
with John and my brother and
I seeing it at the same time.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.780 align:middle line:84%
But still I was born back in
the '60s, and back in the '60s,

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:84%
you just didn't talk
about stuff like that

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:84%
because you would literally
have the men with white coats

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.650 align:middle line:84%
coming to your house and
taking you away for lobotomy.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So, it was all
about the Joneses.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So you kept those
things under wraps.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
You didn't really talk
about those sorts of things.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever heard
of people speaking to the dead?

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, one thing
that really, really brought it

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
home for me as a nurse is
I was working on the unit,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I had had a patient named
Edna that had been on my unit

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:90%
for about two weeks.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that can't be disputed

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:84%
because so many times,
the medical field

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.605 align:middle line:84%
sees these as hallucinations,
people that are talking about--

00:07:38.605 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or mental illness.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: Or mental
illness, exactly.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.400 align:middle line:90%
And I had a patient, Edna.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:90%
She was totally blind.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
She had been totally
blind for 10 years

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and she couldn't see
shadows or anything.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And she'd been on my
unit for two weeks.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
She was kind of in that stage
going into the transition stage.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And her son and daughter
came to the nurses' station

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and they said to me,
Mom's talking to people

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:90%
in the room that aren't there.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, I kind of expected that.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I can't come out
and say that, so I told them,

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.283 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, let me walk with
you down to your mama's room

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and see if I can
get her something

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:90%
to make her more comfortable.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we walked
into the room,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Edna was laying at a slant, and
she was smiling from ear to ear.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And she was reaching
up into the sky

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:84%
as if she was being handed
something very, very delicate

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
because she was being very
careful with whatever it was.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said to Edna,
I said, Edna--

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, who's here?

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:90%
And she said, George.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happened,
same name as yours.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wasn't me.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: No, it wasn't.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:90%
Her husband's name was George.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And the daughter turned as white
as a sheet and had to sit down.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.883 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
George is my father.

00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: George died, right?

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: My father's been
dead for x amount of years.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and then Edna spoke
up and she said,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and he's glad that you're
taking good care of Pixie.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Pixie was Edna's poodle.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
When George passed
away, the son had

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
to take possession of
Pixie, the poodle who

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
was an elderly dog now, but
still very, very much alive.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And he told me the story
because Edna couldn't

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:90%
care for the dog being blind.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And the son said to
me, he said, do you

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
think that my mom
is hallucinating?

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I can't
come out and say, no, I

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:90%
don't think she's hallucinating.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I think your father is here.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:90%
So I handed it back.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, do you think
that she's hallucinating?

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, I don't know.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, do you
mind if I try something?

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm not trying to
change your religious beliefs,

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:84%
but in my experience,
loved ones do come in

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to help souls that are
transitioning over.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind if
I try something?

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Edna, I said, Edna,
can I ask George a question?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:90%
And she nodded her head yes.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what color
is your son's shirt?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yellow.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was wearing a yellow
Ralph Lauren Polo shirt.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And the son got
it in that moment.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And he said, hi, dad.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:84%
He realized that the only way
that his mother could have known

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
that is if his father had told
her because she couldn't see it

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:90%
for herself.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And people with
the medical field,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.060 align:middle line:84%
how can a blind
person hallucinate?

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:90%
They can't see.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So to me, this really
brought it home for me.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've had many, many other
examples along that line that

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:90%
were eye opening.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it
about the other side,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.148 align:middle line:84%
the afterlife, that
fascinates you the most?

00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Oh, my goodness.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:90%
So many things.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of Edna, too, there are
so many times during that time

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
when somebody is transitioning
that people miss out

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:84%
on that they have an
opportunity to communicate

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:84%
with loved ones on the
other side themselves.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:84%
When a person is going
through that transition,

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
the filters efface and
they're able to hear

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:84%
the telepathy from
the spiritual world,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
as well as the human embodied
souls speaking as well.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And with that, they
can communicate

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:90%
with the spirits themselves.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many times have
you heard somebody say,

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could tell so-and-so
that I'm sorry one more time,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:84%
or that I love them, or ask
Uncle Bob where the clock is.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:90%
This is your chance.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And so many times
people miss it.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But getting to be a part
of the loved ones coming

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.470 align:middle line:84%
in and the angels-- and there
are other beings to where

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
the galactic meets the spirit,
because there are other souls

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
when my mother passed away
that came in to collect her.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.510 align:middle line:84%
They were these big,
tall, beautiful beings

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that walked along with the
angels but didn't have wings.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And they appeared to
come from somewhere else.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.217 align:middle line:84%
They were gorgeous, very tall,
white hair, beautiful faces.

00:11:50.217 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, is you've
got to think about it.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
With as many stars as
there are out in the world

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that there are solar
systems around them.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.795 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
ignorant to think

00:11:58.795 --> 00:12:00.045 align:middle line:90%
that we're the only ones here.

00:12:00.045 --> 00:12:00.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: And those
beings also have

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.010 align:middle line:84%
to go somewhere when they
finish their lifetime

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and where they're at
and what they're doing.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And we are energy.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:90%
We are created of energy.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to take it
from a scientific angle,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So those beings also,
when they finish,

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:90%
have to go somewhere too.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So there are some very,
very beautiful beings

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:84%
on the other side in addition
to the more human looking ones.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say
that the galactic comes

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
in with the spiritual and
that everybody's right.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.637 align:middle line:84%
So you've got that
galactic spiritual thing.

00:12:38.637 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's kind of that
divide, but it really all

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:90%
comes together.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lynn, at this point,
what is the dying process

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.003 align:middle line:90%
mean to you?

00:12:46.003 --> 00:12:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: There are
various things.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.045 align:middle line:84%
There is, of course,
the physical side,

00:12:49.045 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:84%
which is what you
can see physically

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
of the body transitioning
and the body changing itself.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
the spiritual side

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.450 align:middle line:84%
where they're
transitioning, but yet you

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
start to see the loved ones
coming in to assist them

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and to help them cross over.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And when people are getting
ready, or close to their time

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:84%
to cross over, they will
start talking about it.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, oh, well, so and
so, will you take care of my dog

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:90%
if something happens to me?

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Or like, for instance,
in the case of my mother,

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%
she started going around the
facility that she was staying in

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
and she was telling people,
I'm going to go home tomorrow.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough, she did.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
She passed away at 1:30
something the next day.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But she even went so far to
tell one lady that had just

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:84%
had her dog put down three days
earlier that she would care

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
for the dog for the woman
until the woman could actually

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:84%
get there to retrieve
the dog when she had

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:90%
her time to transition over.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So people do have an
awareness, a lot of times,

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
of when their time is
going to come closer to--

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think happens to the soul

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:90%
when we cross over?

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: We simply shed our
skin and step out of it.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.010 align:middle line:90%
The soul is eternal.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:84%
The soul is-- the
soul doesn't age.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:90%
It's always eternal.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:90%
And we just go on.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:90%
It's just simple shedding.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a relief to
most people, especially

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:84%
those that have come back
from near-death experiences

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about
the relief when

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.952 align:middle line:90%
they exit the physical body.

00:14:16.952 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in reincarnation, Lynn?

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: I do.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe in incarnation
and reincarnation.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:90%
And there is a difference.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
that difference?

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: The difference is,
is people that reincarnate

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.140 align:middle line:90%
come here for a purpose.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.465 align:middle line:84%
They have an actual plan of some
goals that they need to meet.

00:14:32.465 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or something that
they left out of another life?

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.257 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: Yes, or even a karmic
thing that needs to be met,

00:14:37.257 --> 00:14:39.010 align:middle line:90%
or that sort of thing.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:84%
People that incarnate
volunteer to come here.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.210 align:middle line:90%
They choose to come here.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
They are chosen to
come here out of people

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:90%
that volunteer to come here.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And they come here more so
to help guide and teach.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to reincarnate.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
When people that are
incarnates cross over,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
reincarnating and incarnating

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:84%
on that part is
the reincarnating

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
people have to go through a
form of schooling, of course,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:84%
after they've gone
through their life review

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and the Akashic records
they go through.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And they also get to
see things that they--

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:90%
opportunities that they missed.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the person
that incarnates will go

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.368 align:middle line:90%
through more of a debriefing.

00:15:18.368 --> 00:15:19.952 align:middle line:84%
They'll go through
the similar things,

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:90%
but more of a debriefing.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And then to them,
heaven almost turns

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
into an airport where
they just go off

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.107 align:middle line:84%
to other galaxies
and other places

00:15:28.107 --> 00:15:29.440 align:middle line:90%
that-- wherever they want to go.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why our
house is haunted?

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: I learned that with
the house that I was living,

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
it's not about the
age of the house.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It's about the age of the
ground that it's built on.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So even a brand new house, if
it's built in the wrong place--

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
it's built over.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:84%
There is vortexes,
there are ley lines.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.300 align:middle line:90%
There are all kinds of things.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cemeteries.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes, absolutely.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Indian burial grounds.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:56.047 align:middle line:84%
So you got to check your
ground even before your house.

00:15:56.047 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
some of the things

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
that are negative that
happen within a house

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.950 align:middle line:84%
are caused because
they're already haunted.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The act doesn't
bring the haunting,

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
the haunting's are already
there that creates the act.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Like the house that
I had purchased,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
a young man had hung
himself in the house

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:90%
and there were two demons.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drove him to that?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: I believe that it
was the presence in the house.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.690 align:middle line:84%
There were actually two
demons in that house.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
people, when they

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.405 align:middle line:84%
get a ghost in their house,
the first thing that they say

00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, I've got a
demon in my house.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So even
can promote that?

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes, absolutely.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:90%
They can encourage.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:84%
They have a negative
vibration about them that--

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and they can talk to them
while they're sleeping

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:90%
and encourage them to do that.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
The negative pull that
they have, most definitely.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they thrive on
the act of the person--

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.670 align:middle line:84%
the sorrow that it creates and
the grieving that it creates,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
they feed on that
negativity, and it enables

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:90%
them to do more physical acts.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens if a soul
doesn't want to cross over?

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: They don't
have to cross over.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.097 align:middle line:84%
Just like in life, they
have the freedom to choose.

00:17:04.097 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And most of those people
usually are the ones that

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:90%
will end up haunting houses.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.109 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
reasons why some of them

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:90%
choose not to cross over.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, those that
haunt, were they good people

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:90%
when they were alive?

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Sometimes, yes.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:90%
A lot of times, people are--

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
choose to stay earthbound
because sometimes

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
of addiction, sometimes
feeling not worthy

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:84%
because of religious beliefs
that have instilled in them

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
worthy to pass over.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So they'd rather stay in that
realm of the fourth dimension

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.460 align:middle line:84%
than cross over and meet
their maker in their mind.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And there are also
other things, too.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people will
be caring for someone

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and expect that person to go,
and then all of a sudden they

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:90%
go first.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And then when the person that
they were caring for then

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
crosses over, the initial
caretaker gets stuck here,

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of lose their way
and forget how to cross over.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
I had a patient that
was actively passing.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:90%
I had my med card.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I was in front of the
room getting something

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:84%
for the lady that
was transitioning,

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and I see the spirit peering
out from around a pillar

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:90%
in a sitting area.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.245 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
I said, hello.

00:18:17.245 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, hey, are you there.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, why haven't
you crossed over?

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he's
looking over his shoulder

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.710 align:middle line:84%
to see who I'm talking to
because nobody has probably

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
spoken to him in
about 100 years.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:84%
He appeared to be dressed in
clothes like from the 1800s.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:90%
He was a younger fella.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It looked like he was
about 35, handsome man.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And he started to make
his way over to my card,

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:84%
eventually, after I
kind of coaxed him.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, I said, so
why haven't you crossed over?

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:90%
You can cross over.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:10%
And because he had not crossed
over, the cause of death

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:10%
still showed.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:10%
So he had a Swiss
cheese appearance

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:10%
to his abdomen,
which indicated to me

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:10%
a corrosive disease like cancer,
or cirrhosis of the liver

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:10%
was what caused his death.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:84%
They also continue to have
their addiction issues.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Their mental illness,
they still have.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
keep our senses.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
In death, the sense
of smell is more

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
of a memory recall than
an actual scent thing

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have
an olfactory nerve.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of this
gentleman, I told him, I said,

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:84%
This lady's getting
ready to pass.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can help
you cross over.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- in a very
heavy Irish brogue,

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:84%
he says, me lady,
I can't cross over.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, sure you can.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you can.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.940 align:middle line:90%
I can help you cross over.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:90%
And he says, no.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:84%
He says, my wife and my
mistress are on the other side

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.817 align:middle line:84%
and neither one knew
about the other.

00:19:36.817 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
waiting for him, huh?

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Right.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So he stayed
earthbound because he

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to go and have to be
confronted about his infidelity.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.098 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even in the spirit
world you get confronted?

00:19:46.098 --> 00:19:46.898 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes.

00:19:46.898 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, if he were to cross over,
he would have been confronted.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:90%
So he decided not to cross over.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And he just stayed
wandering the Earth.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes when
your loved ones die,

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
we never get contact
from them again.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: They're
always around us.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just some people are more
sensitive to it than others.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:84%
There are ways that you can
create contact, such as making

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.040 align:middle line:90%
a pact with them.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I made a pact with my mother
before she passed away.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:84%
But people can also
make a pact with people

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that have crossed over because
they can hear you talking.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:84%
With my mother,
I had asked her--

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
she had cancer in the
year before she passed.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sorry to hear that.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Thank you.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
We were checking off her
bucket list, and I asked her,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:90%
I said, Mom--

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, life gets
stressful and I'd kind of

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
like to know when you're here
and I'm not paying attention

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:90%
that you're really here.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So she had long hair like
mine, only hers was pearlescent

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:90%
white, very long, wavy hair.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.562 align:middle line:84%
And I said, would you please
leave one of your hairs?

00:20:47.562 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, this is
when she was still alive?

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: When she
was still alive.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.795 align:middle line:84%
But you can still do it, even
though they've crossed over

00:20:52.795 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:90%
because they can hear you.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily a hair,
but you can pick something.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:90%
A ladybug or a feather.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
My sister, who recently
passed away, leaves feathers.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So with my mother, the
day of her funeral,

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:90%
I drew a bath with some bubbles.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And on top of the bath laying
lengthwise was one of her hairs.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: And even three
years after that, I

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:84%
had gone back to school to
further my education as a nurse.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I also have a degree
in biological science.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was going
into a psych class.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a very,
very difficult test

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that I was taking that day that
I didn't feel prepared for.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But before I went
into the classroom,

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I had stopped at the
student bookstore

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and I had picked up a binder
out of thousands of them

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:84%
in multiple colors, and
some loose leaf papers

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:84%
to put into the
three ring binder.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And I went straight from
the bookstore to my car

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:90%
to the classroom.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And I sat down.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And when I opened up
that three-ring binder,

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:84%
one of my mother's hairs was
looped in the center ring

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.210 align:middle line:90%
of the teeth of that binder.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way that the
hair could have gotten there.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, out of
thousands that I picked,

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:84%
what are the chances that
some loose hair was just

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:90%
stuck in there like that?

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And even if it was,
it brought me comfort.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Astronomical.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So they are around, and
she was letting me know.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:84%
I took comfort in the fact that
she was there and supporting me

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:90%
through that difficult time.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still today--
at Thanksgiving,

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
my mom's been gone
for almost 10 years,

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and I found one
of her long hairs

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:84%
across the dining room
chair at Thanksgiving.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you have
felt left out had you not

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:90%
gotten any signs at all?

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: I would have.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.490 align:middle line:84%
When my mother did
pass away and I

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:84%
watched her come
out of her body,

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:84%
it was such a beautiful thing to
see all of the loved ones coming

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.185 align:middle line:90%
up to greet her.

00:22:42.185 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were many of
them that I recognized myself.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the ones
that I didn't recognize,

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.140 align:middle line:90%
she knew who they were.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in the presence
of those spirits, the love

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and the elation that
comes over, there

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:84%
are no human words
that can describe it

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:90%
or a feeling that can touch it.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.033 align:middle line:90%
It's such a beautiful thing.

00:23:03.033 --> 00:23:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Something that you
feel like that you've

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:84%
missed that you didn't realize
how long you were missing it

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:90%
until you experience it.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
there smiling--

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
help but smile when

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:84%
you're in the presence of that--
and I'm watching my mother.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And I turn to look and I notice
that her physical body has

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.240 align:middle line:90%
stopped breathing in her bed.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking to
myself, wow, I better

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.120 align:middle line:84%
call a nurse because
if a nurse walks in,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.190 align:middle line:84%
my mother has just passed away
and I'm sitting here smiling.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:90%
That's not a normal response.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're going to
think you did something.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Exactly.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like-- but to
me, she wasn't dead

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:84%
because I could see her
standing right there.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching her and
she's just very happy

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:84%
having these people come
up and approach her.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And, in that moment I
did, I'm like, please,

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to come
to the party, too.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:84%
There was this beautiful
reception that had been created,

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:90%
and a reunion for her.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.028 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted in that moment
to jump into it as well.

00:23:55.028 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Not that I wanted to leave,
because I have-- single mom

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:84%
with children, and I had--
needed to take care of those.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But just for the day, I
wouldn't have minded going.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So when the nurse came in
and pronounced her dead,

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:84%
I asked if I could stay in
the room for a little while

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:84%
because the festivities
were still going on

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:90%
for almost 20 minutes our time.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there is
no time on the other side.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.145 align:middle line:84%
Things here are linear, but
they're not on the other side.

00:24:18.145 --> 00:24:19.620 align:middle line:90%
But I got to see everything.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I got to see my mother exit.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.600 align:middle line:84%
That's how I saw those spirits,
those beautiful, tall ones that

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:90%
were just magnificent.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.418 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
happens, though, when

00:24:26.418 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:90%
a spirit decides to move on?

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Does it ever come back again?

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: It does.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, and again, that
depends on whether they're

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:84%
a reincarnate or an
incarnate, and where

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.480 align:middle line:84%
they are in their
spiritual journey,

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
in their collective
consciousness.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can it reincarnate and
still come back, or is it gone?

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: No.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:90%
We're never gone.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we shed our bodies
and then we cross over.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:90%
So our spirit, our energy--

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.188 align:middle line:84%
our spirits are always
there no matter what.

00:24:54.188 --> 00:24:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And our loved ones
are around us all.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.313 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, what
I don't understand,

00:24:57.313 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Lynn, is how could a
spirit reincarnate,

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:84%
it's now in another human body,
and still be around as a spirit?

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:90%
They're not as a spirit too.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:12.200 align:middle line:84%
We are fragments that come
from a collective conscious

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves that are
on the other side.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So once
it's gone, it's gone?

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: Once the spirit is
no longer embodied, it's gone.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But the spirit, when it's
embodied, it's in physical form

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:27.030 align:middle line:90%
and it's here.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.907 align:middle line:84%
But it's not both a
spirit and embodied.

00:25:30.907 --> 00:25:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't do
both at the same time?

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: No, you've got to
have either one or the other.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what I didn't think.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yeah.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:90%
What drives you?

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: What drives me?

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I really, really am
hoping to bring comfort

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.710 align:middle line:84%
to people with their
concerns about death.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:84%
There's such a
stigma of about it

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and such a finality
for most people that--

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:90%
and it's a fact of life.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really when we die, we
really begin living, really.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.950 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing over there
with all of the spirits

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and things like
that that are there

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.740 align:middle line:90%
to love us and cheer us on.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people,
Lynn, are so connected

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.750 align:middle line:84%
to their animals and
pets, they love them.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, like a
human, a pet will pass on.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Is it still around?

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: The spirit
is still around,

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.398 align:middle line:90%
but we do see our pets again.

00:26:21.398 --> 00:26:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
thing, too, with people.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:90%
We see them again.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
With the pets, they come
in more of a second part

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:90%
of the reception that you have.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.650 align:middle line:90%
They do come in.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, is
people need to understand

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.560 align:middle line:84%
is it's not just your
animals from this lifetime

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that you get to
have a reunion with,

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:84%
it is your pets from many
lifetimes on many planets.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So you might be surprised if you
have a white elephant or a camel

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.370 align:middle line:84%
running up to give
you a hug, and you're

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.560 align:middle line:84%
expecting a German shepherd,
because they're all

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:90%
coming to visit you.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been shocked by
anything on the other side?

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: Some of the
things-- well, for one thing,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:84%
seeing those spirits
that appeared

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.910 align:middle line:84%
to be from somewhere
else, that was very, very

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:90%
interesting to me.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And there are other things, too.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
elementals and things

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:84%
like that are in
spirit form that

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:84%
are a whole other
facet of spirituality.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:84%
But yes, but mostly
getting to see

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that there were some other
beings from somewhere else

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
there that was a
huge thing for me.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
God mean to you, Lynn?

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: I believe that
God is the overall creator

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it
the higher power.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:84%
There are different
names for God.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
There's Yahweh, there's Jehovah,
there's Buddha, there's Allah.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And they all basically pretty
much mean the same source.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that source work?

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Does it get things done?

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: It does.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.410 align:middle line:90%
However, it delegates.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are levels
of masters, and archangels,

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of things that
they work kind of filters

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.860 align:middle line:84%
down through, because there
are a lot of-- not only

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.830 align:middle line:84%
is it this galaxy and
universe, but there are so

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:84%
many others in addition to
ours here that, of course,

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:84%
he kind of has to delegate
things a little bit.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If those
commit suicide,

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:90%
what happens to their soul?

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: Suicide is
an interesting one.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Suicide is something that
is very much frowned upon,

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.743 align:middle line:84%
not only in the physical realm,
but also the spiritual realm.

00:28:27.743 --> 00:28:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And most
religions frown on it.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.327 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes, exactly.

00:28:30.327 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is that
suicide should never, ever,

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:84%
ever, ever, ever be an option
because of the rippling effect

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.220 align:middle line:90%
that it creates.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.943 align:middle line:84%
When we come here,
we have contracts.

00:28:44.943 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:84%
We choose our parents,
we choose our siblings,

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.310 align:middle line:84%
we choose our children,
and they choose us.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody exits early,
a lot of the people that

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
were counting on that
person-- even children wanting

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to come in, if the
person commits suicide,

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that child doesn't
get to be born in.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And who knows, they could
have been the doctor

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:90%
finding the cure for cancer.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.303 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: So it creates
that rippling effect.

00:29:07.303 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:84%
However, with suicide, it
is seen as a sudden death.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:84%
It is handled very differently
on this other side.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.890 align:middle line:90%
People do not go to hell.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And also, it depends on
the suicide and the reason

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:90%
for which it happens.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if a person has
had assisted suicide medically

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:84%
because they are
terminally ill and they're

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:84%
getting ready to pass anyway,
but they want to choose

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.670 align:middle line:90%
their own date, that's fine.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:84%
That is not looked
at as a suicide.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Also, people that are
severely suffering

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:84%
from mental illness, that is
also dealt with differently.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It's when somebody
commits suicide out

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:84%
of spite or selfish reasons
that it is very much

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:90%
frowned upon that way.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have some
friends who have died.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've always wondered
what they went through right

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:90%
before they died.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Did they know they were dying?

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Did they feel it?

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.850 align:middle line:84%
One died of COVID
with pneumonia.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Another had a stupid
drug overdose.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.368 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, do they
know they're dying?

00:30:11.368 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: Usually they do
know that they're dying,

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.105 align:middle line:84%
and then a peace
comes over them.

00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And if they're having
any pain or discomfort,

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:90%
it usually leaves instantly.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.170 align:middle line:90%
To die is not painful.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.360 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a relief
in a lot of ways.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
But they do, they start
seeing some of these things.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice sometimes
if they're coherent,

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:84%
they will talk about
seeing spirits in the room.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is common.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people leave and
start talking about them a year

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.760 align:middle line:90%
in advance.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've had patients that have
actually done that as well.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Even people that had
Alzheimer's would

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.760 align:middle line:84%
talk about angels, people
that hadn't spoken for years.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
At the time when people
have been crossing,

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:84%
they observed these
because they're

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:54.310 align:middle line:84%
in that window of also getting
ready to cross themselves.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:90%
But yes, they do.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.832 align:middle line:84%
They have a peace that comes
over them that they're ready.

00:31:02.832 --> 00:31:04.540 align:middle line:84%
There are three
different kinds of death.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a natural death, sudden
death, a near-death experience.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
handled differently.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have a
natural death, which

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.350 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like your
friends were more

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.600 align:middle line:84%
of a natural death in the
sense, including the person that

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:90%
overdosed because--

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
very untimely.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: OK.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:22.877 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:22.877 --> 00:31:24.460 align:middle line:84%
A sudden death would
be something more

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.160 align:middle line:84%
like an auto accident,
something more instantaneous

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.015 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't expected.

00:31:30.015 --> 00:31:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
many deaths aren't

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
expected, unless you're in bed
for six weeks or withering away.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: That's true.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.020 align:middle line:84%
But in reference to your
friends, I mean, we don't die.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.530 align:middle line:90%
We simply shed our skin and go.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.060 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.710 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a very
beautiful thing.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see
spirits every place you go?

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: No.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I can kind of turn it on and
turn it off, fortunately.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they sneak up on me.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.822 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are there any in here?

00:31:57.822 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: Yeah, actually, I did
see one walkthrough earlier,

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:84%
by the way, when I was
in there getting makeup,

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and also sitting in your lobby.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.042 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did it look like?

00:32:06.042 --> 00:32:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: Well, one
of them was a female.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.290 align:middle line:90%
It definitely was a female.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And the other one kind
of went by quickly.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of saw the tail end
of a shoe, kind of going by.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The ghost of Gaia.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: The ghost of Gaia.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, I wouldn't doubt it.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.222 align:middle line:84%
So many of us are empaths, and
our lights-- including yourself.

00:32:22.222 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing
this kind of thing,

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:84%
you are in that empathic
window, our lights

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.010 align:middle line:84%
are much brighter
because of our abilities.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.945 align:middle line:84%
And spirits are
drawn to us that way

00:32:32.945 --> 00:32:34.570 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes
they think that we're

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:37.240 align:middle line:84%
angels that can
help them cross over

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.537 align:middle line:84%
or they're just interested
in coming around the energy.

00:32:40.537 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lynn is there a heaven?

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Is there a hell?

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: There is
a heaven, and there

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.360 align:middle line:90%
is what would be called a hell.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have come back
with near-death experiences

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:54.805 align:middle line:84%
that have seen both, that
have talked about both.

00:32:54.805 --> 00:32:58.960 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Seeing people pass
away and seeing

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:84%
the loved ones come in
from coming somewhere

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and that they help
them transition over,

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and having patients
talking about heaven--

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I had a patient come
back, she was in what

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.520 align:middle line:90%
we call a rallying stage.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's where
they're transitioning

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and they're unconscious part
of the time and hard to rouse.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.958 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, they
come back for one more time,

00:33:22.958 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and they're talkative,
and their eyes are bright,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and their toes perk.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And she had come back,
and her niece, April,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:90%
was in the room with her.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.620 align:middle line:90%
And I'm assisting the patient.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And she says to her
niece, she said,

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.910 align:middle line:84%
when are you going to have
those little baby girls?

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to see those little baby
girls before I go home to Jesus.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And her niece,
April, turned to her

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:84%
and she said, well, I
can't have children.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:84%
She said, I've been trying
for 25 years to have children,

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.030 align:middle line:90%
and I'm 45 and I'm in menopause.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's a nice thought, but
that's not going to happen.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And the patient piped up
and she said, no, these

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:90%
are your two little girls.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.500 align:middle line:90%
You're holding one in each arm.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:09.710 align:middle line:84%
She said, they have blonde,
ringlet-type hair, chocolate

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:84%
brown eyes, dimples, and
they look just like you.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, April responded,
she said, I am 45 years old.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be able
to have any children.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:19.679 align:middle line:90%
That's a nice thought.

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why you're
seeing those little girls.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.600 align:middle line:90%
And the aunt passed away.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.213 align:middle line:84%
And about six months later,
April's uncle came through,

00:34:27.213 --> 00:34:28.380 align:middle line:90%
and her father came through.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.530 align:middle line:84%
At one point, one of
them had hip surgery.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And she was coming
in to see him.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.030 align:middle line:84%
He was having physical
therapy on the floor,

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.280 align:middle line:90%
and she has a baby bump.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And I see her, and
I walk up to her

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, what's
she got in there.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:45.469 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she had a
set of identical twin girls

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and that she was pregnant--
very early, pregnant right

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.580 align:middle line:84%
before her aunt crossed
over, but didn't know it.

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.719 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, because she
had other family members that

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.460 align:middle line:84%
were coming through
the facility,

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I got to see her
two other times.

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of those times those
little girls were toddlers.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And they did have blonde
curls, brown eyes, dimples,

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and they looked
just like the mom,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:90%
just like the aunt had said.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So they do come back
with beautiful messages,

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.010 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times, from
the other side of things

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:90%
that they've seen.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And they leave those
messages with people.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been
annoyed by the spirit world?

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yes.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I have.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I recently purchased--
well, I didn't

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:32.280 align:middle line:84%
purchase I inherited a house
from my sister, recently passed

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.080 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was over at the house,
thinking that there was

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:38.662 align:middle line:90%
a spirit problem in the house.

00:35:38.662 --> 00:35:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could feel that?

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yeah, you feel that.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was a man
and a woman in there.

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a couple of
paranormal groups come in,

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and they got the EVP readings
and got them on there.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.170 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, OK.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I just
need to bless the house.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And I use a fire
component when I go in

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.990 align:middle line:84%
so that whether they
want to leave or not,

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.270 align:middle line:84%
they're sucked into
the fire into the pan,

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.800 align:middle line:84%
into a sticky component
in the bottom.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So I went in, I
cleared the house,

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:09.530 align:middle line:90%
and the thing didn't leave.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.140 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in the house with my son.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:84%
We're standing upstairs, and all
of a sudden, I see this thing.

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like--

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I've never experienced anything
with an elemental before,

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.560 align:middle line:84%
but this thing
literally is about--

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.310 align:middle line:90%
just under 3 feet tall.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like the
banker on Hogwarts.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Looks just like in a--

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's walking past me, and
then he walks past my son.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And my son says, did you
just see Hogwarts walk by?

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.913 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, yeah, I saw him.

00:36:36.913 --> 00:36:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
surprised he did, too?

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: Yeah.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I didn't
think that you saw him.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And then he comes back out and
he walks past me again, back

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:90%
into the room.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And then he comes
out a third time.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.620 align:middle line:84%
The third time he comes out,
there is a wreath of faces

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.050 align:middle line:84%
that he kind of brought
with him that were spirits

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:56.870 align:middle line:84%
that he was anchoring there,
that he kind of brought along

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:90%
as balloons almost.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:84%
They were like his
little collection.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And there turned out to be
a rock that my sister had

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.500 align:middle line:84%
inadvertently carried into the
house that belonged to him,

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.180 align:middle line:90%
and he wanted it back.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up finding
that out and taking

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.140 align:middle line:90%
that out of the house.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:90%
And he's very happy now.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So he doesn't continue to
come in the house anymore.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is next for
you, Lynn, in your career?

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: I'm going to continue
to write another book.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be doing a
sequel to "Colors of Heaven."

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:30.700 align:middle line:84%
With seeing my sister pass
away not too long ago,

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I have learned that,
a lot of times, people

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
sometimes stay embodied
until the last minute,

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.480 align:middle line:90%
like my mother did.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are other people that
sometimes leave a day early

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.060 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even-- my sister
left 35 minutes before,

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and then they let their body
just go ahead and finish,

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:47.720 align:middle line:84%
but they've already
left and gone over.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.800 align:middle line:10%
And I would like to bring
this information to people

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:10%
and help them to have a better
understanding so that death

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.080 align:middle line:10%
isn't so scary.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And that they realize,
too, that it's

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:01.110 align:middle line:84%
not the last time that they're
going to see their loved ones.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:90%
They will see them again.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.310 align:middle line:10%
>>MONET: I am at
www.lynnmonet.com.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm getting ready to do
some webinar classes,

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:10%
and also some lectures
coming up here.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I've got one coming up in
South Africa and Japan.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spell your last name.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: It is M-O-N-E-T,
like the painter.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: My books are on Amazon,
they're on Barnes and Noble,

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:25.280 align:middle line:90%
they're everywhere.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.370 align:middle line:84%
However, if you purchase
them through my website,

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I will sign them for you
and customize them for you.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.600 align:middle line:90%
And they cost the same.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been pushed by a spirit?

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MONET: I have been
pushed by a spirit.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:90%
I have been hit by a spirit.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I've had my hair
pulled by a spirit.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.550 align:middle line:90%
I've been bitten by a spirit.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.780 align:middle line:84%
The spirits that were in
the house that I purchased,

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:84%
they were able to leave
claw marks that bleed.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.760 align:middle line:84%
They were able to leave
bite marks, bruises.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And definitely, they are able
to-- when people are afraid,

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:90%
they feed on that negativity.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And it enables them to
do more physical acts.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to push
people and do more things.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And really, with some of the
things such as SIDS, I mean,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.400 align:middle line:84%
it would be very possible
for a spirit like that

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:17.030 align:middle line:84%
to be able to suffocate a
newborn child with the force

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that they're able to push people
and pull hair, slam doors, all

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.330 align:middle line:90%
of that sort of thing.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you be careful
dealing with the other side.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MONET: They know me by name.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.570 align:middle line:84%
