>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:10%
Richard Martini, film
director-- he made a documentary

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:10%
about the afterlife
called "Flipside,"

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:10%
which has taken him on a path
to explore the afterlife.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:84%
A couple of his
latest books include

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:84%
"Architect of the Afterlife--
the Flipside Code"

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.305 align:middle line:84%

>>RICHARD MARITINI:
Thanks, George.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:90%
It's always great to see you.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great to
have you, my friend.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.857 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Sorry those
books are so big.

00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:54.525 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They are
heavy, paperweights.

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: They're also
good for working out.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the "Architect
of the Afterlife" all about?

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Well, architecture--
my father was an architect,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:10%
and so he taught me how
to read a blueprint.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:10%
It's one of those things--
you look at a piece of paper,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:10%
and then you point
to a building.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:84%
You say, well, that's what
that was before we started.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:10%
What you find in these cases
where I've been filming people

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:10%
under deep hypnosis, as
well as filming people

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:10%
not under hypnosis, talking
about the afterlife--

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.910 align:middle line:10%
and they say the same things,
the same kind of blueprints

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:10%
or plans that people
plan in their lifetimes,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:10%
choosing who they're going be.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these are people
who had after-death experience

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:90%
or what?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, in
the first six books,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I film people who were
under hypnosis generally.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Then I started filming people
who had near-death events.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Then I would ask them to
do a hypnosis session.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't asking the questions.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm just filming.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: The
hypnotherapist says what

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:90%
happened, blah, blah, blah.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about the
architecture or the structure

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife in such a way
that it's common hallmarks--

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
guides, teachers, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So I started seeing if I
could talk to people, just

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.270 align:middle line:84%
generally, and ask them, without
hypnosis, the same questions.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were giving
the exact same answers.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Talking to counsels--
people live on the air--

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I've done some radio shows.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I've done some
interviews with people

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:90%
on a blog cast with Dr. Drew.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:84%
He's a skeptic, doesn't
believe in the afterlife.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
let's just explore.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And in 15 minutes, you
can find it online.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
In 15 minutes, he's
talking to his counsel.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
At some point, I say,
can you see your guide?

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:90%
He's like, who's that?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, look around.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I
do see a person.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I say to the guide,
can you walk Dr. Drew in

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:90%
to visit with his counsel?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And Drew says to me,
what's my counsel?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I wasn't
talking to you.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking your guide.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, the
guide says it's OK.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.355 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
you know, he's

00:02:57.355 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
talking to a group, a
room full of people who

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:90%
are with all of-- each of us.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Each of us has our own group.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.428 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating
because no one's ever--

00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not aware of anybody
doing this before,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:90%
but I interview guide members.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I go up to each council
member and say, who are you?

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:84%
How did you earn a position
on this person's council?

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:84%
What do you represent in
their spiritual evolve?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they answer you?

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Courage.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:90%
One word-- they'll say courage.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
I represent the history
of all of his lifetimes.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I've had one say comedy.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people say-- they're
almost like the seven muses.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:84%
You've heard that Erato
and the muse of music.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Each one is different.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:90%
So I've never met--

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
but I have talked to council
members, and I ask them,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:90%
how many councils do you sit on?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And they'll tell
me, oh, I'm on 10.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll say I'm on thousands.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask,
well, why did you--

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and they apparently are
able to choose who they

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:90%
want to sit on their council.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:90%
So they pick.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:90%
That was the startling thing.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
That's in the
book, "Architecture

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.795 align:middle line:84%
of the Afterlife," where
one of the council members

00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:84%
said, well, I
decided that I wanted

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:90%
to sit on this guy's council.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've been sitting on all
these other councils doing

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was that he was--
the main thing that he did.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:84%
It might represent courage,
many lifetimes where

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
you were afraid to do the thing
that you always wanted to do.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And then he's there--
represents the person who

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:90%
helps you get to that goal.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So he'd been doing
that for other people.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he decided that this
guy who I was interviewing--

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and the person I'm talking to
has never read any of my books.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
anything about councils.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't know anything
about the afterlife.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:84%
But they're, without
any hypnosis,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:84%
looking into the
distance and saying--

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.550 align:middle line:90%
it's weird.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:90%
But I'm seeing a person--

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and I've also interviewed
people who normally

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:90%
incarnate in other realms.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't look like humans.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Some of them look like--

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and the class-- you've heard
all those classic alien-type

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Alien grays.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah, grays, lizards.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:90%
And so I ask them--

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I say, look, if
you've ever incarnated

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.845 align:middle line:90%
on the planet Earth--

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I had one guy say, I
wouldn't stoop so low.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So can you show our friend
here the place you're from.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, the person
I'm sitting with is saying,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing a terrain with two
moons, et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And I ask questions.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:90%
What's your government like?

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:90%
What's it like living there?

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, people mostly when they
have this experience talking

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.880 align:middle line:84%
to me-- they say afterwards, ah,
I feel like I made it all up.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.700 align:middle line:90%
Because it's weird.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they remember it?

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, they're
remembering something.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'm asking the
question, and they answer

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:90%
before they can remember.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And often when they're
speaking to me, they're saying,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:90%
this is--

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know why I'm
saying this, but I'm saying--

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just popping
out of their mouths.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.633 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Just popping
out of their mouths.

00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would think that
would be imagination, right?

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And you would think
that people would just--

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Vivid imagination.

00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Vivid imagination.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:84%
However, it's consistent
vivid imagination.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the
same hallmarks, you see?

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Libraries, councils,
people being

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:84%
able to choose their lifetimes,
people having soul groups

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that they normally
incarnate with,

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:90%
having teachers and guides.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So this architecture
of the flip side,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
let's say, for lack
of a better term--

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.125 align:middle line:84%
it's a way of examining
how consciousness works.

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really
what I'm talking about.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
How does consciousness work?

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:84%
People have been, for
years, trying to figure out

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:90%
what is conscious.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that may very
well be the afterlife.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, it
appears to be this.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:90%
So what they say is--

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm not going anywhere.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: What they say
is you bring about a third

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
of your conscious energy,
of George conscious energy,

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
to a lifetime, about a
third, roughly, 20% to 40%.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the average
out of the thousands

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.210 align:middle line:84%
of cases I've examined
and this 50 that I

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
filmed of hypnosis
cases, and this other 50.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So people say somewhere about a
third of their conscious energy

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:90%
they bring to a lifetime.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.640 align:middle line:90%
The other 2/3 always stays home.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:90%
That's the term they use.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:20.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: You mean
why does it stay home?

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:22.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:24.613 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: They say
because it would blow

00:07:24.613 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:90%
the circuits of the human body.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just too much information.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what they say.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So they bring about a
third, let's say, roughly.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And some people bring more.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Some people bring less.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:84%
The avatars that we've
known in human history

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:90%
appear to have brought more.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
People that are
famous for miracles

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
or handling things or
doing stuff or changing

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
people's lives when
they walk up to them--

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
those people may have
brought more energy.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I asked one of those
avatars in a session--

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:84%
it's in "Backstage Pass,"
and it's an "Architecture

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:90%
of the Afterlife."

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I said, so why is it you had
this profound effect on people

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:90%
whenever they saw you?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's because
I brought more of source

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:90%
with me in this lifetime.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he
brought more percentage

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:90%
of his conscious energy.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of
conscious energy

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
as source, whatever
that is, then you're

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
talking about-- it's
almost like if you

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:90%
think of the ocean as source.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Then we bring a
pint of who we are.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Then two other
pints are back home.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
And while we're
here, we experience

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:90%
the things we experience.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
And when our life
is done, that pint

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.400 align:middle line:84%
evaporates and goes
back home and re-blends

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:90%
with the other 2/3.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And now we consciously
recall all of our lifetimes,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:90%
why we chose this lifetime.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:84%
However, you can
measure people who've

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of an event,
conscious altered experience--

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
near-death experience, LSD,
out-of-body, under hypnosis

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:90%
or even guided meditation.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.540 align:middle line:84%
People appear to be
shifting the filters that

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:90%
block this information.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, while
they're under hypnosis

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle line:84%
or in a guided meditation
or in a near-death event,

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
they're back home, looking
around, saying, wow,

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling unconditional love.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Wait a second.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Here comes my uncle, and he's
telling me I gotta go back.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go back.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:90%
This is common.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Or sometimes they do.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And
sometimes they do.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that
once we're back here,

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
we're back to being this
filtered person that we are.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, filters are interesting
in a science level

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:84%
because if you look
at Dr. Grayson, who's

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:90%
just retired from UVA--

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
he's the preeminent scientist
on near-death experiences--

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:84%
he has a talk on YouTube
called "Is Consciousness

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Produced By the Brain?"

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:84%
In it, he talks about
all the medical cases

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:84%
where people's brains were
not functioning in life--

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:90%
encephalitis, other reasons.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:90%
But they still functioned.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he points out that
in the UK, 70% of the dementia

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:84%
patients, just prior
to dying, they suddenly

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:84%
recall their life's memories
as if the filters have died.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had been taken off.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Because they
do the autopsy afterwards,

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and the post-mortem shows
that the brains had atrophied.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
So as he pointed out, it's
as if the filters died.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And now I tie that into Dr.
Helen Wambach's works, somebody

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:90%
that I've studied a little bit--

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:84%
1970s-- she was a
clinical psychologist who

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:84%
did the same kind
of hypnosis thing

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
that Michael Newton had
done, but she did it

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
10 years earlier,
2,000 cases where

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
she had group sessions
where people could remember

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
previous lifetimes that she
was able to forensically

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
historically find
to be accurate.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people remember
their Akashic records?

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And what are these records?

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, it
appears, Akashic just

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:84%
means invisible in Sanskrit,
but it's this library.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And we all apparently--
like having a council,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:90%
we all have our own library.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not like a--

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:84%
if you think of it that way,
our perspective of the library--

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.680 align:middle line:84%
so I've talked to people who've
seen, in their library, books.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I've seen scrolls.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.735 align:middle line:84%
I've had them talk about
lights, physical lights.

00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked them
to look into the light,

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, oh,
it's all my lifetimes.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
had a chance to talk

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:84%
to investigator Roberta Grimes
about the Hall of Records.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.350 align:middle line:10%
What about the Hall of Records?

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:10%
What about our life reading
that they say is in the book?

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERTA GRIMES: Well, here's--

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:10%
we do a life review.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:10%
And has as Brendan
pointed out, there's

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.628 align:middle line:10%
a limited life review, often.

00:11:45.628 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:10%
Or I can't remember who did it.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it was Evan.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:10%
So we do all of that, and
we get to see this lifetime.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:10%
But many of us are curious
about prior lifetimes.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:10%
Now, in our mind,
when we first rejoin

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:10%
it are the memories of
our major lifetimes.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.985 align:middle line:10%
We already know-- oh, yes, I
was Julius Caesar or whatever.

00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:10%
We already know that stuff.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:10%
But we're interested in the
less important lifetime.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:10%
So there is a way
to review them.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:10%
And we think what happens is
you go to this big library,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:10%
and you basically revisit--

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.958 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: With your
loved ones, maybe?

00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GRIMES: Or by yourself.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people do
this by themselves.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.283 align:middle line:10%
And you revisit the life review
hologram for that lifetime.

00:12:25.283 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:10%
And basically,
you're in it again.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:10%
You can research almost anything
in those halls of records.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
change your records?

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.103 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: That's
absolutely right.

00:12:35.103 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Can you change your records?

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once it's
there, it's there.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But I've
interviewed librarians.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So in the work I'm
doing, what she's

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:90%
talking about is accurate.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
You cannot not only investigate
your own journey but, you can

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
ask librarians to show you
other people's journeys.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Afterlife librarians.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Afterlife librarians.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And in "Architecture
of the Afterlife"

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:84%
there's an interview
with one who

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:90%
claims to be "the" librarian.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And I ask him a lot of
questions about that.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it God?

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
as he put it, God

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
is this term that
humans need to use

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
so they can get a
better handle on it.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you think
of God as an experience,

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:90%
you're closer to the truth.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
He said, God is beyond the
capacity of the human brain

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.110 align:middle line:90%
to comprehend.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not physically possible.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: He said, but
you can experience God

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:84%
by opening your heart to
everyone and all things.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've gone back to visit
this guy via different people,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:90%
as weird as that sounds.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Somebody in Connecticut--
I'm doing a session on Skype,

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.265 align:middle line:90%
and her guide, Trixie--

00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:90%
I remember her name--

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trixie?

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Trixie was
the guide, and she

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:84%
described a 7-foot-tall
woman who was like an Amazon.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, are we
done with the session?

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:90%
She said, no.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Trixie wants to you
to meet somebody.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And we went into
her Akashic library,

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and we start
interviewing this guy.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And I say, are you
familiar with my work?

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:90%
I always ask that question.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:84%
The guy, the librarian,
says, oh, yeah.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.205 align:middle line:84%
We met in another session
you did four years ago.

00:14:05.205 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For somebody else.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And he describes
what we talked about,

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.565 align:middle line:90%
this God concept.

00:14:10.565 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm talking to somebody
I've never met before.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:middle line:90%
She hasn't read any of my books.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But she's accessing a
guy on the flip side

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.327 align:middle line:84%
who is reminding me of something
that we conversed about.

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You remembered it then?

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Well, like then.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, my gosh.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to somebody
on the flip side

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.608 align:middle line:84%
who recalls a conversation that
we had two or three years ago.

00:14:30.608 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting--
what he has to say

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.650 align:middle line:84%
is that you can examine
these Akashic records to see

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:90%
why you chose that lifetime.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:84%
That's key-- why you
chose this lifetime

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.900 align:middle line:90%
and what the two have in common.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Because there's a theme.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
believer in reincarnation?

00:14:50.145 --> 00:14:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Oh, I try to drop the
word "belief" because I've had

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:90%
so many cases I've examined.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Tucker at UBA has 1,500
cases currently under review.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:90%
I've examined them.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Ian Stevenson was a scientist
who dealt with reincarnation.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Reincarnation is a thing.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.010 align:middle line:90%
We all reincarnate.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:84%
This research shows
that the 2/3 that stays

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:90%
home, the 1/3 that comes here--

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:84%
the process of incarnation
is going from spirit realm

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:84%
to being, and that's
why there are no aliens.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.693 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, our dear
friend Raymond Moody loves

00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:90%
talking about reincarnation.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.987 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Oh.

00:15:28.987 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:10%
>>RAYMOND MOODY: In
the United States,

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:10%
there's this myth that
ideas about reincarnation

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:10%
first came into the West through
India back in the 19th century.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:10%
But that's just simply not
correct because reincarnation

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:10%
was present as an idea
at the very beginning

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.570 align:middle line:10%
of Western civilization.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:10%
And Pythagoras, for example,
who was the person who

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:10%
coined the term "philosophy,"
was a reincarnationist,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:10%
and he claimed to remember
eight of his past lives

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:10%
and had some
technique that he was

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:10%
able to get his students to
have that experience as well.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:10%
And as part of their
Pythagorean training,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:10%
when they woke up
in the morning,

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:10%
before they got out
of bed, they would

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:10%
have to retrace their
steps of the day

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:10%
before, go through the
entire day, step by step,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:10%
before they got out of bed.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:10%
And then if they
mastered that, then they

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:10%
would have to go back one
day further than that,

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:10%
the day before.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:10%
And the reason for
the training is

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:10%
they felt that if they
could so exquisitely train

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:10%
their memories,
then when they got

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:10%
into the situation of
choosing their next life,

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:10%
they would remember what they
had picked up in this life

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:10%
to be able to augment it.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:10%
So, you see, reincarnation
was there at the beginning.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:10%
Plato was a reincarnationist
and had some very brilliant

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:10%
perceptions, I think, about
the reincarnation process,

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:10%
one of them being that he
made an articulate statement

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.380 align:middle line:10%
about why we don't
remember our past lives.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:10%
And what he did was
he formulated it

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:10%
in terms of an experience
that every one of us has had.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:10%
And it's called in
psychology an event boundary.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:10%
What an event boundary
is is an event boundary

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:10%
has to do with the fact
that the mind puts things

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:10%
into little packets for process.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:10%
And when you get
out of that packet,

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:10%
you may not have access
to that information.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:10%
And the most common example is
that you're in the living room,

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:10%
and you think of something you
want to get in the kitchen.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:10%
So what happens as you
go through the doorway

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:10%
into the kitchen--

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.290 align:middle line:10%
you forget what you
came in there for.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:10%
And that's an event boundary.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:10%
And Plato articulated
how that is

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:10%
involved in the
reincarnation experience.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rich,
what's reincarnation?

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Do we choose who
we're going back to?

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: According to
this research and my own

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I've had six of these sessions,
just like Pythagoras--

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:90%
I've been able to recall--

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
because once I'm
in this session,

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to access the
memory of that lifetime.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I do the forensic
historical research

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:90%
to see how accurate it could be.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I
couldn't believe it.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.150 align:middle line:84%
But then when I
found a historian who

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:84%
confirmed everything that
I remembered about my life

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
as a Lakota Sioux Indian,
then I was able to allow that.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, what I'm doing in
"Architecture of the Afterlife"

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:84%
is the Pythagorean
method, which is

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to ask your students to open up
their minds to remember things

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:90%
without judging whatever it is.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But, I mean, are
we picking our next life?

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Well, yes.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we
go-- here's the thing.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So the one third that's
here-- when it returns home

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
to the other two thirds,
it remembers, oh, this

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:90%
is why I chose that lifetime.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:84%
This is why I
chose these events.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:84%
These are all the things
that happened to me.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.590 align:middle line:90%
And then you get together.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.990 align:middle line:84%
No lifetime is
planned by yourself.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.700 align:middle line:90%
All of your guides help.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
All of the people
in your lifetime--

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kind of this council?

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, not only your
council, yes, but your parents.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:84%
They have to agree
to be your parents.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Your friends have to agree.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean
the new parents?

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.945 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: The new parents.

00:19:23.945 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And so you're there in the flip
side, outside of time, roughly,

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:90%
and you're talking.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've filmed many of
these life planning sessions

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
where you're with your
parents or whoever

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.200 align:middle line:90%
it is, your children.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
be your children.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:90%
And they all volunteer.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
They raise their hand,
or they say, you know,

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll come
along, and I'll

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.757 align:middle line:84%
be your spouse for
a couple of years.

00:19:46.757 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But then we're going to break
up because I have to learn this.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:90%
But you'll learn this from me.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.337 align:middle line:84%
It's planned like
an architecture.

00:19:53.337 --> 00:19:54.545 align:middle line:90%
It's planned in great detail.

00:19:54.545 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all designed.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It's all designed,
but we have free will,

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:90%
so we can always screw it up.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:01.430 align:middle line:90%
And we do.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are
the council members?

00:20:03.025 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
council members,

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.570 align:middle line:84%
generally, Michael Newton first
introduced me to the concept,

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
but they're generally
from 6 to 12 individuals.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Some people have more.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.278 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who have died.

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, some
of them aren't even--

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.170 align:middle line:90%
they've never incarnated.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are people
from other realms.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:10%
In an interview I did with
Edgar Cayce in "Hacking

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:10%
the Afterlife," he claimed that
the reason he was so accurate

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:10%
about his health stuff that
he would learn under trance is

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:10%
because he had a council of
doctors from other realms who

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.162 align:middle line:10%
had never-- because
I asked them--

00:20:33.162 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:10%
I did an interview with them.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.328 align:middle line:84%
I said, have you ever
incarnated on the planet?

00:20:36.328 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:90%
They said no.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they're aware
of how health works

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.430 align:middle line:84%
or how medicine
works in their realm,

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:84%
they were able to advise
Edgar in this realm.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.732 align:middle line:84%
I know that sounds crazy,
but all I can tell you is--

00:20:48.732 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Coming from you, no.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But some
council members--

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I had one guy, a very
successful television writer,

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:90%
saw his father on his council.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:90%
So that was unusual.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I interviewed the father,
and I said, why are you here?

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.812 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I
earned this place.

00:21:03.812 --> 00:21:06.020 align:middle line:84%
After my very difficult
lifetime that I went through,

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I earned my place, and I wanted
to keep an eye on my son.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody in
the council is--

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're not all--

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
in one case, they didn't
want to talk to me.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the middle of doing
a conversation with them,

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, they
all disappeared.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And the lea counselor
said, we don't think

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing is right.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't think
this person needs--

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.982 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they toss you out?

00:21:24.982 --> 00:21:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: They tossed me
out, literally 86'ed me out

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:90%
of the council.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't go lightly.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I know you.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So I-- well, I asked
about six or seven questions

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:90%
before they left to clarify.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Why are you doing this, or
why are you kicking me out?

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And then it turned
out this person

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:84%
that I was with doing the
thing with didn't want--

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't know these things.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:84%
She had to learn
them on her own.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.995 align:middle line:84%
So you can't disrupt
a person's journey.

00:21:50.995 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's what
you would have done.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: You know, I
want the lottery numbers.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.460 align:middle line:90%
I always ask.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:90%
They never give them to me.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Usually they laugh.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is, you can't
disrupt a person's life.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to allow people to
be who they're going to be.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This book, "Backstage
Pass to the Flipside

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:90%
3," what's this all about?

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So that is a
continuation of the first two

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
books that I did with Jennifer
Schaffer, a medium who

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:84%
works with law enforcement
in missing person cases.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:84%
She works with the Colorado
Bureau of Investigation

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:90%
and other people.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So she's very good
at what she does.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And I realized after we
met and did an interview

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:84%
with Amelia Earhart that
she was like a cell phone

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:90%
to the flip side.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And so since then,
I've started asking

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:90%
friends who passed away--

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Bill Paxton-- there's
a movie on Gaia

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:84%
called "Talking
to Bill Paxton--"

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer and two other mediums
help me talk to my old friend.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had them ask
him the same 20

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:84%
questions to see if the
questions would change.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:84%
But Billy just said the
same things to each one.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He died
of heart issues.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.063 align:middle line:84%
He had a routine operation he
was supposed to go through.

00:23:00.063 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he went into a coma
or something and never woke up.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And so Billy-- I asked him,
what who was there to greet you

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:90%
through all three mediums?

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:84%
They said John,
some guy named John.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It was his father.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
was that a surprise?

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, because
then I realized I was dead.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, what do you
want me to tell your family,

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
which I did, very
profound things

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
that I privately
sent them messages.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But he said, what do you
want me to tell your fans?

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.537 align:middle line:84%
And he said, tell
them I can fly.

00:23:29.537 --> 00:23:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what does that mean?

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:34.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, you can move over
here at the speed of thought,

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.248 align:middle line:90%
that you can zip anywhere.

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's right about that.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And then you can
also construct the architecture

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:90%
where you want to be.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And he liked being on
white, sandy beaches.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, I
create this sandy beach.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I do the math, the mental
construct, and I'm there.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle line:90%
And I can hang out there.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:84%
My friends can
come and visit me.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:90%
We talked to Junior Seau.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.480 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
we have a little clip

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:90%
of you talking to him.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.952 align:middle line:84%
He's a former football
player who took his own life.

00:24:03.952 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Took his own life.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.922 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know we were
going to talk about Junior.

00:24:07.922 --> 00:24:09.338 align:middle line:84%
>>TERRY MORGAN: I
want to turn now

00:24:09.338 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
to the alarming discovery
providing some answers

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:84%
to the questions surrounding
the suicide of NFL great

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:90%
and father of four, Junior Seau.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:10%
Today, a team of
doctors confirmed

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:10%
that he suffered from
degenerative brain

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:10%
disease which could be
linked to the years he

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:10%
spent taking blows and giving
them on the football field.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:10%
Tonight, Seau's
family is speaking out

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:10%
for the first time about
this discovery in an ABC News

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:10%
and ESPN exclusive.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.186 align:middle line:10%
Here's ABC's Jim Avila.

00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM AVILA: For 20 years, he
was a warrior on the field--

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:10%
Junior Seau, the monster in
the middle, a defensive icon

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:10%
whose devastating hits--

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:10%
more than 1,850
tackles in his career--

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:10%
knocked out opponents.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:10%
But after his sudden
and shocking suicide

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:10%
just eight months ago,
a gunshot to the chest,

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:10%
some speculating
he knew his brain

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.190 align:middle line:10%
needed to be preserved
for examination.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.390 align:middle line:10%
And many agree that all those
hits in the 43-year-old's head

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:10%
could have played a
role in his own death.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:10%
>> He just toughed
everything out.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:10%
>>AVILA: And now,
Seau's family says

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:10%
they did play a central role.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:10%
Did he know that he was
getting concussions?

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:10%
>>GINA SEAU: Oh, sure, he did.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.178 align:middle line:10%
>>AVILA: And the
family has results

00:25:21.178 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:10%
from a study on Seau's brain
at the National Institutes

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:10%
of Health to back them up.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:10%
ABC News and ESPN have
learned exclusively

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:10%
that Seau's brain showed signs
of CTE, Chronic Traumatic

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.960 align:middle line:10%
Encephalopathy, the
concussion-related injury that

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:10%
is at the center of today's
football safety controversy.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.918 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Russell Lonser
conducted the study.

00:25:43.918 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:10%
>>RUSSELL LONSER: What was
found in Junior Seau's brain

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.430 align:middle line:10%
with cellular changes
consistent with CTE.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAU: It means that he had a
lot of head-to-head collisions

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:10%
over the course of 20 years
of playing in the NFL.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:10%
>>AVILA: The actual cells
in his brain, you now know,

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.050 align:middle line:10%
suffered damage.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAU: Exactly.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you get
that kind of information

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.980 align:middle line:90%
when you dealt with Junior Seau?

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Junior--
I'm going to skip down

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:90%
because there's a lot to it.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But Junior came through
specifically to Jennifer

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to let us know
that Joe Nameth has

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:84%
cured CTE using hyperbaric
oxygen therapy, his own CTE.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And the way that came about was
I have I heard about his wife.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen his wife
on television, Gina.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
massive oxygen breathing.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, yeah, it's a
specific thing for head injury.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
pressurized rod, yeah.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And you do
it for like 40 sessions.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.775 align:middle line:84%
But Joe Namath, they
came through to tell me--

00:26:40.775 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's still alive.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.108 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Who's still alive.

00:26:43.108 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So Dave Duerson, who
was the first football

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
player who shot himself-- and
he was the one whose brain they

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.990 align:middle line:84%
used at Boston University--
and Junior Seau

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:84%
both came through in
a session to tell us,

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:59.240 align:middle line:84%
specifically, you can
cure CTE using this method

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:90%
that Joe Namath has perfected.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I brought in Junior's
wife to a session

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:84%
without telling
Jennifer who she was.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:84%
In that session, she
talks to her husband

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.805 align:middle line:90%
in a very dramatic way.

00:27:12.805 --> 00:27:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of the session,

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer then remembered
where we had met Junior.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was she emotional?

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Very
emotional, of course,

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't get
a chance to say goodbye

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:90%
and to understand what happened.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to
explain it to her.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So what made it so
unusual is that we

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:84%
were doing a session initially
with Paul Allen, the Microsoft

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.270 align:middle line:90%
founder.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's who I was
trying to talk to.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And while we were there having
a conversation with him--

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he died
of natural causes.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: That's right.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.840 align:middle line:84%
But he confirmed some things
with a friend of mine,

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Julian Lennon,
John's son, so that I

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.190 align:middle line:84%
was able to confirm that
this was actually Paul,

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
because only private
things that they knew.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.853 align:middle line:84%
So I said to Paul, who
was there to greet you

00:27:52.853 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:90%
when you crossed over?

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And Jennifer said, these
two football players--

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:84%
22, 55--D Junior
Seau, Dave Duerson.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you guys
know each other?

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.990 align:middle line:84%
She said, they've come
forward because they

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
wanted to thank him for his
studies in brain trauma.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And so they were thanking--
and from that point,

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:84%
then they said they were trying
to tell us over three sessions

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
focus on Joe Namath.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Joe Namath has cured CTE.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.900 align:middle line:84%
His clinic in Jupiter,
fluoride can do it.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:84%
They're not focusing on
it because they shut down

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:84%
his clinic once people said he
was doing this kind of study.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you say cure,
they come and get you.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I know.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.720 align:middle line:84%
You know that
better than anybody.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But how else can I say that
Joe watched this footage.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:90%
So I put it on YouTube.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.530 align:middle line:84%
The film is called "Talking
to Paul Allen, Junior Seau

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.700 align:middle line:90%
and Dave Duerson."

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Dave Duerson had private
messages for his son

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.738 align:middle line:90%
which I passed along to his son.

00:28:49.738 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tracked him privately.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Privately.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't include-- and
there's footage with Gina.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't include
the private stuff.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But the important
stuff is life goes on.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Paul Allen still exists.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Junior Seau still exists even
though he committed suicide.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Dave Duerson still exists,
and Joe Namath has cured CTE.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.833 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to put
it any other way than--

00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:16.500 align:middle line:84%
like, they should pay
attention to them.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does Joe
know he's done this?

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: No.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Joe has gone on a number of
shows talking about how he

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.270 align:middle line:90%
felt like he had cured his CTE.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the way put it.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Late-night talk shows,
and it was recently.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Any people just ignored it.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:32.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It went right
over their heads.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.027 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Right
over their heads.

00:29:35.027 --> 00:29:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you look up
CTE and Joe Namath,

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:84%
you'll see a couple
of articles in Florida

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.410 align:middle line:84%
in Jupiter saying Joe thinks
he's cured CTE, or he had it.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would this
also work with PTSD?

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I mean,
I'm not a doctor.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.997 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is it
should be studied.

00:29:49.997 --> 00:29:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if you want to
communicate with your loved

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:56.740 align:middle line:84%
ones on the other side without
finding Richard Martini, how

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:57.880 align:middle line:90%
can people do this?

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I got this from
somebody through Jennifer.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:90%
And that is, say their name.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Start out by saying
your loved one's name.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Take out a photograph, some
memory that you have of them.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Focus on them.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Ask them questions.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.932 align:middle line:90%
Don't judge the answers.

00:30:15.932 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:90%
So you said their name.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:84%
You imagine them
sitting in front of you.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Ask them simple questions.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Is this you?

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:84%
If you can't hear something,
let them nod, shake their head,

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.400 align:middle line:90%
or shrug.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you're
going to ask a question

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:84%
that they answer before
you can ask the question.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:84%
That's when you know you're
connected to a loved one.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I tell people to ask questions
you don't know the answer to.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Who was there to greet
you when you crossed over?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.710 align:middle line:90%
What's your favorite food?

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.200 align:middle line:84%
What's the thing you
miss the most about life?

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get an
image in your mind.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
But when you hear an
answer or get the image

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:84%
before you can ask the
question, then you'll

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:53.620 align:middle line:90%
know you've made a connection.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you've talked a
lot about the medium Jennifer

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Schaffer.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She had an opportunity
to contact Project Blue Book's

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.387 align:middle line:90%
late Dr. J. Allen Hynek.

00:31:02.387 --> 00:31:04.365 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: That's true.

00:31:04.365 --> 00:31:07.623 align:middle line:84%
My question, sir-- who
was there to greet you

00:31:07.623 --> 00:31:08.540 align:middle line:90%
when you crossed over?

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:14.312 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.312 --> 00:31:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JENNIFER SCHAFFER:
I feel his father.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: His father.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Which leads me to
the next question.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:84%
At what point did
you become aware

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:84%
of other entities or
people who normally

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.000 align:middle line:90%
incarnate on other planets?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHAFFER: Because--
well, right away.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:90%
That was his life's purpose.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So right away, he had
a commune with people

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.940 align:middle line:90%
that we're not from here.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: If you
could, Professor,

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.870 align:middle line:84%
describe what they looked
like to you over there.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.015 align:middle line:84%
Were they light, or did they
have physical characteristics?

00:31:54.015 --> 00:31:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Or what did they look like?

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:04.593 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHAFFER: They were
not Martian-looking.

00:32:04.593 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Whatever that is.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.340 align:middle line:90%


00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.542 align:middle line:90%
Three fingers, big eyes.

00:32:09.542 --> 00:32:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHAFFER: You know,
the big eyes, yeah.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.680 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:84%
They were very tall in stature,
like with their lights.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: OK.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.302 align:middle line:90%
And big eyes or little eyes?

00:32:21.302 --> 00:32:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHAFFER: Different colors.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't-- it
looks like energy.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.572 align:middle line:84%
it's like energy that
has all the different--

00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:31.290 align:middle line:90%


00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Characteristics.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHAFFER: Yeah.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.558 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting because I
got shown a bunch of pictures.

00:32:37.558 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Well, give us a few.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.628 align:middle line:90%


00:32:42.628 --> 00:32:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHAFFER: He showed me what
they look like to humans,

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:90%
what they look like now.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: OK.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Which would be what?

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHAFFER: Like at that time.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Kind with big
eyes, gray skin, tall, skinny?

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:57.370 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:59.190 align:middle line:90%
We've talked to a few of them.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHAFFER: Yeah.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And so
let me ask you,

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
when did you become aware
that these so-called--

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHAFFER: The
reason why they were

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:14.040 align:middle line:84%
gray is because it was more
like a hazmat outfit for them.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: OK, so they're
wearing that so they

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.890 align:middle line:90%
can interact with humans.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHAFFER: Yeah,
because of our pollution.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: OK.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHAFFER: I know it
sounds weird, at the time,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.040 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Is that
what awareness was?

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SCHAFFER: Yeah.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Their awareness is they didn't
want to catch anything from us.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I see.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, are we
talking about beings

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that are in our same
frame, are they slightly

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:84%
in a different time frame
or frequency or realm?

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SCHAFFER: Way different
frequency and realm.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm fascinated with
the life of Dr. J. Allen Hynek.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I know his son, Paul.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.667 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: No kidding.

00:33:51.667 --> 00:33:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
an amazing guy.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, the reason that
I brought him to this session

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:84%
is because I was reading
something about him,

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and I remembered that when
I was in seventh grade,

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:06.890 align:middle line:84%
my teacher had introduced
him to me, brought him over

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.910 align:middle line:90%
to my house.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.227 align:middle line:90%
I was doing a science project.

00:34:09.227 --> 00:34:10.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The real
J. Allen Hynek.

00:34:10.602 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: The real J, yeah,
he was at Northwestern.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I
remember he smoked a pipe,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.955 align:middle line:84%
and he really looked
very professorial.

00:34:17.955 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was weird.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I was 14 years old, and I'm
meeting this great professor.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who he is.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.304 align:middle line:84%
But this teacher,
who's a scientist,

00:34:26.304 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
has brought us
together because--

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was she with Project
Blue Book at that time?

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It was just
prior to, I think.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:33.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:34.639 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What year?

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.435 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: '67.

00:34:36.435 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So it might have been
right around that time.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pretty close.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So here I am, and now
in my conscious mind,

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm remembering, oh, my
gosh, I met that guy.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, it's
easier to communicate

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.800 align:middle line:90%
with people you've met.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So I brought his
name to Jennifer.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.489 align:middle line:90%
She's never heard of him.

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:55.070 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't know
anything about J.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She has
no idea who he is.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Nothing.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.116 align:middle line:84%
And so she didn't know I
was going to ask about him.

00:34:58.116 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:90%
And you're seeing it live.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is kind of what I
do, which is-- and I'm sorry--

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I blink a lot, a
lot of blinking.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it's
just us exploring,

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.322 align:middle line:90%
seeing what's going on.

00:35:09.322 --> 00:35:10.530 align:middle line:90%
And of course, I was curious.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I knew enough about his life to
know that aliens were in them.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's say aliens.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And so in terms of the research,
what I hear consistently

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:24.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we're all light
beings that incarnate, right?

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.590 align:middle line:90%
So we come here to the planet.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.590 align:middle line:90%
We assumed this form.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:31.980 align:middle line:84%
We can also assume
form in other planets.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.230 align:middle line:84%
One third of all the
Michael Newton cases

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.883 align:middle line:84%
claim that they had
off-world lifetimes, memories

00:35:36.883 --> 00:35:37.800 align:middle line:90%
of previous lifetimes.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, and
that's conceivable.

00:35:39.425 --> 00:35:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So if
that's the case,

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:84%
then we're all aliens, if you
want to look at it that way.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And once we open up our
consciousness to that idea,

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.100 align:middle line:84%
that somebody who
looks completely weird,

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.440 align:middle line:84%
that has that kind
of strange thing--

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.360 align:middle line:90%
and if we can communicate--

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:90%
and it may not be this way.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:84%
It may be just thoughts
and pictures and images.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.228 align:middle line:84%
And once we get
used to that idea,

00:36:02.228 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:90%
then we're going to be visited.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not a
medium, though, are you?

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: No.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm a rare, medium rare.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many medium
rares have you dealt with?

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I've worked
with quite a few.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.390 align:middle line:84%
No, I've discovered-- because
mediums will say to me, where'd

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:17.260 align:middle line:90%
you get that idea?

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.030 align:middle line:90%
And I go, I don't know.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:90%
It popped into my head.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well,
that's what I do.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.220 align:middle line:90%
You're doing exactly what I do.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's really just opening
yourself up to the possibility.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
Kimberly Babcock.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Raylene Nuñez.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:84%
They're also in "Architecture
of the Afterlife"

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.100 align:middle line:90%
because Tony Stockwell--

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.472 align:middle line:90%
I interview them.

00:36:34.472 --> 00:36:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Johns Edwards, ever?

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I have not
worked with John Edwards,

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.410 align:middle line:90%
but I know somebody who--

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or Van Praagh?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: James Van Praagh-- it
was incidental in this research

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:84%
because when I was working
on the "Charles Grodin Show,"

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I brought him on the show,
and then we did an experiment

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:90%
without him knowing it.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Charles Grodin and I had this
mutual friend, Luana Anders,

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:53.260 align:middle line:90%
who had passed away.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.500 align:middle line:84%
She's our principal person
who helps us, Jennifer and I,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.180 align:middle line:90%
in our work.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:90%
But Luana passed away in 1996.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And right after she died,
I invited Van Praagh

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:84%
onto the show, and
he connected to her.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.570 align:middle line:90%
And I put it up on my website.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's the
moment when he said,

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:84%
she's saying there's a
photograph on your refrigerator

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.190 align:middle line:84%
that's the essence
of your relationship.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I only spoke about one
photograph a lot in my life,

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and it was a picture
of me and Luana in Rome

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.530 align:middle line:84%
together having
cappuccinos and laughing.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And when he said that, I knew
that only one person knew that,

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:90%
that I had said that aloud.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And she must therefore
still exist in some fashion.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So since '96, '97, that's
been my search for her.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.540 align:middle line:90%
How does she communicate?

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And then when I met
Jennifer, I realized, wow,

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.500 align:middle line:84%
it's like having a
Dixie cup with a string

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.360 align:middle line:90%
right over to their side.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:90%
And I could ask Luana, help us.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason it's
called "Backstage Pass"

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.885 align:middle line:84%
is because Tom Petty came
through when Jennifer

00:37:58.885 --> 00:38:00.010 align:middle line:90%
and I were doing a session.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
know Tom Petty.

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Why is he here?

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:06.970 align:middle line:84%
She said, he's saying that
there's a line of people trying

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
to talk to you, and that
Luana has a clipboard,

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.840 align:middle line:90%
and she weeds out who shouldn't.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.915 align:middle line:84%
So she's like the person
with the backstage passes.

00:38:16.915 --> 00:38:18.790 align:middle line:84%
She's the one who allows
them to get through.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's the one letting
them in, letting them out.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.165 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: She's
letting them in.

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:23.110 align:middle line:84%
They get the VIP thing,
and they sit down.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And now when Jennifer and
I do a session, she goes,

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Prince is here.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And I go, hang on.

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Luana, is he allowed in?

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.958 align:middle line:84%
And then Luana will say through
Jennifer, he jumped the line.

00:38:32.958 --> 00:38:34.000 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to do?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have a Prince guitar.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: You do?

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:37.428 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Next time
you talk to him,

00:38:37.428 --> 00:38:38.830 align:middle line:90%
I need him to sign it for me.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: OK, wait a minute.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Where'd you get it?

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I got--

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Or do you
want me to find out him?

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got it
from my credits

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:90%
at an auction for Verizon.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:51.040 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago,
they would sell stuff.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you have enough
credits, you could buy it.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: You
probably don't remember

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:84%
I asked you if
you wanted to talk

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:59.710 align:middle line:84%
to anybody on the flip side and
we talked about Don Rickles.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:00.877 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:00.877 --> 00:39:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, remember that story.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.760 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Well, just recently--

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:84%
so I talked to Don
Rickles after we talked.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed him.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, have you
ever met George?

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.510 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I met him briefly
backstage at Vegas.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:15.080 align:middle line:90%
That's through a mutual friend.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.880 align:middle line:90%
He said that.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.870 align:middle line:90%
So I typed it up.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.995 align:middle line:90%
It's in the book, page 435.

00:39:18.995 --> 00:39:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before I
ever told you that.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Exactly.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.810 align:middle line:90%
Before we spoke about it.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:23.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's on page 435.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing thing.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: And then when we
were talking the other day,

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:10%
I asked you--

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:28.990 align:middle line:10%
I said, so did
you ever meet him?

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.620 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You didn't know.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And you said
verbatim exactly what

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:33.865 align:middle line:90%
he told us from the other side.

00:39:33.865 --> 00:39:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rickles remembers.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:36.565 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: So here's the thing.

00:39:36.565 --> 00:39:39.760 align:middle line:10%
All of our loved ones exist.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.270 align:middle line:10%
We exist in this sort
of semi-conscious state

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.710 align:middle line:10%
while we're here.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:84%
But when we're back home,
we're much awakened and aware,

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:90%
and we can communicate.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to
change your journey.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.962 align:middle line:84%
We can't give you
the lottery numbers.

00:39:55.962 --> 00:39:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But we will tell you
things like, yeah, I

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.025 align:middle line:84%
met you in Vegas backstage
from a mutual friend.

00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:00.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:40:00.825 --> 00:40:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Rich, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:03.590 align:middle line:90%
You're a delight.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Oh, no,
you're a delight.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rich Martini.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.300 align:middle line:10%
Look, I'm in no rush to
get to the flip side.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But if I do, I'm coming back
to talk through Rich Martini.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
