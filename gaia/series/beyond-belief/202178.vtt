00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
Our special guest,
Karen Dahlman,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:10%
is with us, the noted
author, spirit communicator,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:10%
channeler for wisdom source.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And she is also, of
course, a very experienced

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.680 align:middle line:90%
hypnotherapist.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program, Karen.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, George.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be back with you.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you were with us
a couple of years ago as we

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
Ouija board, I think.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:84%
It's probably a bit more
than a couple of years,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
but, yeah, it's so
wonderful be back here.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more that
has happened with my work

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:90%
with the Ouija board.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> How come you are so into the
Ouija board where most people

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:90%
are petrified?

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.873 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say I'm petrified
of it, I just don't like it.

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's fair enough.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:10%
You know, not everybody-- it's
not everybody's favorite tool.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.947 align:middle line:10%
But, see, I've always
approached it as a tool and not

00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:10%
as a toy or a game, and
I've had great results.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:10%
It's just another
form of channeling.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:10%
It's no different than
maybe using Oracle cards

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:10%
and reaching out to a spirit,
or no different than voice

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:10%
channeling or receiving
messages telepathically.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I just happen to receive
them through a tool.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> If you handle it badly,
though, will something happen?

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not in my case.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have to say this.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.357 align:middle line:84%
What you believe is what you
receive, and what you receive

00:01:29.357 --> 00:01:31.182 align:middle line:84%
is actually because
of what you conceived.

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So it all goes back
to your belief.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:84%
If you believe you're going to
get something more negative,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get that
because in life, you're going

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:90%
to attract that to you anyway.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> You walk down the street
with a chip on your shoulder,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
you're going to track
probably bad things to you.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with the tool.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
By the way, it's not the
board that does the work,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:90%
the board is 100% neutral.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:90%
It's ourselves that do the work.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So inherently, if you're a
person that comes to this tool

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and has an intention of I
would like to reach my guides

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.357 align:middle line:84%
or my beloved, deceased,
transitioned people

00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
or animals in my life, you
can have an opportunity

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to reach that as opposed
to something negative.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you go about it
and you're joking about it

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.801 align:middle line:84%
and not taking it
too seriously, that's

00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:84%
when you're going to probably
pull in lower energies.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.480 align:middle line:84%
But that does not
have to be the case,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and I know today we're going
to talk more about that.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Now has Hollywood kind of
distorted things with the Ouija

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:90%
board?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they have.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.235 align:middle line:84%
I have to say there's always
been folklore and myths

00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
about the Ouija board for
years even when the board first

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:90%
came out.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
There are stories that go
way back to the early 1900s.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.820 align:middle line:84%
There was always something
about this device

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.453 align:middle line:84%
because you're tapping
into it originally,

00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
people thought you
used it to talk

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
to the deceased,
transition people,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:90%
but it's so much more now.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
But when they did
that, people would say

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:90%
what happens in the afterlife?

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
So it became this
mysterious thing

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and we want to create
stories, folklore around it.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:90%
So the tales began.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And so Hollywood
learned to run with it.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Earlier on, there's
some movies, even

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:90%
in the 50s and 60s about it.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
But it was, that
movie that came out,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:90%
"The Exorcist," we all know it.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.242 align:middle line:90%
That was-- it was December 26--

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:04.117 align:middle line:90%
[MAKES BUZZING SOUND]

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.180 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:84%
The Ouija board only had a
cameo appearance in that movie,

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:90%
but it was very profound.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, Hollywood
took something

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
that was in almost
everybody's home at the time.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.602 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the 1920s
and 30s and 40s,

00:03:17.602 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:90%
it was in everybody's parlor.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually think
I had one as a kid.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>> You did, George Noory?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I do.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, well--

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.735 align:middle line:90%
>> I do believe I had that.

00:03:24.735 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Most people did.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.218 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, here it was
when "The Exorcist" came out,

00:03:29.218 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and the book came out a
couple of years earlier--

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.290 align:middle line:84%
we're talking it was 1973
when the movie came out--

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
they took something
that was super popular.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.978 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was in one of the
number one selling games

00:03:38.978 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
at Parker Brothers when
they bought it over

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:90%
from William Fuld.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So they were smart, and they
used it and they capitalized

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:84%
upon that fear and the
mysterious nature of it,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and it worked.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>> How did the Karen Dahlman
get involved in the supernatural

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.903 align:middle line:90%
and the paranormal?

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, George,
this goes way back.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
When I came into
this world, and I

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
can remember back
to the age of two,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.565 align:middle line:84%
and I had a, what you would
call imaginary playmate,

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:02.652 align:middle line:90%
and it was not imaginary.

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:90%
And how do I know this?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, because it came
back to me as an adult.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:90%
But this is what happened.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to communicate
with this little being.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:90%
His name was Zachy.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.693 align:middle line:84%
He could change sizes,
and he'd accompany me

00:04:14.693 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
on whatever it was I was
doing, playing with my toys

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.897 align:middle line:90%
or outside.

00:04:17.897 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
He'd be with me, and I'd
tell my family about him,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
and they were, like,
there's nothing there.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Quit play pretend.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:90%
You got to go to school.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:90%
You can't do this stuff.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And George, I have to
say, a lot of people

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
fall into this category
of coming into the world

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:84%
with these kind of
imaginary friends

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that really aren't
imaginary, and they're

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:90%
told to discount that.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:90%
They're not really there.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.205 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing
nothing, but I thought

00:04:41.205 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I was going to put him away and
go to school and be a big girl.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of put
him away, but little

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:84%
did I know he still existed
and stayed around me.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a story years ago of a
little girl who would tell her

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:84%
parents about her
imaginary friend, Shaboozy,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and they would laugh at her.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
she came by and said,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
you know, Shaboozy died
here, and they went, what?

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Now they're getting a
little serious here.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, she said
that she was killed here

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and that they buried
her right here.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking-- they're
on top of a linoleum floor

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:90%
and they went, what?

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:90%
And the kid was just insistent.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.823 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, she's buried
right here, right here,

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:90%
and she wouldn't stop.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:90%
She'd talk about this for days.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they called some
authorities and said,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
our little girl is
acting really strange.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're really concerned.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
She talked about a
little girl that died,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and they said,
what's your address

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and we'll get back to you.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So they gave them their address,
and two days later, the cops

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
called and said, you know,
there was a little girl

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
who disappeared in that
house and nobody ever

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:90%
found out what happened to her.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
What's your little
girl saying exactly?

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And the little girl said,
again, she's buried here.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So the folks told
the police that.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, the cops came to
the house with permission

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:84%
to dig up the floor,
and they found

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:90%
the bones of the little girl.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Now how does that happen?

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It happens because children--
you know, the younger you are,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.357 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of
closer to the veil.

00:06:17.357 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just came over
here from not too long earlier

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure she was a
pretty young girl.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.720 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case,
she probably was aware.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.060 align:middle line:84%
That was probably, like,
her friend that she had.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And her name was
"Shamboozy," you said?

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, interesting name.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:90%
So that happens, and so--

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Shaboozy.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.428 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd love to say that there's
been a lot of research done

00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:90%
around imaginary playmates.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So researchers in the
University of Oregon

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
did quite a bit of
research into this,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and they found that 2/3 of all
children before the age of 7

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
tend to have some kind
of imaginary friend.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's dramatic.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's interesting--
that goes back to your story--

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.972 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times they
will talk about somebody

00:06:52.972 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
that they'll give them what
they look like, they might give

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
a name, they might give
a certain characteristic

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
about them, and then they
see a photo of somebody

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that was, like, in their family
before, so a deceased relative.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's very common that,
children can see these things.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter if it's, like,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:84%
a pink elephant in the room
and that's their friend,

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and mine was Zachy and
looked like a little sprite.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is we're
communicating with something,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.695 align:middle line:84%
and as long as it's positive,
and mine was very positive,

00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure that
girl's was too.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> But why do they go away?

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
They seem to go away
as you get older.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's because we put
him away for the most part.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.832 align:middle line:84%
We think others
don't believe us.

00:07:28.832 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:84%
They tell us they
don't believe us.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We think we have to
behave a certain way when

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:90%
we go to school.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:84%
We want to be, you
know, a big kid

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.483 align:middle line:84%
and not be made fun
of because we're

00:07:37.483 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
seeing something
others can't see,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and I was very aware
of that myself.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.152 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are.

00:07:42.152 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's interesting,
George, when you try

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:90%
to put this kind of stuff away?

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, your abilities to
reach into the other realms?

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:90%
It comes back.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people as they get
older, might be in their 30s,

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:84%
40s, 50s, they start having
these experiences again.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:84%
That remind them
of what they were

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
able to do when they were the
child, such as maybe seeing

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.547 align:middle line:84%
auras or knowing when the
phone was going to ring,

00:08:03.547 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
or even think back to when they
had a friend that used to show

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:90%
up that nobody else could see.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that happens
to a lot of people.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's 2/3 of the
kids before the age of 7.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>> As we were talking
about the Ouija board,

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:84%
you have a special message
for our "Beyond Belief"

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:90%
audience about them.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:30.968 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.968 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> F R O M T H E A N C O N S T
R U C T T O S E E E V I L. OK,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we go
ahead and read it.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so this is
what it looks like.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just a lot of letters,
and what I must do next

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:84%
is to go through it and separate
the letters from each other

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
to make words, although I can
see the words in here right

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:90%
now, so this is what it says.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>> What did it say?

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, OK, so that was the
guides that come through.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about the
guides in a little bit,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:84%
but this is the
message they wanted

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
to give to you and the
audience here today.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>> They said from the beginning
of this to the end of this

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:84%
time, we say as always that
belief like all things in life

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:90%
is a choice.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:90%
So choose to or not to.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:84%
This is for you to decide for
all things, big and small.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the message and decide
if it has meaning in your life,

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and see the message and
do with it what you will.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Accept or discard
as you see fit.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:84%
To bring forth truth,
source is what we do.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
We seek to share
wisdom and not evil,

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:90%
for evil is a human construct.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And although there
are evil acts,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.320 align:middle line:84%
they are the choice of
those committing those acts.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:84%
To see an act such
as this before you,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and judge it as evil
is also a choice,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.680 align:middle line:84%
if what you see before
you choose to see as evil,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.380 align:middle line:90%
then flee and do not look back.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But please understand
evil will follow.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Not because of this
message or the method

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:84%
in which the message
was delivered,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
but rather that you
choose to see evil.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Now who was the other person
on the planchette that--

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>> That's my board
partner, Rodney.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:84%
He's been my board partner for
about six, seven years now.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we know Rodney is not
playing with the planchette,

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.313 align:middle line:84%
or you're not playing with
the planchette to come up with

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:08.480 align:middle line:90%
those letters to write that?

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Listen, that's
a fair question.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.770 align:middle line:90%
You know, you don't know.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:84%
You only have to go
by what you feel.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So what the guides would
say, to answer that question,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
would say it's not so much
what is happening here,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and you think she's pushing
it, he's pushing it,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:90%
they're making it up.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The key is that how does
the message sound to you?

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:90%
How does it resonate with you?

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd say the
same thing too.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:90%
I've never pushed it.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle line:90%
I never will push it.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's because I really
believe in the validity

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:90%
of this tool to use it.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you just
lightly touching it?

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're doing?

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Very lightly.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, George, I usually
have just one little finger

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:90%
on the planchette.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.920 align:middle line:84%
My partner there there,
I think, using one hand

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
with about three, four,
maybe four fingers sometimes.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.573 align:middle line:84%
It actually moves-- it
moves and you follow it.

00:11:50.573 --> 00:11:51.615 align:middle line:90%
It's a pulling sensation.

00:11:51.615 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> How does this take
to move generally?

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, for me, right away.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it does?

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, immediately.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Right what you saw there on
that video was us sitting down

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:90%
right from the get go starting.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Now who's moving
it in terms of--

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
if it's coming from some
supernatural source,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:90%
how are they doing this?

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.018 align:middle line:84%
So I love that because
people want to know,

00:12:13.018 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
are you supposed to
move it yourself?

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.727 align:middle line:90%
Do they pick up and feel it?

00:12:15.727 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:90%
I say no.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:84%
You sit there and wait
patiently for it to move.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.678 align:middle line:84%
>> And it just starts
sliding you along--

00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It starts to
move and it pulls.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a pulling
sensation, and all

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:84%
we do is just stay
on for dear life.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:90%
We just follow it.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:90%
That's all we do.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you need to
ask it a question?

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, ask it a question.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:84%
In this case and
what we just watched,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, what is
the message you'd

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.035 align:middle line:84%
like to give George
and the audience here?

00:12:35.035 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's they said.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%
We'd like to give
them this message.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That seems like a very
uplifting response from them.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't see anything
evil there at all.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely not.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So the key is the people
think the method of the board

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
is evil where it's
not the board at all.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:90%
I got to refrain.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:90%
I got to say it one more time.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not the board.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's ourselves
that do this work.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> If Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial
killer who's now dead was using

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that board, touching the
planchette as a human,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.500 align:middle line:84%
what would probably
come out of that?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you know--

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Evil things?

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is the deal.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.268 align:middle line:84%
What you harbor within and
what you believe within

00:13:10.268 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
is what you're going to attract
and what you're going to get.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a magnet.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.600 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely like a magnet.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.642 align:middle line:84%
You know, what you give
out is what you get back.

00:13:17.642 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind-- the
law of attraction.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.597 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do so many
people fear the board?

00:13:22.597 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they fear--

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I think we hit on it a little
bit about what happened

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:90%
with "The Exorcist" movie.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's something
that's mysterious in nature.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
You can't explain it, and
because of those reasons,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:84%
people make up their
own stories around it.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And their stories tend to have
to do with, oh, it's spooky.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
When the board first came
out back in the 1890s,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.930 align:middle line:90%
let's say, when Ouija came out.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.557 align:middle line:84%
It was 1886 when people
started using a talking board.

00:13:45.557 --> 00:13:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But when it first came
out, the spiritual movement

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:90%
was using it.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So the boards were only
used to communicate

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.917 align:middle line:90%
with the transition, the dead.

00:13:52.917 --> 00:13:54.375 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned
over the years is

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:57.443 align:middle line:84%
you can use it for so many
more things than that.

00:13:57.443 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why, you know,
for me, it's not scary.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But for other people,
because you're

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:84%
talking to the dead, which
some people don't believe

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.725 align:middle line:90%
the dead even exists.

00:14:03.725 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't know
what the afterlife is about

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do we know?

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:90%
We haven't been there.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.642 align:middle line:84%
If we'd been there, we wouldn't
be sitting here, right?

00:14:09.642 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think because of the
folklore created around that,

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.792 align:middle line:90%
that's what scares people.

00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:84%
It's our superstitions
we've created around it.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it primarily a board
to deal with the afterlife?

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
it's-- no, it's not.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:90%
And so here, I brought my board.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:84%
This is my original
board I got, George.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:90%
This was given to me in 19--

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Hold that up to the camera.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>> This was given to me in 1973,
December 25th, and the 26th,

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:90%
"The Exorcist" came out.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So I like this
board because it was

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.358 align:middle line:90%
the first one I started with.

00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>> What's it made out of?

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.942 align:middle line:84%
>> This is compressed
particle board.

00:14:39.942 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you touched it.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Well.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.360 align:middle line:90%
[IMITATES HYPNOTIZED SOUND]

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens now.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.215 align:middle line:84%
So the board, it was originally
thought to be for that reason.

00:14:51.215 --> 00:14:52.965 align:middle line:84%
The people who created
the board were just

00:14:52.965 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:84%
a businessman and a
businesswoman who created it,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.135 align:middle line:84%
and they just saw it as an
opportunity to make money.

00:14:58.135 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> To make money.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.135 align:middle line:90%
It was a business decision.

00:15:00.135 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
along the way is

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
people that were in
the spiritual movement

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:84%
were looking for a more
creative, quicker way than--

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.153 align:middle line:84%
and cheaper way than
going to maybe say

00:15:10.153 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:84%
answers they had to
pay for, and there's

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:90%
a lot of trickery and deceit.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Lots of trickery.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and they could do it
themselves now in their parlor

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.590 align:middle line:84%
by themselves and have that
communication with people.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The loved ones that just
died in the Civil War.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, why do people say
that evil spirits come over

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:90%
the board?

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if evil spirits
come, again, it's your own--

00:15:28.592 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:90%
it's a human construct.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back with
what the guides told us.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It's something we create.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:90%
It has harbored within man.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.600 align:middle line:90%
We do evil things to each other.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Has nothing to do with
anything coming over the board.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:84%
The energy comes through
and connects with you,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and then it moves
the planchette.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not coming in
the board at all.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a
movement that happens.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And so you asked earlier,
how does this work.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So what the guides
have shared with me

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.490 align:middle line:84%
over the years is that it's
like three energies coming

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:90%
together--

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
me, my partner if you're
using the board with somebody,

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and the third energy is the
beings or entities or groups

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:90%
you're communicating with.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:84%
They come in, you raise
your vibration, you meet,

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and through that channeling--
it's a channeling again--

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
energy starts flowing.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can channel
with your voice--

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%
telepathy.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.593 align:middle line:84%
You start flowing this way
with your mouth, the sound,

00:16:13.593 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:84%
or you can channel like
this with your fingers

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.940 align:middle line:84%
on a planchette or
automatic writing.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same thing.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:90%
The energy flows through.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Afterlife expert Roberta
Grimes talked with me about

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:84%
the other side, and she
thinks it's a better place.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:10%
So when the time comes--

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Party time!

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:10%
>> --so be it.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.150 align:middle line:10%
>> What do you
mean "party time?"

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.680 align:middle line:10%
What do you do on
the other side?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:10%
You go dancing?

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:10%
What do you do?

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:10%
>> You do whatever
you want to do.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:10%
It's beautiful.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:10%
You have a body that is young.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.590 align:middle line:10%
Typically we choose
to look the way

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:10%
we looked in our more most
recent lifetime when we were

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.838 align:middle line:10%
maybe 25 to 35, that range,
because that's when we usually

00:16:49.838 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:10%
looked and felt the best.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>> My hair was too long then.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:10%
I didn't--

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you know what?

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:10%
You can have shorter hair.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:10%
You can redesign your body.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:10%
You could have a body from an
earlier lifetime if you choose.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.760 align:middle line:10%
But that body is equipped
with sensory organs

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:10%
that are much stronger.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.359 align:middle line:10%
People say you've
never heard music

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:10%
unless you heard it there.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:10%
It's-- the music
is extraordinary.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:10%
You can't-- even people who--
there was one fellow who died

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:10%
100-some years ago.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.974 align:middle line:10%
His family was worried
because he was almost blind.

00:17:18.974 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:10%
And they said, well,
can you see better, Dad?

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.890 align:middle line:10%
And he said, I'll tell
you how well I can see.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:10%
About 50 miles from
here, it looks like there

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:10%
are beautiful mountains--

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.399 align:middle line:10%
Rocky Mountains.

00:17:28.399 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>> 50 miles?

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:10%
I can see-- so--

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you could
see that far here.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:10%
>> You know?

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:10%
>> And he said that in
front of those mountains,

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:10%
there are foothills
covered with trees.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:10%
I can see from here every
leaf on every tree on all

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:10%
of those foothills.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:10%
>> That's pretty good vision.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Excellent.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.322 align:middle line:10%
And it's almost panoramic.

00:17:48.322 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:10%
We don't think it's quite
panoramic, but pretty much.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.697 align:middle line:10%
So you can see what's behind
you and all around you.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Is the afterlife almost
like the physical life?

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, do they
watch television?

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.183 align:middle line:10%
Do they listen to
my show on radio?

00:17:59.183 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:10%
>> That's an
interesting question.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.960 align:middle line:10%
Because what I read
was all 100 years ago,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:10%
there was no technology at all.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:10%
So they have no basis.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:10%
>> More recently, there's
quite a bit more technology.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.003 align:middle line:10%
For example, my
mother showed me--

00:18:16.003 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:10%
we were working with--

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.670 align:middle line:10%
I was working with a
medium, and my mother

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:10%
showed the medium that there's
a big TV on their wall.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:10%
She said using this TV, I can
watch my loved ones on Earth

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.390 align:middle line:10%
any time I want to.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:10%
I just turn it on and I love--

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.777 align:middle line:10%
I love watching Roberta 'cause
she's always up to something.

00:18:33.777 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I would hope they were
watching "Beyond Belief"

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I have no doubt.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:90%
I bet they are.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Now what did you
think of Roberta?

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think she's
onto something here.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I also think it's so much
more complex than that too.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.280 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned from
communicating with the deceased

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.202 align:middle line:84%
for 47 years now,
I've learned that it's

00:18:50.202 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
very much like what
she said, but there's

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:90%
other aspects to it.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you want to go
experience a more physical

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:90%
realm like we have here.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And have the TV and
watch "Beyond Belief"

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.387 align:middle line:84%
and all those wonderful shows
like that, you can do that.

00:19:03.387 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you also
want to go off and explore.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
It's really up to the
evolution of your soul.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:84%
You get to choose
what you decide to do,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and the power of your
thought is paramount there.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:84%
The power of your
thought will allow

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:84%
you to take you to
any other region

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.268 align:middle line:90%
and where about you want to go.

00:19:18.268 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
limited to something

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:90%
that looks like Earth.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:90%
It could be so much more.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's a couple of
people I'm communicating

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:84%
with right now who have
transitioned more recently,

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and they are out
there exploring.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond just being
yourself at the age of 35.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:10%
In fact, one of my--

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:10%
I would call them my contacts
on the other side said that she

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:10%
can project herself to be the
two-year-old self she was,

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:10%
the--

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:10%
let's say 40-year-old
self she was,

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:10%
and even the 99-year-old self
she never was in this life.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.657 align:middle line:84%
>> It's because you have
the ability to fathom that.

00:19:53.657 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
If you can find that
and believe that,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:84%
you can create reality
that fast and that quick.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So you could even put
yourself into other planets

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:90%
and other dimensions.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- I say yes
to what Roberta says,

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.530 align:middle line:84%
but it's a lot more
complicated and complex.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you communicate with the
devil through the Ouija board?

00:20:09.348 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> If you believe in the devil,
you sure can communicate with

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.790 align:middle line:84%
any kind of energy
you choose to.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:84%
You can communicate anything
that you think is sentiment.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I don't believe
in a physical devil.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.717 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the evil in
humanity or in our hearts

00:20:21.717 --> 00:20:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that we hold and harbor,
and we're doing right now

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:90%
in our world around us.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you believe in
the devil, sure, you

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
can probably bring that
forward, but is that a tulpa?

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Is that a thought form?

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Is this something
that's really legit?

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say life
is hard enough as it is.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Why would you want to create
more havoc within your life?

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You use the Ouija board
as a very positive tool

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:90%
for yourself, don't you?

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:45.258 align:middle line:90%
How do you apply it?

00:20:45.258 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I've done that
from the beginning.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And you know, George, I
think because I was so young,

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I was the age of eight when I
got my first board from Santa

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Claus.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.320 align:middle line:90%
I used it in a vacuum.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Way to go, Santa.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:90%
I love Santa-- good Santa.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.917 align:middle line:84%
And I think because
I didn't have that--

00:21:01.917 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, the stigma
around it with my family,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing
to fear about it.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I could go to
church the next day.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I could-- even in the
morning when I got my board,

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I went to church that
morning, you know?

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:90%
It was normal.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:90%
It was just a tool.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't see it
as anything evil,

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.593 align:middle line:84%
and I never was around
people that saw it that way.

00:21:18.593 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was no
social media back then.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I did
it all on my own.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
There's no books
really about it.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>> This was your social media.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, my board.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.280 align:middle line:90%
It was my great cosmic--

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>> To reach the other side.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>> My great cosmic phone.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.042 align:middle line:90%
I can dial up anything with it.

00:21:30.042 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> You still use it?

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I do, George, but not as
much as I used to use it.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I would say more I'm using
it maybe once a month

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:84%
now where I do more
direct channeling,

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:84%
or I work with other beings
through other techniques.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Why have you
reduced your usage?

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I find, as you
can see on that video we looked

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:90%
at earlier, it's very slow.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And so--

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.487 align:middle line:84%
>> But you can do it
by yourself, right?

00:21:51.487 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I can, and it's
still just as slow.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And so for that message
we got that you saw,

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.800 align:middle line:84%
it was a few paragraphs, that
took us probably 25 minutes--

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:90%
20 minutes at least.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.195 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a
laborious process.

00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And so for me to speed up and
not lose any of the meaning

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.640 align:middle line:84%
in the downloads I
get, it's better for me

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
to do it voice channeling
or get the telepathy

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and then express
what they're saying.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We're trying to connect
with our higher selves.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.670 align:middle line:84%
One of your favorites
on "Open Minds"

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:84%
is Regina Meredith, who talked
with channeler, Leigh Harris,

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:84%
about listening to
voices in your head.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's interesting
as I was reading in your book,

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
it was as though you started
hearing voices in your head,

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.300 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
necessarily your own.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, this happens
to a lot of people.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
They think where
did that come from?

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But most people will just simply
brush it aside and say, oh,

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
well that was random
and just ignore it.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.640 align:middle line:84%
What made you not ignore it
when that started happening?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it was too helpful
and that wasn't my own voices.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:10%
So the way I've talked about
it, I was 23 at the time

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:10%
and I had a lot of my own
self attack and my own self

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:56.490 align:middle line:10%
judgment.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.420 align:middle line:10%
So this voice was
completely different.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:10%
So my thoughts would tend to
be fairly inward or downward

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.885 align:middle line:10%
on myself.

00:23:02.885 --> 00:23:04.260 align:middle line:10%
And then all of
a sudden one day,

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:10%
I was on the
Underground in London,

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.090 align:middle line:10%
and I just heard this
very clear voice.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And the clear voice was then
accessible from that day

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.807 align:middle line:84%
to this day and I asked
lots of questions.

00:23:15.807 --> 00:23:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, is
this-- are you my guides?

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.973 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, yes, we
are essentially your guides.

00:23:19.973 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:10%
And as the years
have gone on, I've

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:10%
had a different
understanding and a kind

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:24.690 align:middle line:10%
of wider understanding of it.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.482 align:middle line:10%
But at the time that
was what I understood.

00:23:26.482 --> 00:23:30.190 align:middle line:10%
I had accessed my higher self,
which I don't think I really--

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:10%
it felt too easy.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you read the book how
to access your higher self,

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
you think, well, this must
be some big mystical thing.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't understand
how it had clicked.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:84%
But what I've since
come to understand,

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and they've said this to me,
is that you were hearing us

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.740 align:middle line:84%
for a long time,
but you couldn't

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:90%
make clear auditory connection.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:10%
And then there came a
day when I was ready to.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I just did a
lot of personal study,

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and through that, the words
and the advice they were giving

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:84%
was so validating and
expanding to my own life.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:10%
I was like, OK, well, even if
this is some kind of madness,

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.655 align:middle line:10%
it's really useful.

00:24:05.655 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, there you go.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.747 align:middle line:84%
>> He seems to be
spot on, Karen.

00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I think-- and I am familiar
with Leigh Harris's work.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm very-- I think
he's very much spot on.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.202 align:middle line:84%
I think he's very on it when
he talks about the higher self.

00:24:17.202 --> 00:24:19.160 align:middle line:84%
What happens is-- OK, so
this is my experience.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I'll get into that.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It was in 1989 when I had
three different friends of mine

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:26.085 align:middle line:84%
who were very interested in
exploring the Ouija board more.

00:24:26.085 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, I was kind of
done talking to the transition

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.590 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.173 align:middle line:84%
And I thought why
couldn't we use this

00:24:31.173 --> 00:24:32.830 align:middle line:90%
to talk to our higher selves?

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So for about four
years, we exclusively

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:84%
spoke to our higher
selves to the board.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Successfully?

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, successfully.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.295 align:middle line:84%
Just like he said, you
start hearing things,

00:24:41.295 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and we were getting it
through the board now.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.690 align:middle line:84%
But what we had happening
was our higher selves

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.950 align:middle line:84%
would give us messages to
help us through our lives,

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:84%
but also our higher selves would
talk to each other's higher

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.868 align:middle line:84%
selves, and sometimes
their higher selves

00:24:51.868 --> 00:24:53.065 align:middle line:90%
might talk to me directly.

00:24:53.065 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So we had this whole
like group therapy

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:84%
going on between the
higher selves and us.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:90%
We were young.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.470 align:middle line:90%
I was in my late 20s.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We were becoming--
I was a therapist,

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.463 align:middle line:84%
and all my friends
were professionals,

00:25:01.463 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and we were learning
things in life,

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.385 align:middle line:84%
and it really was very
practical stuff we could use.

00:25:06.385 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is that once you

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.593 align:middle line:84%
start working
through higher self,

00:25:09.593 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:84%
then you start
opening yourself up

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:84%
to even more possibilities
of connection.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Back to source,
back to all that is,

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and to all the sentient
beings that are out there.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right on.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I did a Ouija board show
almost on "Coast to Coast."

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I say almost
is because on the air,

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.700 align:middle line:90%
I canceled the segment.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I had three guests
in the studio.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bruce Goldberg, the
hypnotherapist, Jordan Maxwell,

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:84%
who sees all, and our dear
friend, the late Rosemary Ellen

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Guiley.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Rosemary-- and I had a vote, and
then I had the final decision.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.467 align:middle line:90%
Rosemary said go for the show.

00:25:48.467 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
This was on the air, and
we're talking about this.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:90%
She said do the program.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Do the show on the Ouija board.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm all for it.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Goldberg was on the fence, and
Jordan Maxwell was shaking.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:90%
He was so opposed to it.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I made the decision
not to do the program.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I had more emails
from people all upset

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't do the show.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.550 align:middle line:84%
One group of people said we just
ordered 20 pizzas for a pizza

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:90%
party and you ruined it.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I stopped it because I felt that
I would contribute to somebody

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
doing something bad or evil, or
attracting something that they

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:90%
should have attracted.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.107 align:middle line:90%
Was I right or wrong?

00:26:32.107 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say you're wrong
because what makes you think

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that you have that power
over other people's decisions

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:90%
and choices?

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.958 align:middle line:84%
Remember, what we
create in our lives

00:26:40.958 --> 00:26:42.750 align:middle line:84%
is really what we
believe within ourselves,

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.375 align:middle line:84%
and so you can't
influence that at all.

00:26:44.375 --> 00:26:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it wasn't where I was
thinking I had the power.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought the board
had the power.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> The board has no power.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's ourselves.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what you said.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So I would be worried
about the operators.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Definitely not with Rosemary,
because Rosemary and I

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.770 align:middle line:90%
used to use the board together.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.107 align:middle line:84%
>> It worked wonderfully,
but I'd be worried--

00:26:58.107 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you two
still do somehow--

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.005 align:middle line:90%
>> I would say, yes, we do.

00:27:01.005 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>> --from the other side.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>> We do.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.365 align:middle line:84%
So I would be worried about
that and not the board

00:27:04.365 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:84%
at all, and not anything coming
bad through unless these people

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that sat at the board were
wanting to have negativity.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Some probably did, and I
didn't want to be responsible

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I was listening
in that night during that show,

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> You remember that?

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I totally remember it, and
I was very disappointed as you

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:90%
can imagine.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>> You were on Rosemary's side.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Go for it, do it.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I actually-- I was.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.878 align:middle line:84%
But I remember one time on
your show, we also did a poll.

00:27:25.878 --> 00:27:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And they did a poll
about the Ouija board--

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
was it something you
should use or not use?

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And do you remember what the
ratings were on that poll?

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.098 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, 51% said
yes, 49% said no.

00:27:36.098 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:90%
So a little bit more than half.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That's huge.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> That's huge.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it's changed
over the years.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Karen, who is Hermes the Cat?

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Hermes is a cat of mine
I had many years ago who's no

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:90%
longer with me.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> There he is.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:90%
I used to call him--

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful cat.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, beautiful.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:90%
My big fat pumpkin cat.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at those eyes.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, Hermes taught me about
how to communicate with animals

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:90%
through the Ouija board.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I never expected
in a million years--

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what happened
when I started

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:90%
talking to my higher self--

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.495 align:middle line:90%
we did that for four years.

00:28:04.495 --> 00:28:06.203 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know,
the extraterrestrial

00:28:06.203 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:90%
started coming through--

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.445 align:middle line:84%
>> --the board-- I'm
not even done yet.

00:28:09.445 --> 00:28:13.360 align:middle line:84%
The angelic kingdom, and then
came the guides, who I'm now--

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking
to you since 1994.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And then January
26, 1996, Hermes

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:20.830 align:middle line:90%
the Cat came through the board.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I was using the board with
my partner at the time.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> After it had passed?

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.677 align:middle line:90%
>> No, listen to this.

00:28:25.677 --> 00:28:27.677 align:middle line:84%
This is going-- this is
a new part of the story.

00:28:27.677 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
You're going to like
this one, George.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.142 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was
we're using the board.

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:33.070 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to my
angel, and the angel

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:35.908 align:middle line:84%
said you're not going to believe
who wants to talk to you.

00:28:35.908 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
hey, bring them on.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.717 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a lot of different
beings on this board.

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
the planchette slowed down.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.950 align:middle line:84%
It kind of went in a different
direction a little more slower,

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and it spelled out
"Hermes cat I love you."

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.455 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I did.

00:28:50.455 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I said, are you kidding me?

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Mary Angel, we can
talk to animals?

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:90%
She said yes.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.460 align:middle line:84%
George, that cat was very
much alive sitting right there

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:90%
in a chair looking at me.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.077 align:middle line:90%
>> I said, how is this possible?

00:29:02.077 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Listen, this blew my mind.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.452 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't going to believe this.

00:29:04.452 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:90%
It's 1996 now.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, what happens
is the animals have a sensation

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.090 align:middle line:90%
and feeling.

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:84%
They give out pictures
and images in their mind

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.782 align:middle line:90%
or feelings, we interpret that.

00:29:14.782 --> 00:29:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're the ones that
are doing the spelling.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.615 align:middle line:90%
>> That's remarkable.

00:29:17.615 --> 00:29:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that amazing?

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that's an
animal that was alive.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.820 align:middle line:90%
So that blew my mind, George.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.650 align:middle line:90%
I thought, wait a second.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.783 align:middle line:84%
You mean, I can talk to
beings that are also alive?

00:29:25.783 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Now I knew we could talk
to our higher selves.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:90%
We're alive.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But we can talk to a being
that's absolutely sitting here

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:84%
right here, 100 percent in
this world, in this realm,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:90%
in corporeal existence?

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:90%
That blew my mind.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What did they say
about the other side?

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.410 align:middle line:90%
How do they describe it?

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> The cats or the people?

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Anyone?

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll tell you what,
the animals and the people say

00:29:46.038 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:90%
something very similar.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.557 align:middle line:84%
What I've heard
from the people is

00:29:48.557 --> 00:29:50.350 align:middle line:84%
it takes a little bit
of time to adjust.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:84%
The animals say
the same thing too,

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'll explain that how
the animals are slightly

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:90%
a little different.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.962 align:middle line:90%
When people pass over at first--

00:29:56.962 --> 00:29:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I like to use the
word "transition"

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
because what the spirit
guides say is we understand

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.987 align:middle line:90%
you use the word death.

00:30:01.987 --> 00:30:02.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't know death.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that life
after life after life.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.040 align:middle line:90%
You will always exist.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So when people transition into
their spirit form, what happens

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.448 align:middle line:84%
is there's a period of
time to adjust to it.

00:30:12.448 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there might
be a life review.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:84%
There might be-- you know,
they're paying attention

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.560 align:middle line:84%
to the loved ones
they left behind,

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
make sure they're OK.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But what's happened, though,
is that they can hear and feel

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:84%
the sensation of every single
prayer being sent to them.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Every time your
name is murmured.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Every time they're
thought of, it's

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:84%
all this coming at them,
like a cacophony of sounds.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And they have to find
the time to build a--

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.168 align:middle line:90%
siphon through it.

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is what's interesting.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:84%
They all tell me it's like
I'm sitting on the lap of God

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:90%
or lap of source.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm surrounded, enveloped
in all that is energy,

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's so loving, and I'm
surrounded by pure love.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I can
hear simultaneously

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
every single words, thoughts
questions, prayers sent to us.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And I could be engaged in
each of those conversations

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:84%
fully without
losing a piece of it

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and hear them all
at the same time.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So you sent us a couple
images of the labyrinth

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:90%
in Angel Valley in Sedona.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.870 align:middle line:90%
They are fascinating.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:14.434 align:middle line:84%
But explain to us what they
are and what they mean.

00:31:14.434 --> 00:31:15.290 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the labyrinth that's
created after the one in Chard,

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:90%
France, in that cathedral there.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.815 align:middle line:84%
And you walk it with an
intention, and it's full size.

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's a
pretty good size.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Who made that?

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.207 align:middle line:84%
>> It was made by the people
there at Angel Valley.

00:31:30.207 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, and
what's this one now?

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>> This is called the
Hearts of Hearts Vortex.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> How big is this?

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> This is, I would
say, 50 feet wide and--

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>> --30 feet-- somewhere
in that dimension.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And this really is
a vortex of energy.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So when you go there
and stand in it,

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
things can happen if you
set the right intentions.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:84%
What about our
spirit guides, Karen?

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.410 align:middle line:84%
What do they have
to do with this?

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll you what the
spirit guides have to do with

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.320 align:middle line:90%
those images we just looked at.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Sedona, and
especially, specifically,

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Angel Valley because I wanted
to bring back who I originally

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.560 align:middle line:90%
would see when I was a child.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.977 align:middle line:84%
So I used to see these
beings called The Guardians.

00:32:06.977 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> You wanted to see them again?

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I did because they're
very loving, benevolent,

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.823 align:middle line:84%
just incredible beings
that I saw as a child.

00:32:13.823 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I also wanted to be curious
if I could open my heart

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.808 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see Zachy again.

00:32:17.808 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through
with the intentions--

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.410 align:middle line:84%
I started at that vortex, the
Heart of the Hearts standing

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:22.690 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And when I was finished
with my meditation,

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I was opening my
heart again to be

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:84%
able to see into
those dimensions.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that part of that
had to do with my third eye.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Really developed
my pineal glands--

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Which we all have.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.748 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have and we
have to work at it.

00:32:36.748 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:90%
It's like a muscle that can--

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:90%
atrophy--

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:40.343 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to open it.

00:32:40.343 --> 00:32:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to
open it and use it.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.185 align:middle line:84%
>> And as a child,
most children use it.

00:32:44.185 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:84%
As adults, we kind
of get away from it.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to get back to that.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.315 align:middle line:84%
So I had an intention
to open my heart,

00:32:50.315 --> 00:32:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that was connected
to the pineal gland.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
looked up, and the sky

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.820 align:middle line:84%
was this incredible
heart-shaped cloud,

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.160 align:middle line:84%
it was clouds that
formed a heart.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I walked over to the
giant Chard labyrinth we just

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:90%
saw, and I walked that.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:84%
That whole thing, very slowly,
with the purpose and intention

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.290 align:middle line:84%
of I want to open
up my heart and also

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.810 align:middle line:84%
be connected to my
pineal gland again.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you feel energy
when you're in there?

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my gosh, yes.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
individual again.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I went in there was such
a serious nature about it.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.475 align:middle line:84%
I was with some friends, but we
all stood back while each of us

00:33:23.475 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:84%
walked it so we had
our privacy with it.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:84%
That's key, having
your own time with it,

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.740 align:middle line:90%
taking your time with it.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.530 align:middle line:84%
When I got to the
middle, I had--

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I did a little prayer
and I came out,

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:90%
everything opened up for me.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden I
started getting images.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.910 align:middle line:90%
I started hearing things.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.023 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy.

00:33:40.023 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's because,
George, I was ready.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
say Sedona did it

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:90%
or Angel Valley did it to me.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say because
I was ready for it.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.975 align:middle line:84%
And from that episode
when I got back home,

00:33:49.975 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:84%
I got on the Ouija
board because that's

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.530 align:middle line:84%
one of the places I can go to
and get real solid information.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:57.780 align:middle line:84%
A new group of
beings came through,

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.318 align:middle line:84%
and they came in to teach
me how to use my third eye,

00:34:01.318 --> 00:34:02.610 align:middle line:90%
and it's progressed from there.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you deal at
all with angels?

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.050 align:middle line:90%
My angel was Mary Angel.

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:08.070 align:middle line:90%
She's still around.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Mary Angel?

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, she used to
bring in the animals.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.402 align:middle line:84%
But now when she comes through
and I do sessions for people,

00:34:13.402 --> 00:34:15.360 align:middle line:84%
she'll bring in the ones
that have transitioned

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and help with the people
that are beloved pets

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.820 align:middle line:90%
or loved ones in the afterlife.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.199 align:middle line:90%
>> What do they want?

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.367 align:middle line:84%
What is their
motive, the spirits?

00:34:24.367 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Well it depends what kind of
spirits you want to bring in.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so let's say you
bring in the angelic realm.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.132 align:middle line:84%
Each of the angels have
different functions.

00:34:32.132 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Mary was more there
in the beginning just

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.382 align:middle line:84%
to help me with
animal communication.

00:34:35.382 --> 00:34:36.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they have an agenda?

00:34:36.798 --> 00:34:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Their agenda is
really our agenda.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.550 align:middle line:90%
They're there to support us.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you're working
with a true spirit guide,

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:44.962 align:middle line:84%
they're never going to tell
you what to do, how to do it.

00:34:44.962 --> 00:34:46.170 align:middle line:90%
They're going to support you.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.940 align:middle line:84%
They might bring
circumstances together.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.969 align:middle line:84%
They might suggest, hey,
look at that over there.

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:53.050 align:middle line:84%
They might give you
inspiration and guidance,

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.008 align:middle line:84%
but they're never going
to tell you what to do.

00:34:55.008 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:90%
So the agenda is always ours.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you know you're
working with somebody who has

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.690 align:middle line:90%
your best interests at heart.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:04.680 align:middle line:84%
It would be those that support
you to make your own decisions.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever come across one
of these sessions that happened

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to become so emotional
you just broke down?

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, all the time.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, George,
this happens probably

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.370 align:middle line:84%
75% of the time because the
messages are so poignant.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.382 align:middle line:90%
They're so touching.

00:35:20.382 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Especially when I
work with people.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.980 align:middle line:90%
We do shows for people.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.540 align:middle line:90%
We do private sessions.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> People come with all kinds
of questions and issues and miss

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:84%
people, or they want to
know about their life path.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And when the spirit
guides work with them,

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.350 align:middle line:90%
it's just so beautiful.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.140 align:middle line:90%
And, George, the thing is this.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:84%
When I channel the
guides, whether it's

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:84%
verbally or telepathically
or through the board or even

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.080 align:middle line:90%
automatic writing.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
What happens is I'm
filled with pure love.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:84%
They make me-- by
coming through me,

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:90%
allows me to be a better person.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And I feel the
emotions of the people

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:52.980 align:middle line:90%
that are asking the questions.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.015 align:middle line:84%
I feel the emotions and
the depth of the love,

00:35:56.015 --> 00:35:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's just beautiful
that it brings me to tears.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And often, it brings my
partners or other people

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.010 align:middle line:90%
in the room to tears as well.

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:04.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've got to tell you,
when I first knew that you

00:36:04.385 --> 00:36:07.230 align:middle line:84%
dealt with the Ouija
board years ago,

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe you were some
kind of a dark spirit witch

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You're not.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yeah, no.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I love
witches and I love wiccans.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:10%
I love that whole-- and
I have a lot of friends

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.450 align:middle line:10%
who have practiced with that.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:22.250 align:middle line:10%
I am not.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I am just me being
myself, and I've

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.330 align:middle line:84%
studied a lot of different
traditions and spiritualities

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.800 align:middle line:90%
and different religions.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
understand what's out there.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:35.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, my goal of this
whole thing is, what's beyond?

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.820 align:middle line:10%
What's beyond belief?

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.913 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what we call it.

00:36:37.913 --> 00:36:40.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly, because that's
what I'm out there doing.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm pushing the boundaries
of consciousness

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.080 align:middle line:10%
and I want to know.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, I came into this
world knowing these things

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and seeing these things
and questioning life

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:50.310 align:middle line:84%
at a very young age, and
not having the answers.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been a full journey
back to me, like full circle,

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:84%
to be able to start
connecting with them again

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.370 align:middle line:90%
and to explore these realms.

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been a great
journey for you, hasn't it?

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.203 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been a
fantastic journey.

00:37:01.203 --> 00:37:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't trade
it for the world.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.745 align:middle line:84%
It's probably one of the
most pivotal things that's

00:37:04.745 --> 00:37:06.390 align:middle line:84%
ever happened to me
in my life, working

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.030 align:middle line:84%
with these different beings,
especially when the guides came

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.933 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:37:09.933 --> 00:37:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Karen, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>> George, thank you
so much for having me.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.007 align:middle line:84%
It's a joy and a pleasure
to be here with you.

00:37:15.007 --> 00:37:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful guest.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, you heard it from her.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.440 align:middle line:10%
She loves using the Ouija board.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:90%
As for me?

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not touching it.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:37:25.070 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:90%
