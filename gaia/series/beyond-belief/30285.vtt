We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:18.780 align:middle line:84%

people the information.

with George Noory.

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Since
the beginning of time,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
mankind has tried to
determine his origins.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:84%
On "Beyond Belief"
we're going to explore

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:90%
some of those major questions.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
For more than 40 years,
our special guest

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:84%
has challenged himself
to try to uncover

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
some of the mysteries
of human origins.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's hear it for Lloyd Pye.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.189 align:middle line:90%

>> NOORY: Lloyd, welcome.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.705 align:middle line:90%
>> LLOYD PYE: Thank you.

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:57.655 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, very much.

00:00:57.655 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Good to be with you.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.092 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Always a pleasure
to see and talk to you.

00:01:02.092 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Always, really?

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How are you?

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Very well.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Very well.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did you get
involved in trying to determine

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.626 align:middle line:90%
where the heck we came from?

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: I don't know.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I think I was born
crazy, a little bit,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and just didn't follow
the normal path.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I was always interested
in the unusual.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.794 align:middle line:84%
And I just began to take
it seriously, and then

00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
a little more seriously, and
then a little more seriously.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:90%
And here I am today.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just one of those
kind of follow your nose,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.050 align:middle line:90%
follow your instincts things.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it's a
passion with you, Lloyd.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Oh, absolutely.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because I've
never seen you give up.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:90%
You keep pushing.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to get these
answers, as we all are.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Are we getting any closer to
trying to determine who are we,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:90%
and where we came from?

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Really, I have my
finger on the pulse of a lot

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:90%
of things, just like you do.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think we both
can honestly say

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.526 align:middle line:84%
we're closer now than
we've ever been before

00:01:57.526 --> 00:01:59.025 align:middle line:84%
to those kind of
major breakthroughs

00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:90%
that are going to be needed.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:84%
We're close to breakthroughs
on alien reality

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.395 align:middle line:84%
with the Starchild skull
and other things that

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:90%
are out there.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.269 align:middle line:84%
There's hominid
reality, Bigfoot,

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:90%
and things are going on there.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.251 align:middle line:84%
Intervention theory, there's
a lot of work going on there.

00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
There are just great things
going on across the board.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.999 align:middle line:84%
I think any time
we're going to have

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:90%
major breakthroughs, any day.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This Starchild Project
that you have been working

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
on for just a number of
years, to me, is fascinating.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Tell us how you came about
discovering this skull,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
how old it is, and what
you think it might be.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.995 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Well, I'm
very confident now,

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm very confident that
it is an alien skull.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not a human
hybrid, as we thought

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:90%
it was for quite some time.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it's, without
question, going

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:90%
to prove out to be an alien.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:84%
How it started it
was, it was found

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:84%
in 1930 in a mine
tunnel about 100 miles

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
southwest of
Chihuahua, Mexico, just

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
really, out in the middle of
nowhere, by a teenage girl.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:90%
And she found two skeletons.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:84%
She assumed the
Starchild was just

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:90%
a deformed human of some kind.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:90%
She kept it her whole life.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And when she was dying
in the early '90s,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.266 align:middle line:84%
again, she found it in 1930,
so by then she was an old woman

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and she passed it on
to some people who

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
passed it on to
some more people.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And that couple, Ray and Melanie
Young, in El Paso-- Melanie

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:84%
had been a neonatal
nurse for like 15 years--

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
took one look at it and said,
that's not a human deformity.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Not what I know a
human deformity to be.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So she said to the
couple giving it to them,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.765 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to determine
what this really is.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And they said go to it,
whatever you want to do.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
They tried to get some
mainstream help in El Paso.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And those people that
they took it to just

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
said, it's just a
cradleboarded hydocephalic.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Just forget about it.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Take it home.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.106 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what
does that mean?

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:52.385 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: A cradleboarded
hydocephalic is the simple

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
answer for something that
looks like the Starchild.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It has expanded parietals,
which indicates expanded skull,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
i.e., water on the
brain, hydocephalie.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's very flat in the rear.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that indicates
cradleboarding,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:84%
which is a common practice for
infants in primitive cultures.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.205 align:middle line:84%
You strap the baby
on a board, put it

00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:14.580 align:middle line:84%
on the back of
the mother's back.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.163 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they
elongate the skull.

00:04:16.163 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: No, not the
elongation of the skull.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
All it does is, really, you
tie the baby down onto a board,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.986 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds bad, but you
just basically strap the head

00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:90%
lightly.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It sounds
like torture.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.495 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: I know.

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But you bundle
them, but you have

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.652 align:middle line:84%
to put a strap
around the forehead

00:04:30.652 --> 00:04:32.110 align:middle line:84%
to hold the head
against the board,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
because a babies head is very
big, and its neck is very weak.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So if a mother is working and
stooping and doing all this

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
the head of the baby is going to
do that unless it's tied down.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So in tying it down, again,
just a light strap, but what

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that does is, the bone is so
soft, the rear of the head

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:84%
is flattened from
the top of the crown

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:84%
down to the inion, which is that
bone we all have, right there.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.870 align:middle line:84%
It stops there, because
that's where you neck

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:90%
attaches to your skull.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's about the size
of the palm of my hand,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
that part is flat.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, what the mainstreamers
would do is just say,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
flat means cradleboarding,
even though the Starchild

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:84%
is extensively, to the
size of my whole hand,

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.820 align:middle line:84%
extensively flattened,
including the inion.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's just not cradleboarded.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And it also has its
natural convolutions.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.605 align:middle line:84%
And when a cradleboard
board presses the bone,

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:90%
it becomes as flat as this.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And the human found
with the Starchild

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
has that, has a
cradleboarded head.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You will feel, it's
as flat as that table.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Starchild has
its natural convolutions,

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.270 align:middle line:90%
and you can feel those.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's obvious to anyone,
it's not it's not cradleboarded

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and it's not a hydocephalic.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But it suits the mainstream
purpose to say that and just

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:90%
dismiss it, very easily.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure, it's easy.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.886 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: And it's just wrong.

00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, and, of course,
Lloyd brought us the skull.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at it a
little bit later on "Beyond

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Belief."

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Truly unbelievable.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.327 align:middle line:90%
Now you drove it here.

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Right.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You will
not fly with it.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.618 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Well, we
can't fly with it,

00:06:04.618 --> 00:06:07.139 align:middle line:84%
because we risk it being
seized, number one.

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: But I wanted
it to be here,

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted it
to be on your show,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted people to see,
there are so many trolls,

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:84%
mainstream trolls on the
internet who are out there

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:90%
saying, it's a hoax.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fraud.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm a hustler.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:90%
All of this.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
hard to combat that.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
But to bring it here
for you to see it,

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:90%
for the audience to see it.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's make
sure I don't drop it.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Well, absolutely.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
But for people to see
and put it out there

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:84%
with some imprimatur
of authority,

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:90%
that this really is real.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's absolutely real.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And all it comes
down to is the DNA.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And we've done
enough now on the DNA

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
to know what the final
answer is going to be.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:90%
We've done large portions of it,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and everything we
do indicates it's

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
going to be hundreds
of percent, hundreds

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:84%
of percent different
from normal human.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
There's just no way
to call that anything.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to call
that an aberrant human.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.590 align:middle line:90%
That's an alien.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Lloyd, if it is
extraterrestrial origin,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
kind of paint us a picture on
what you think happened a long

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.960 align:middle line:84%
time ago-- the visitation,
how they decided to breed with

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:90%
humans at the time.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Well, this
individual, the Starchild,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
looks to be a one-off, a
one time only kind of thing.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Now with coneheads, and
we've talked about coneheads

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:84%
before, the ones with
the elongated skulls,

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:90%
they are in the hundreds.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:90%
They lived here.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
They were a population
living here.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:84%
The Starchild seems
to be, I would guess,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:84%
my best guess is, it crashed
and somehow survived it.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Somehow it got isolated here.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.180 align:middle line:90%
It was here for some time.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we've done
isotopic analysis that

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:84%
indicates that it's bone, it was
eating, or at least ingesting,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
the same kinds of food as
the human it was found with,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:84%
for at least a couple years--
at least a couple years.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's an indication that
it was around for a while.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Also there is an
indication that it

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
had a strong bond with the
woman that buried it, because

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:84%
in the mine tunnel,
as they were found,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
she was lying on
her back exposed.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Her skeleton was fully exposed.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:84%
She had buried the
Starchild in a shallow grave

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
in the floor of the mine tunnel,
but she left its hand out

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:90%
of the dirt.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And she called it
a misshapen hand.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what you
meant, exactly, by that.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
She just said, it
was a misshapen hand,

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:90%
misshapen head, misshapen body.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.497 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And she died next
to it, at the same time?

00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: The Starchild
died, she buried it.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, she lugged
it into the middle of nowhere.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Now when you feel the skull,
you'll see it's very light.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
It's much lighter
than you or I. It

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:90%
isn't like lugging a body of us.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So she got it out into
the middle of nowhere

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:90%
into this mine tunnel.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
She buried it in
this shallow grave.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:84%
She left the hand out, and
then she laid down beside it

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and she wrapped that hand
around her own upper arm,

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:90%
and she committed suicide.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.255 align:middle line:84%
There's no other way to get that
scenario that the girl found.

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sad.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: So yeah, it's very
sad or romantic or dramatic

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, she committed
suicide some way,

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
we don't now how, poison, cut
her wrist, cut her throat.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, but
she killed herself.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what the girl
found in 1930, 900 years later.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
We carbon-14 dated both
skulls in separate labs

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:90%
at separate times to be sure.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Both results came
back 900 years.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If it's a
extraterrestrial skull,

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:84%
you call it the Starchild,
how do we know it's just not

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.079 align:middle line:90%
a small ET?

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Well, we don't, really.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I really assume
that it is a small grey,

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
now that I've been with
it for almost 14 years.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.341 align:middle line:84%
My best estimate is
that it's just a grey.

00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And how tall
would it have been?

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: It would have
been about four feet tall.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:84%
The girl said, the woman, the
female, the human, her skull

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
is the size of about a five
foot tall person today.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:84%
The brain was about
1,200 cubic centimeters,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
that size would be.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:84%
You or I are about
1,400 cubic centimeters.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Starchild, while the
skull is the same size,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.875 align:middle line:84%
she said that as it
laid in the grave

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
it was noticeably smaller.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So if the skeleton is five feet,
we assume the one in the grave

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:90%
is at four feet or less.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So we assume it's
about four feet tall.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Unbelievable
discovery.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.766 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: It's truly is, yeah.

00:10:45.766 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't understand why
mainstream science doesn't jump

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:90%
all over this.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: When Ray and Melanie
brought me in on this,

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
almost 14 years
ago, and they said,

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:84%
how long is it going to take
you to find out what this is?

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
this is-- fantastic

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
as it looks, as fantastic as
it might be, I would assume

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.924 align:middle line:84%
mainstream science
will be all over this.

00:11:06.924 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:84%
We'll have an answer probably
somewhere within six months.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:90%
And here we are 14 years later.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:84%
There is huge resistance
huge, huge resistance

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:84%
out there, as you well know,
to the reality of aliens.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going to change
our world the same way

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
the world was changed
500 years ago,

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:84%
when the Earth was moved from
the center of the universe.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.395 align:middle line:84%
The Earth, physically, was moved
from the center of the universe

00:11:31.395 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:90%
to where it actually is.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And now what we are in
the process of doing, you

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and me and others like us, we're
in the process of moving humans

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:84%
away from the biological
center of the universe

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:84%
into becoming just
somebody else out there.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And as big as the shock
was 500 years ago,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:84%
it took 100 years for that
reality to become accepted,

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:90%
to set in.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
it, and can do it,

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in a matter of a few
months, if not a few years.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's a huge change
on the same scale

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people who
are resistant to the idea

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.937 align:middle line:84%
and don't want it to be
true have to accept it.

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, much like
we do on the radio show,

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast AM," we
are interactive with "Beyond

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Belief."

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And that means we're going
to take your questions now

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.310 align:middle line:84%
for Lloyd Pye about
the Starchild Project.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.505 align:middle line:84%
So just raise your hand
and we'll pick you.

00:12:23.505 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yes, sir.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, Mr. Pye,
the red fibers that you found

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:84%
on the skull, that you said
they weren't able to be cut with

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.177 align:middle line:90%
a Dremel tool.

00:12:31.177 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Right.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.884 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Were you able
to take samples on those

00:12:33.884 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and determine what
that might be?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: It's an amazingly
propitious question,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
because, first of
all, let me clear up.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:90%
They're not red fibers.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:84%
There is two parts of
the Starchild's skull

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that are absolutely unknown
in all other bone on earth

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:90%
that we're aware of.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:84%
The fibers woven
through the matrix

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of the bone, which
look like the bone.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a red residue
found in the cancellous holes.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So there are two things,
both of which are not found.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I am just back, I am travelling
from, right now, today, three,

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
four days ago I was at the
Stanford Research Institute

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:84%
scanning it under the most
powerful scanner available

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
in the world today that goes
down to a level of a few cells

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:90%
across.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, very, very fine.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking
for the fibers

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:84%
to try to find a way
to distinguish them.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a function of whether
it's the fibers are themselves

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
a kind of bone, or whether
they're something else.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.922 align:middle line:90%
And we're not sure of that yet.

00:13:43.922 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be a couple weeks

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:84%
before-- the mountain
of data is staggering

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:90%
that this thing produces.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So it will take awhile
to get the result.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But we are trying to determine
if the fibers are available.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:84%
They looked, they
saw what they thought

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:90%
might have been a couple.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But with the microscope
that they had,

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't a fine enough
resolution, at that point.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How expensive
is all this to do?

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: We have some donators
out there at Stanford,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.019 align:middle line:84%
but it costs thousands, you
know, and we don't have that.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:13.685 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:14:13.685 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: So we had to get
donations from people who,

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:84%
at Stanford, are
interested in it.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And this, connecting
with these people,

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
have been one of the
greatest assets we've had,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:84%
since getting our
geneticist two years ago.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is how slowly
we find mainstream scientists

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:84%
with the cajones to
do this kind of work,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to put their
reputations on the line.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're very careful,
they have to be, you know,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:84%
to not let people know
exactly what is going on.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So as we took it in, it
was just call the hominid.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Just the hominid,
so that everyone

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
could pretend that it
wasn't something else.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.765 align:middle line:84%
But they're young guys,
they are young people

00:14:55.765 --> 00:14:56.640 align:middle line:90%
running these things.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.943 align:middle line:84%
And you put it in there,
and they're like, whoa!

00:14:58.943 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:90%
You know, they know what it is.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I love it.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.033 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some more of
your questions, out there.

00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:04.377 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:04.377 --> 00:15:07.002 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could elaborate on what you

00:15:07.002 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
meant by Earth being physically
moved from the center

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:90%
of the universe?

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, who
moved it, Lloyd?

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Well, it was Copernicus
and Kepler and Galileo.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And what they found, over time,
was that the Earth-- you know,

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:84%
500 years ago, people
believed the Earth was

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.436 align:middle line:84%
the center of everything,
and everything

00:15:26.436 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
spun around the Earth.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And what those guys
did was, gradually

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:84%
show and then prove
that the Earth actually

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.629 align:middle line:84%
was moving around the
sun, and that everything

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:90%
was moving around the universe.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And it was just a shock.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you grew up
every day of your life

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.415 align:middle line:84%
believing that the Earth was
it, the center of everything,

00:15:46.415 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and you find out it's
just a very minor part

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
of a much more gigantic
scheme of life, that

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:90%
is a big, big mental shift.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And so what we are
trying to do now,

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
is move humanity from
the biological center

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, which is what
the mainstream and everybody

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:84%
else wants to keep us
as, because it's simple.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:90%
It's clean.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And nobody has to really worry
about what might be out there.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And to find out 500 years
ago that the Earth was moving

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and all of this, bad
things could happen.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
frightening for people

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
to absorb that and then get
used to the idea that, well, OK,

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:90%
it may happen.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't happening today.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.272 align:middle line:90%
So that kind of thing.

00:16:26.272 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Lloyd, is it possible
that we had a race of human

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
beings on this planet a long
time ago who looked like alien

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
greys, who had the big skulls,
the big eyes, and very skinny,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:90%
four feet?

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: I don't think
there were a race.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that greys have
lived here, in that sense.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:90%
I think the coneheads have.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think the
coneheads are human, either.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
The coneheads,
everybody should know,

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
who have seen pictures
of those skulls

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
with the giant
heads in the rear,

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.966 align:middle line:84%
they have brains that are,
on average, between 2,500

00:16:58.966 --> 00:17:01.265 align:middle line:90%
and 3,000 cubic centimeters.

00:17:01.265 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Huge.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Now you and I
have 1,400, on average--

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:90%
a little more, a little less.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Probably a
little less, for me.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: I would vote
against that, but maybe.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.060 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I think we,
all of us in this room,

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
would be in the
range of about 1,400.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you're having that, you're
having twice as much brain.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's very clear from x-rays
the brains fill the heads.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no tie in--
and what you'll

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:84%
hear the mainstream say is,
oh, those were just head bound.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Those were just bound
heads, and that was it.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, binding a head doesn't
double the brain capacity.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:90%
It's such a simple answer.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.888 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Binding the head doesn't
double the brain capacity.

00:17:40.888 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet, somehow, the
mainstream gets away

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
with that very
facile explanation,

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of like they try to
get away with the Starchild,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
with the cradleboarding
and hydocephalie.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's just Occam's razor.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.775 align:middle line:84%
Well, the simple answer
is the right one.

00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:58.644 align:middle line:84%
And we can come up with
this simple answer,

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:84%
so that's got to
be the right one.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, you're right.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
You might be able to
elongate the skull,

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:84%
but you're not going
to elongate the brain.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.134 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
create more brain

00:18:07.134 --> 00:18:08.800 align:middle line:84%
than you didn't have
when you were born.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.258 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: All you have to do is
look on Google Images and see

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:84%
some heads of humans that were
bound to look like the gods,

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and their heads, or their brain,
it's just a reshaped human

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:90%
head.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You put that up
against a conehead,

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:90%
and it's just a huge overlap.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And also, a human head that's
bound shows distinctive marks.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Just like the, as I was
saying, the cradleboarding,

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
the flattening of
it, very smooth.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
It shows distinctive marks of
whatever you do to flatten it,

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:84%
whether it's boards or cloth
or twine or whatever it is.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:90%
It shapes the bone.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It leaves impressions on
soft bone of the child.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
You look at the conehead
skulls, they are lumpy,

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:84%
they have their
natural convolutions,

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:90%
just like the Starchild does.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where do
you keep this thing?

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Well, normally we keep
it locked in a bank vault.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And very seldom bring it out
to show it in public, because

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:84%
of the various difficulties
and dangers of that.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But also, can't fly
with it or anything

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.455 align:middle line:84%
to have it risk
being confiscated.

00:19:10.455 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It would.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, it would be.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of
fact, Homeland Security

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:18.465 align:middle line:84%
just confiscated some dinosaur
bones several weeks ago.

00:19:18.465 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: No, we've been warned,
very clearly from sometime back

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that it's illegal without
all kinds of clearances from

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:84%
the highest level and
Homeland Security.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.514 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now why would they
be so concerned about that?

00:19:30.514 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: I don't really know.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't give reasons,
they just make rules

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and then the bureaucrats
carry them out.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When
you see the skull,

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.525 align:middle line:84%
does it have any
special meaning to you?

00:19:45.525 --> 00:19:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel different?

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there, yeah,
you're looking at a skull

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.650 align:middle line:84%
that you believe might be
extraterrestrial in origin.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:84%
That's got to be
kind of powerful.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: It is, at
first, it really is.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:84%
After 14 years, you have
to get a little jaded.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But even now, still,
when I show it

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:84%
to people-- I showed
it to some people

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
here earlier-- to see their
thrill at seeing it, feeling

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
it, holding it, touching it,
and knowing what it might be,

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:90%
you feed off that energy.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And I never get
really tired of that.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
thrill to see people

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
react to how it looks,
compared to the human.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:84%
How it feels,
compared to the human.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.195 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:20:25.195 --> 00:20:26.342 align:middle line:90%
It really is, you'll see.

00:20:26.342 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Of course, now
there were no remnants

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
crashed, retrieved,

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:90%
anything by the skull, right?

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: 900 years
ago, no, nothing.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Just the body in the mine
tunnel, according to the woman,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:90%
as she found the two bodies.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty
clear that the woman

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:84%
who brought the Starchild
to bury it there,

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.595 align:middle line:84%
had made some effort
to get it away

00:20:50.595 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:84%
into the middle of
nowhere civilization.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Because the girl,
when she found it,

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.854 align:middle line:84%
she was hiking well
away from civilization.

00:20:57.854 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's how she found it.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So there was some effort made
to hide it, for whatever reason.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.781 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there any evidence
that would show that it could

00:21:03.781 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:84%
be part of android, a mixture of
organic material and machinery?

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: This is one of
the things we were trying

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to determine with that
scan, George, at Stanford.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
we're looking at

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:90%
is, can the fibers be isolated?

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And if they can, what
are they made of?

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Because, you might remember
in Philip Corso's book,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that he said was

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:31.485 align:middle line:84%
that they were, greys were
part human and part biological,

00:21:31.485 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:84%
not human-- biological in
part, not non-biological.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
we want to determine

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.986 align:middle line:84%
is, are those fibers
of that nature?

00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Because they're very, very
durable-- very durable .

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.943 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, I
really believe, Lloyd,

00:21:44.943 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
if you were to go on
exhibit with the skull,

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:84%
you would get thousands of
people from various cities,

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
depending on what city you were
in, that would come and tour,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:90%
just to see that.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Well, we took it to
the Roswell 60th Anniversary,

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:84%
in 2007, and there were a lot of
problems that had to be solved,

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
in terms of security just
to put it at the UFO Museum

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.910 align:middle line:84%
in Roswell, and keep it there
and keep it safe for those four

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We did have about 3,000
people come through

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.260 align:middle line:90%
and take a look at it.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:84%
But that was a free
look, so we don't

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.130 align:middle line:84%
know if people would pay
to do it, or whatever.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
But we're not really in it
to make money, in that sense.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.212 align:middle line:84%
What we're into is to find
out what it is, for sure.

00:22:31.212 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're after
the science, aren't you?

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: We're after the science,
and we're after the proof.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Because as I always
say to Ray and Melanie,

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.830 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
how long we have

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to be poor, if this is the
real deal, we'll end up rich.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:84%
If it's not, then
we don't really

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:84%
deserve any more than we
gave it a good effort.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
But we've known for some
time now it's going to work.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:90%
We've known what it was.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And now that we're
getting-- really,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:84%
the wait, George, the 14
years, has really just

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:84%
been for the
technology of the time

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
to catch up with what's
needed to determine alien DNA.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:10.061 align:middle line:84%
Because the DNA analysis, up
till just a few years ago,

00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
was all done with
primers, where you

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
had to know what you
were starting with

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:90%
to go looking for it.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Now it doesn't matter.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:84%
If it's made out of nucleotides,
if it's made out of base pairs,

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.830 align:middle line:84%
if it's made out of DNA, doesn't
matter what, they can tell you

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
what it is and you can
compare it to other things.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So now the technology is
there, we can do this.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Really, now, it's
a matter of money.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have access
to the kind of money

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that we need through
the mainstream,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.970 align:middle line:84%
because the mainstream
keeps that for themselves,

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and they don't let
people like us access it.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Yeah, it's just
not the way it works.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you imagine
how lonely it must have been,

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:84%
if this, indeed, was an ET
who crashed his saucer on this

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:90%
planet?

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: And survived it.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.513 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And survived
it, just to be alone,

00:23:56.513 --> 00:23:59.160 align:middle line:90%
taken in by this woman.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:90%
It must have been amazing.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: It's an incredible story
if you spin it out like that.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:09.600 align:middle line:84%
We can only go by the end
of their relationship, which

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
shows a very strong link, a
very strong emotional bond

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:84%
between the two of
them, in some way.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is, we have

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.367 align:middle line:84%
serious doubts that the
Starchild could have talked.

00:24:22.367 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Aha.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.824 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: This is another
reason why, we think,

00:24:24.824 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:90%
it probably was a grey.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It is completely and entirely
missing its frontal sinuses.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Entirely, not even
vestiges, which,

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:84%
normally if you
have flawed sinuses,

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:84%
you've got something your
body attempts to grow.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And what your sinuses are for
is making your voice resonate.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you don't
have sinuses at all,

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.061 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING WITH A SQUEAKY VOICE)
you might sound like a robot,

00:24:46.061 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: (HIGH PITCHED) Could
you imagine me doing radio

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.210 align:middle line:90%
without a sinus?

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Exactly,
it wouldn't work.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:90%
So you have that factor.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:57.070 align:middle line:84%
You also have a huge
brain in that head.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
The same skull size that
holds 1,200 cubic centimeters,

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:84%
the human found with it, the
Starchild, when the brain

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:84%
guy was looking at it,
he said, well, it's

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.689 align:middle line:90%
going to be about 1,200.

00:25:07.689 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Looks about same size.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
1600 cubic centimeters
of brain in that skull.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really know
how to explain that.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Huge extra, fully 1/3 more.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.862 align:middle line:90%
So big brain.

00:25:19.862 --> 00:25:21.092 align:middle line:90%
A very tiny neck.

00:25:21.092 --> 00:25:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mm, hm.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Your neck, my neck
about 14 inches, right?

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 17.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: 17, OK. but
average is about 14.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.677 align:middle line:90%
My wrist is seven inches.

00:25:28.677 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's 14, you can tell.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: It's about that size.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:90%
The neck is very, very small.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which is a
typical alien grey.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: And on top of
that, its mouth is very,

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
very tiny from the maxilla that
we have, the maxilla piece.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.756 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like a slit?

00:25:41.756 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Very, very
tiny, and a flat roof.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So the tongue in there, it
ate, its teeth have wear,

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:90%
it was eating.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And its body shows
it was eating.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It still has
teeth in the skull?

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:90%
We'll see that?

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: No, no.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:90%
You won't see that now.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.769 align:middle line:90%
The maxilla is separated.

00:25:55.769 --> 00:25:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: But nonetheless, the
tongue, to fit in that mouth,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
has to be like the size
of a piece of cardboard,

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.716 align:middle line:90%
just for flipping food back.

00:26:04.716 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't be like for us.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:90%
So you've got no sinuses.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:90%
You've got no talking tongue.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:90%
You've got a very small neck.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So we assume that it
communicated like a grey,

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
which everybody
says is telepathic.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.005 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does it
have an ear canal?

00:26:19.005 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Yes, it does
have an ear canal,

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and it has inner ears that are
twice the size of our inner

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:90%
ears.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But we think that has
to do with the balancing

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:84%
mechanism required
for that neck,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:84%
because the head is
much bigger than ours.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's balanced--
where the spine comes

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:84%
into the skull has
been moved forward,

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:84%
directly underneath,
so that you've

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:90%
got as much here as you do here.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's balanced
this way and it's

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:84%
balanced that way
on that little neck.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Now the importance
of that is, if you

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.865 align:middle line:84%
take a baseball
bat, for example,

00:26:50.865 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and hold it down at
the bottom, and hold

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:84%
it vertical straight up
with the barrel up here

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and absolutely straight
out, you can hold it

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't feel
heavy, all right.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: You tilt it one degree,
two degrees, three degrees.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Then you
start feeling it.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Absolutely.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So its head had to stay
on that neck right.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And we think the bigger
inner ears probably

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.167 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the
balancing of that big head

00:27:15.167 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:90%
on that little neck.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's amazing.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.518 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be back.

00:27:17.518 --> 00:27:20.350 align:middle line:84%
More with Lloyd Pye on
"Beyond Belief," standby.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:25.584 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:25.584 --> 00:27:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:84%
We've got Lloyd
Pye, here, who is

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:90%
traveling with the Starchild.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you show it to people,
what's their reaction to this?

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: It's pretty much like
it was this morning when I got

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Just, whoa!

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:84%
It is, it's an awesome,
awesome experience

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
to see it and hold it and
imagine that this really is

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.360 align:middle line:84%
the skull of an alien that
lived and existed on this planet

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and died here and was
buried here 900 years ago.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:84%
When that reality begins to
sink in, it's a powerful moment,

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:02.390 align:middle line:90%
it's a powerful experience.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's something
that will stick with everyone

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.600 align:middle line:90%
that gets that experience.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.599 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, we've
sometimes talked about

00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:10.302 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that
Earth is a prison planet.

00:28:10.302 --> 00:28:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Oh, yeah.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.885 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That those
that are on this planet,

00:28:12.885 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:84%
those that have been on this
planet were dumped here from

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.950 align:middle line:84%
other civilizations
and other worlds.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.510 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't
want them around.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having
prisons on their planet,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:90%
they dumped them here.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Right.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What are the
possibilities that this

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:31.600 align:middle line:84%
project, that this Starchild
could have been somebody from

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:84%
a different planet
that they just said,

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get rid of you,
you're going to planet Earth,

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and they dumped him here?

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: It's hard to
imagine, but maybe.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's possible.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: It may be possible.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he was just a
complete renegade.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.559 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Billy the Kid
of his place, or something.

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, I mean, we don't
know his personality, right?

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: We don't know.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:90%
We don't know, that's right.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can we determine
whether it was male or female,

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:90%
for sure?

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: With the
full genome, yes.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:90%
We can determine that.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:84%
We can determine the
chromosome count.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:84%
We can determine everything
with a full genome.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But understand, we're
talking about three

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:84%
plus billion, more or less,
you know, humans, chimps,

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.490 align:middle line:84%
everything is in the three
billion base pair range.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And we have now, oh, maybe
50 million base pairs.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Which is quite a lot.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Tells you an awful lot.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.596 align:middle line:84%
You can extrapolate a lot
of knowledge from that.

00:29:21.596 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But we still have
a very long way

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:90%
to go to get the whole genome.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could
it be part animal?

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:26.775 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: No.

00:29:26.775 --> 00:29:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not at all?

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: No.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:84%
You can look at it and see,
it's something very, very

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:84%
different than human, but it
is human-like, human-like.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.411 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Lloyd, give me your
views on extraterrestrial life

00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've always said that
the primordial soup, that which

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
has made us, is all
over the universe.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
reason to conclude

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.240 align:middle line:84%
that civilizations
aren't everywhere.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Right.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.140 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I have written a book, an ebook
about it, and another book

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.300 align:middle line:84%
about it, the
"Intervention Theory."

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is a large
community of other beings

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.520 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Earth, itself, has

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.610 align:middle line:90%
been terraformed from day one.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Because, the
reality of space is,

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.900 align:middle line:84%
if you have a seething
ball of magma,

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:84%
just swizzling
through space, that's

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
just going to turn
into a dry, dead rock.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Things have to happen to turn
that dry dead rock into earth,

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.810 align:middle line:84%
like something like Earth,
where it has oxygen, where

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
it has a UV shield, an ozone
layer, where it has water,

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.245 align:middle line:90%
where it has all of that.

00:30:37.245 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:90%
That takes work.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And it takes work over
billions of years.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Somebody looked at Earth 4
and 1/2 billion years ago,

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.420 align:middle line:84%
4 billion years ago,
said, this is the place.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And they began to do the
things that need to be done.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And I go over this in detail in
my "Intervention Theory" ebook.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it
said that you have

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.420 align:middle line:84%
to bring a certain kind of
life form, the prokaryotes, two

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.400 align:middle line:90%
kinds.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
get here at around 4

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:84%
billion years ago, which
tie up the free iron,

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.910 align:middle line:84%
which you can't have any
free iron because you

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:90%
won't have oxygen.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Oxygen reacts very
actively with iron.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:90%
You do that.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:15.630 align:middle line:90%
You tie up the iron.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.250 align:middle line:84%
We have the banded
iron formations

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.710 align:middle line:90%
to show that that happened.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you have free
oxygen getting out there,

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:90%
you have to do other things.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.507 align:middle line:84%
You have to create
an ozone layer,

00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:84%
because you can't have
life on the surface of land

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.210 align:middle line:84%
or the surface of the
sea without that there.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.750 align:middle line:84%
All the things that
have to happen,

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:middle line:90%
happen when they have to happen.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, I see it as
is Intervention Theory

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.770 align:middle line:84%
by terraformers from the
beginning, on this planet.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that all of it is
going to prove out in the end.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be part of
a very large galactic community

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that extends back for many,
many billions of years.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there anything in
the skull that would allow us

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.622 align:middle line:90%
to clone it one day?

00:31:56.622 --> 00:32:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Yes, one day,
but not any time soon.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:90%
They're working on it.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Everybody works on it.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.164 align:middle line:84%
They want to clone dinosaurs,
they want to clone the mammoth.

00:32:05.164 --> 00:32:06.080 align:middle line:90%
They're working on it.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.371 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's clone a little
ET and see what happens.

00:32:08.371 --> 00:32:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: And the Starchild's
DNA, as it happens,

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.950 align:middle line:84%
because it was in a mine
tunnel, is very well preserved.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.340 align:middle line:90%
900 years ago, in a mine tunnel.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Now understand, when you
die, it doesn't matter,

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:84%
after 50 years in the best
of circumstances, everything

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.340 align:middle line:90%
breaks down into little pieces.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is the challenge
of recovering ancient DNA.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:90%
There's living DNA.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:84%
If you and I get our
genome tested now,

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:84%
$10,000 and we're in,
because it's live.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.562 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, if you will,
Christmas lights, you

00:32:37.562 --> 00:32:39.770 align:middle line:84%
know the big wad of Christmas
lights, and the lights,

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and the green cord
between it, all that.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that as the genes
that work and the junk DNA.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine all that.

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you get that
box of Christmas lights

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:90%
and you give it to the machine.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:84%
If it's live, they can
just, [WHISTLE] undo it,

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.489 align:middle line:84%
just like we have
to do it, slowly,

00:32:55.489 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and those machines can just
stretch them out and do it,

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:84%
no problem-- the
next-generation sequencers.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:84%
But with long dead DNA, with
ancient DNA, take the string,

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.140 align:middle line:84%
put it through a wood
chipper and then give it

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:90%
to the machine.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.164 align:middle line:90%
The machine can still do it.

00:33:10.164 --> 00:33:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: But it takes an
awful lot more effort.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why are we so obsessed
with trying to determine

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:90%
our origins?

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: I think we
know, at some level,

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that there's a really
interesting story behind it,

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:90%
because we don't fit this place.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't fit with
anything else here.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:90%
We're radically different.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all
know, at some level,

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.220 align:middle line:84%
no matter what our position,
no matter what our training,

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:84%
we know we're not really a
good fit with this place.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We're not good,
you know, we're not

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:90%
good managers of the planet.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.770 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong there.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back,
and you look back

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.650 align:middle line:84%
to the beginning of
it, I think we all

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.225 align:middle line:84%
recognize there has to be
a really fascinating story.

00:33:53.225 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of things
that keeps me going.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know how
that happened and why.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, I
believe in a higher power.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm very spiritual,
as you are, too.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But that question is
just always on my mind.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:08.920 align:middle line:90%
You know, how did we get here?

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:90%
What does it all mean?

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the answer is,
indeed, with the Starchild.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: I think the
Starchild can provide,

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and very likely will provide,
the opening wedge that will

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:28.090 align:middle line:84%
allow a whole generation of new
scientists to come in and start

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:31.420 align:middle line:84%
actively looking for those
answers that you're seeking,

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that I'm seeking, that
everybody here would be seeking.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Something has to
provide the leverage

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to allow mainstream
scientists to do this work.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I know, I'm out there
with them, they want to,

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.590 align:middle line:84%
but they're
absolutely terrorized

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.570 align:middle line:84%
by what their conservative
peers will do to them if it's

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:84%
known that they are seeking
these kinds of answers.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.370 align:middle line:84%
That they're
helping to determine

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.140 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of answers.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream that's in charge,
is in charge to do one thing,

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.670 align:middle line:90%
keep things the way they are.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.295 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right

00:35:05.295 --> 00:35:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: No big
changes on my watch.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:90%
On my watch, no big changes.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't care when I'm
retired, I don't care.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.973 align:middle line:90%
But on my watch, no big changes.

00:35:12.973 --> 00:35:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You'll never retire.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Is there a Nobel Prize for
science, for some scientist who

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.440 align:middle line:90%
helps you unravel this mystery?

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Very likely.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:24.880 align:middle line:90%
At some point, very likely.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't say that to them,
but I think it's a given.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.223 align:middle line:84%
I won't get it, but
one of them could.

00:35:30.223 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
what a discovery.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: It is.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.145 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
discoveries in human history

00:35:34.145 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:84%
is sitting right
there, and we're

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.367 align:middle line:84%
going to have it on
your desk in a minute.

00:35:37.367 --> 00:35:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Lloyd, tell us a
little bit about where people

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.899 align:middle line:84%
can get more information on
you and the Starchild Project.

00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Just real simple.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
The starchildproject.com
website.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have a personal website
lloydpye.com, L-l-o-y-d P-y-e.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And people can start from there.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:55.380 align:middle line:90%
I have books.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.620 align:middle line:90%
I have ebooks.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend
the ebooks first,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.890 align:middle line:84%
as sort of getting into it,
and then the larger books,

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.830 align:middle line:84%
if you want to go
from that point.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And those are easy to find
and locate on the website.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So it starchildproject.com,
lloydpye.com, simple dimple.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you first
looked at the skull yourself,

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:90%
what did you think?

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: I have to
be honest with you,

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I really felt that it was
some kind of human deformity.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But I also knew
enough about skulls

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.050 align:middle line:84%
to know that it was
radically different.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But it was, that moment,
was like the guy discovering

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:84%
the Dead Sea Scrolls,
or something like that.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.502 align:middle line:84%
You can't believe the
lightening bolt has struck you.

00:36:35.502 --> 00:36:37.100 align:middle line:90%
You can't make yourself believe.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you're there,
you're looking at it.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.270 align:middle line:90%
You're touching it.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.429 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: And there's
Melanie saying--

00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:84%
she's had it for a few
months now-- she's saying,

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a grey.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.512 align:middle line:90%
I've really looked.

00:36:45.512 --> 00:36:46.470 align:middle line:90%
I've really researched.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.303 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a grey.

00:36:47.303 --> 00:36:48.590 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it's really weird,
but I can't believe that

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.780 align:middle line:90%
it's a grey.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Now I do believe that it is.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And it took me about a
year to convince myself

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.180 align:middle line:90%
that it was legitimate.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But that first
look into those eye

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:84%
sockets-- my dad was an
optometrists for a long time,

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I really know about eyes-- and
when I saw those eye sockets,

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.395 align:middle line:84%
I knew that was
radically different.

00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Radically different.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The big look, yeah.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: The one thing
I knew was that.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.885 align:middle line:84%
And when you flip it over and
you see the inion missing,

00:37:16.885 --> 00:37:19.860 align:middle line:84%
you know that, too, is a
real radical difference.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was just saying, it has
to be some kind of combination

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:27.000 align:middle line:84%
here, because I
can't yet believe

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm holding an alien
skull in my hands.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:90%
She says, you'll get used to it.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.920 align:middle line:90%
And she was right.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.420 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and if it is
projected to be about four feet

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.560 align:middle line:84%
tall, there's no way it could
have been a little baby, then,

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: No.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not a baby.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:43.330 align:middle line:90%
And also, the wear of the teeth.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Starchild was a misnomer.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:45.419 align:middle line:90%
It was a mistake.

00:37:45.419 --> 00:37:47.960 align:middle line:84%
The guy that took-- the first
thing we did was we had x-rays,

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and he saw the
teeth and he x-rayed

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:84%
the bone, the peace of maxilla,
it's this part of your mouth,

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:90%
right here, up here.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:90%
And it has this bone.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.405 align:middle line:90%
And it had five crowns up here.

00:37:57.405 --> 00:37:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the
two teeth down,

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.520 align:middle line:84%
the three missing holes,
and the five crowns.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, OK,
teeth down, teeth up,

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:05.630 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be a child
five or six years old.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So it ended up being
called the Starchild

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:12.180 align:middle line:84%
before we knew that the
teeth were so heavily worn.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.617 align:middle line:90%
No child could have done that.

00:38:13.617 --> 00:38:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Excellent.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: It was at least in its
20's, and could have been 500

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:21.030 align:middle line:84%
years, if it was the
kind of being that,

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.940 align:middle line:84%
when it lost its teeth,
it just grew more,

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.982 align:middle line:90%
like a shark or whatever.

00:38:23.982 --> 00:38:24.815 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:38:24.815 --> 00:38:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Lloyd, let's take
some more questions

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:90%
from our audience for you.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot of
folks out there interested.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to somebody here.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you sir, way in the back.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I wonder,
as I sit here listening,

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.856 align:middle line:84%
I just came off of
a graveyard shift,

00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and I listen to a
lot of people talk.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering, as
you're driving down the road

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're thinking about the
different people you've talk

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to, what do you think the
reaction of the mainstream

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.380 align:middle line:84%
religions of the
world are going to be

00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.317 align:middle line:90%
when you have absolute proof?

00:39:00.317 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a great question.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: It is.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.851 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What does
mainstream religion do?

00:39:03.851 --> 00:39:06.140 align:middle line:84%
If you came out
today and said, we

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.080 align:middle line:84%
know, beyond a
shadow of a doubt,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that this is an
extraterrestrial being that

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
died here 900 some years
ago, however it got here,

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.870 align:middle line:84%
what do you think mainstream
religion will say?

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:20.730 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic Church has
already gone on record

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.400 align:middle line:84%
as saying that belief
in extraterrestrial life

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.270 align:middle line:84%
does not negate
your belief in God.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But what do you
think they would say?

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: I think it
will be the same thing.

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to some,
and I ask them,

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.550 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
the reaction will be,

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.870 align:middle line:84%
because I have to be
prepared to deal with that?

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And all they tell me is,
all we're going to say

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.630 align:middle line:84%
is that it just means God has a
wider reach and a wider grasp,

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and nothing, really,
is going to change.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think religion
is going to change.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.793 align:middle line:84%
I really don't think
government's going to change.

00:39:49.793 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:84%
The only people that are
really going to take a lick

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.690 align:middle line:90%
here is mainstream science.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:90%
They will have a big black eye.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.820 align:middle line:90%
It will last for a few years.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll just
go back to normal.

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, they'll end up
taking credit for it,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.410 align:middle line:84%
we knew it all along,
something like that.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll just go on
and it'll be in their hands,

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.300 align:middle line:90%
not in our hands.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, our job
is to get it to that point,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.860 align:middle line:84%
to get them to the tipping
point where they're not afraid

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and they're not cowed by their
very conservative leaders

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and those among them who
are very conservative, just

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.520 align:middle line:90%
to get it going.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So that at least some of
them can work on it actively

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:25.850 align:middle line:90%
and openly.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.344 align:middle line:90%
You know Otzi, the Iceman.

00:40:27.344 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: OK, imagine that the
Starchild will be the Otzi

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:90%
the Iceman of the future.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Every test conceivable
will be run on that thing,

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.932 align:middle line:84%
once it's OK and safe
for scientists to do it.

00:40:39.932 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do you
think the masses will do,

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.480 align:middle line:84%
if this is announced
that it's an ET?

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Will they go crazy?

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Will societies break down?

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: No.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.590 align:middle line:84%
They'll just get up and go
to work the next day, like--

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And talk about
it at the water cooler.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: It will just be a
different day, but, you know,

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.691 align:middle line:90%
same stuff.

00:40:58.691 --> 00:40:59.523 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Who's got another
question for Lloyd Pye,

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:90%
here, on "Beyond Belief"?

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.865 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:41:04.865 --> 00:41:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I was just curious
if you have recovered any other

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.320 align:middle line:84%
skeletal fragments from the mine
shaft site where it was found

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:10.820 align:middle line:90%
at?

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And also, in line
with the teeth,

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:84%
did they seem to resemble
human teeth, the same form

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.090 align:middle line:90%
and function?

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Or were they just kind
of the same thing,

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.300 align:middle line:90%
close, but not quite right?

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: The teeth were
essentially the same.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.510 align:middle line:84%
No distinctive difference,
except much smaller.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Much smaller and much
harder, it seems like.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.670 align:middle line:84%
As far as any other
post cranial bones, no.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:38.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know where the
mine tunnel was, exactly.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
The woman, when
she was dying, she

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:84%
was passing the
skulls on like you

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.000 align:middle line:84%
would try to find
a home for a pet.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.320 align:middle line:84%
She and her husband had
kept them in a cardboard box

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.440 align:middle line:90%
for like 60 years, almost.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And then it had gone
on to another couple.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.560 align:middle line:90%
They kept it for five years.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And then they passed it
on to Ray and Melanie.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.260 align:middle line:84%
People can be uncomfortable
with skulls in a cardboard box

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.350 align:middle line:90%
in their garage.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So because Melanie had
been a neonatal nurse,

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:90%
they were given to them.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But Ray and Melanie don't know
the name of the first couple.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.220 align:middle line:84%
They kind of just didn't
want to be involved in it.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it's been.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.287 align:middle line:84%
It belongs to Ray and
Melanie, and that's it.

00:42:16.287 --> 00:42:17.870 align:middle line:84%
The other couples
were not interested.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what about
other fragments by it?

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:19.881 align:middle line:90%
Nothing, huh?

00:42:19.881 --> 00:42:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: No, just
the skull itself,

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and the detached piece of
maxilla that I've told you.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:27.440 align:middle line:84%
That was all that
was there in the box.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a long story.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.879 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the books
that I've written.

00:42:30.879 --> 00:42:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to plug
them, but I'm just saying,

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:84%
the story is there
of how she got--

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.310 align:middle line:84%
she tried to recover
the full skeletons.

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:39.250 align:middle line:90%
She lost most of the bones.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a fairly dramatic story.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.560 align:middle line:84%
They were caught
in a flood, they

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.300 align:middle line:90%
tumbled down a long stream.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.610 align:middle line:84%
She went looking and all she
found was the damaged skulls.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:52.120 align:middle line:84%
The human has lost one of
its zygomatic arches, one

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.370 align:middle line:90%
of its cheekbones.

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Starchild lost a
part of its lower face,

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.070 align:middle line:84%
both of its zygomatic
arches, and the left half

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:01.050 align:middle line:90%
of its maxilla.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take one
more question for Lloyd.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:04.520 align:middle line:90%
What do we have?

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.929 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:43:05.929 --> 00:43:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
there's going to be a tipping

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:09.330 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:12.330 align:middle line:84%
In your mind, what is that
tipping point going to be?

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:19.070 align:middle line:84%
What test is it going to be
that gives the scientific world

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.940 align:middle line:84%
the go ahead to say, OK,
this is something different?

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: The tipping point
has to be, can only be,

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.330 align:middle line:90%
the full genome.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything else,
everything else-- and I've

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:33.240 align:middle line:84%
tried everything--
the mainstream just

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.470 align:middle line:84%
says, oh, nature
can do anything.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you stack
up 10,000 differences,

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:38.700 align:middle line:90%
nature can do anything.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.880 align:middle line:84%
The one thing nature can't
do is fiddle with DNA,

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.352 align:middle line:84%
because DNA is the
math of biology.

00:43:44.352 --> 00:43:45.185 align:middle line:90%
It's like a formula.

00:43:45.185 --> 00:43:48.280 align:middle line:84%
It says the same thing
every time, every time.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.800 align:middle line:90%
So they can't fiddle with it.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.610 align:middle line:90%
They can't just write it off.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So when we have that
full genome lined up

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.750 align:middle line:90%
against a human genome.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And it says it's 300%
different, or 500% difference--

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.530 align:middle line:84%
right now, very
early in-- we think

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.940 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
around 700% different.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.890 align:middle line:90%
700% different.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But wherever it is, it's going
to be so different that you

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:13.930 align:middle line:84%
can't be -- you can't even begin
to say it's anything related

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:14.910 align:middle line:90%
to human.

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Because a chimp is 3%
different, a gorilla

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.340 align:middle line:90%
is 5% different, a rat 70%.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.051 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:44:23.051 --> 00:44:23.550 align:middle line:90%
700%?

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, this is huge.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Lloyd, we're going to come
back and look at the Starchild

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.899 align:middle line:84%
in just a moment,
on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:30.899 --> 00:44:34.392 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:34.392 --> 00:44:37.484 align:middle line:90%


00:44:37.484 --> 00:44:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.930 align:middle line:84%
We've got the
Starchild skull here

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:47.870 align:middle line:84%
with representations of
human skulls and others.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:50.940 align:middle line:90%
A brain-type looks, too.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Brain casts.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The casts for the
brains, they look so small.

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Are these actual
human-sized brains?

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: That is the size of--
this is actually the same size

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.690 align:middle line:84%
as this, which, oh, I'm sorry,
which is a 12-year-old girl,

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:90%
about five feet tall, again.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have, to match,
that's the same size there,

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:12.702 align:middle line:90%
same size here, same size here.

00:45:12.702 --> 00:45:13.535 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:45:13.535 --> 00:45:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let you
explain all these, Lloyd.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: This is the human skull,
the human female that was found

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.140 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I want you, since
you've never done this,

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:22.390 align:middle line:90%
and I know you haven't.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I have never.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:23.605 align:middle line:90%
>> NARRATOR: Hold it.

00:45:23.605 --> 00:45:24.312 align:middle line:90%
Now just feel--

00:45:24.312 --> 00:45:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've talked with you
for more than 10 years about

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:28.267 align:middle line:90%
this, and here she is.

00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Here she is.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Get a sense of her
weight and her feel.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Now put her down.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Normal, human skull.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.715 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Normal human skull.

00:45:35.715 --> 00:45:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And feel this and
tell us your reaction.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This is like a
balloon next to it-- very light,

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:90%
very light.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.509 align:middle line:84%
And this is it, this is
the actual Starchild skull.

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: This is the
actual Starchild skull.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.154 align:middle line:90%
You can see the--

00:45:48.154 --> 00:45:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Notice the
eyes, how close they are,

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and how huge they are?

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: No, actually,
if you look,

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.047 align:middle line:84%
the eyes are no
closer than that.

00:45:53.047 --> 00:45:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They seem to be.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.338 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: What's different,
they're a different design,

00:45:56.338 --> 00:45:57.260 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:90%
We have brow ridges.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:84%
The Starchild has
no brow ridges.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Our nose comes down in a
dip off our brow ridge.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.670 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, that
it's absolutely flat.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Our nose slopes down, like that.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.290 align:middle line:84%
The Starchild's nose seems to
stay flat the whole way down.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why is it's so light?

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Because, as you see
here, you look in the cuts,

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.050 align:middle line:90%
turn your cut around.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:21.184 align:middle line:84%
You see how thin the bone
is, relatively speaking.

00:46:21.184 --> 00:46:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: See how thin?

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.061 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And look
how thick that is.

00:46:24.061 --> 00:46:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: And the amazing thing
is, while it's much lighter,

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.380 align:middle line:90%
it's two to three times harder.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.514 align:middle line:84%
When you cut this-- and
I've cut it a few times

00:46:31.514 --> 00:46:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen other
people cut it,

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.745 align:middle line:84%
too-- if you want to cut
about a quarter of an inch

00:46:35.745 --> 00:46:38.250 align:middle line:84%
into a human bone,
into this, which

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.450 align:middle line:84%
is-- this is not
soft stuff, this

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.870 align:middle line:84%
is tough-- you take a
hand saw and you do it.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.950 align:middle line:84%
A small hand saw, you'll
go about 50 strokes

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.450 align:middle line:90%
to go a quarter of an inch.

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:49.660 align:middle line:84%
To go that same quarter of
an inch in the Starchild

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.770 align:middle line:90%
it takes about 200 strokes.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like cutting sheet
metal by comparison.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: And that's those
fibers and the great,

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.150 align:middle line:84%
great increased density
of the collagen in it.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:04.580 align:middle line:84%
The whole Starchild
bone is like the density

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.280 align:middle line:90%
or the toughness of your teeth.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.586 align:middle line:84%
Its chemistry reads out
like tooth enamel does,

00:47:09.586 --> 00:47:11.460 align:middle line:84%
like human tooth enamel,
which is the hardest

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.100 align:middle line:84%
bone in your body--
the whole head.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, even
if it were a deformity,

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:20.150 align:middle line:84%
it should still have the same
bone thickness as a human

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.740 align:middle line:90%
skull?

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Right.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And it doesn't.

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: No.

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:23.612 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You could tell.

00:47:23.612 --> 00:47:25.028 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: And if it
was a deformity,

00:47:25.028 --> 00:47:26.530 align:middle line:84%
it would have its
deformed parts.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, look, everyone can see
the difference in the thickness

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:90%
right there, just from the cuts.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:37.260 align:middle line:84%
But if it was a human, whatever
its deformity part was,

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:40.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, whatever is
left is going to be human.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:43.560 align:middle line:84%
There is no part
of this skull-- you

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.340 align:middle line:84%
take 25 major
points of reference

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
on a human skull-- there's not
a single match in the Starchild.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Not one, where you say
it's exactly the same.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.757 align:middle line:90%
Take me to your leader.

00:47:55.757 --> 00:47:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Well, actually,
the way it looks is,

00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:59.900 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the
bottom side of it.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.840 align:middle line:84%
This is its front
side, actually.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, sort of
looking at you.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Its neck would be under like
that, both front and rear.

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And you see the inion, the
knot we all have back here

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.310 align:middle line:84%
in the back of our head, you
can see and you can feel,

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:14.320 align:middle line:90%
that's a dent there.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:15.383 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: You with me?

00:48:15.383 --> 00:48:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Now let me show the
neck on a human,

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:20.430 align:middle line:84%
just real quick,
the neck on a human

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.590 align:middle line:90%
covers this whole area here.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.580 align:middle line:90%
This is it's inion here.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.560 align:middle line:84%
You can see where the
muscle attachments are.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Pretty good size.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.560 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
Starchild's neck,

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.890 align:middle line:84%
you see that radical
difference I was talking about.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Instead of here, it's
all the way down here,

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:39.820 align:middle line:84%
right on top of the
foramen, so that you've

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.110 align:middle line:84%
got this little bitty
neck underneath.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.847 align:middle line:84%
And it's sitting under there,
so it's like this and that.

00:48:45.847 --> 00:48:47.430 align:middle line:84%
All the things that
I was telling you.

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It would sit like
this, if it could,

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.730 align:middle line:84%
except it's just balanced
completely different.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I said that
it was moved forward,

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:56.060 align:middle line:84%
so you can't set it
up like you can this.

00:48:56.060 --> 00:49:00.325 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, Lloyd, I'm
trying to picture in my mind

00:49:00.325 --> 00:49:05.330 align:middle line:84%
a four foot tall alien like this
walking around on the planet.

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:07.437 align:middle line:90%
I mean, absolutely riveting.

00:49:07.437 --> 00:49:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: It is.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:08.550 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.091 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What else
did you bring us?

00:49:10.091 --> 00:49:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Well, I brought
a stereolithographic copy

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:13.850 align:middle line:90%
of a human, as you can see.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:17.269 align:middle line:84%
It's just, without the cuts,
it's complete and whole.

00:49:17.269 --> 00:49:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: And underneath
this paint job,

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.890 align:middle line:84%
this is the
Starchild copy, here.

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Stereolithographic with
all the cuts in place.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:84%
We had this made back
in '99, before we

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.330 align:middle line:90%
made the first cut on this.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Now the brain scans
are interesting,

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:34.850 align:middle line:90%
in that we just received them.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:37.079 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had these
made for your show.

00:49:37.079 --> 00:49:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: I had these
made for your show.

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.865 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: First time.

00:49:38.865 --> 00:49:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: First time.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And as you see, a
normal human skull

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:47.160 align:middle line:84%
has its normal convolutions
and you see how lumpy it is.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Starchild is
just completely smooth.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:52.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just completely smooth.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was at a conference
with a neuroscientist,

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.080 align:middle line:84%
a female neuroscientist,
and I asked her,

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.110 align:middle line:84%
would you please
take a look at these

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:03.990 align:middle line:90%
and tell me what you can see?

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And she made a very,
very interesting comment.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:10.630 align:middle line:84%
She said, this part
here, the frontal lobe

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.120 align:middle line:90%
is what makes us us.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It's what gives us our
emotions, our hatreds, our envy,

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.330 align:middle line:90%
our jealousy.

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:19.830 align:middle line:84%
She said this is actually
the worst part of us,

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:23.130 align:middle line:84%
the thing that makes us what
we are, but the things we wish,

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:25.020 align:middle line:90%
maybe, we didn't have.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And she said, look, it
doesn't have any of that.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a much cleaner copy
and a much cleaner model.

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Another thing she said--
there, let me hold on to this.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:34.868 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: She said,
it's fascinating.

00:50:34.868 --> 00:50:38.085 align:middle line:84%
You see how eye sockets
are two inches deep

00:50:38.085 --> 00:50:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and the foramens
are in the back?

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:44.450 align:middle line:84%
This Starchild's eyes are
not even a half inch deep.

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.130 align:middle line:90%
And the foramens are down here.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So she says, this eye can't
be an eye like we have.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.654 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:50:49.654 --> 00:50:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I've known that from
the very beginning.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It would be bugging
out like frog eyes.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:57.110 align:middle line:84%
You can't get a human eyeball
that would set out to here.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So she says, and
we've always thought,

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.270 align:middle line:90%
this eye is a non-moving eye.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're going to
get 180 degrees of vision,

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:09.380 align:middle line:84%
in a flat non-moving
eye, you're going

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:14.460 align:middle line:84%
to have to have a whole pupil,
all pupil, wall to wall, black.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.040 align:middle line:90%
All black eye.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that,
we see down a tunnel,

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.300 align:middle line:90%
and we have peripheral vision.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.900 align:middle line:90%
But we see down a tunnel.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have a certain amount
of brain power to handle that.

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And she said, if
you look at a human,

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:33.830 align:middle line:84%
oh, sorry, its visual cortex
is this area right in here.

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:35.910 align:middle line:84%
See the visual
cortex, right there?

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And without looking at
it, without looking at it,

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.410 align:middle line:84%
she looked at that and she
said, the visual cortex

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.930 align:middle line:84%
on that Starchild
with those weird eyes

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:45.290 align:middle line:90%
has got to be bigger.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And flipped it over and
she said, look at that.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Can you see that expansion
of that triangle?

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: She was right, yeah.

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Without even looking,
she knew that this expansion--

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:59.245 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what I was
looking at, either, at first.

00:51:59.245 --> 00:52:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But when she made
that statement,

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.720 align:middle line:84%
she says, it needs
more computing power

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.970 align:middle line:84%
if it's handling
nothing but pupil,

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.460 align:middle line:84%
scanning 180 degrees
all the time.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do we know it
wasn't like a camera lens?

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: We don't.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.510 align:middle line:90%
We really don't.

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:15.160 align:middle line:90%
We're just making assumptions.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.430 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a biological
entity, which we believe it is,

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:22.120 align:middle line:84%
then it has to-- all
biological entities

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.210 align:middle line:84%
have eyes that work
sort of in the same way

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:26.070 align:middle line:90%
that ours do, down to insects.

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:29.413 align:middle line:84%
So we just assume it has the
same kind of situation, just

00:52:29.413 --> 00:52:31.413 align:middle line:84%
a different, very different
eyeball than we have

00:52:31.413 --> 00:52:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and with very
different functions.

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:34.389 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, I've
got to tell you, Lloyd,

00:52:34.389 --> 00:52:36.832 align:middle line:90%
holding it is a weird feeling.

00:52:36.832 --> 00:52:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Isn't it?

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, just to
think that it's possible that

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.690 align:middle line:90%
it's an extraterrestrial.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:44.440 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.420 align:middle line:84%
What is this, right
here, these things?

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: These things are,
you can see them right here,

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.980 align:middle line:90%
you see this right here?

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Uh, huh.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.924 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: It protects the
maxilla from slamming back in.

00:52:53.924 --> 00:52:55.340 align:middle line:84%
You see these two
nobs right here,

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.670 align:middle line:84%
these two things you're
seeing right here?

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:middle line:84%
What these are are
just bracing bones,

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.520 align:middle line:90%
bracing bones for your maxilla.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So that if you get
hit in the face,

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:07.200 align:middle line:84%
your front teeth will not
jam back here and kill you.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Just that simple.

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Just that simple.

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And those little stobs that
you see off to the side,

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.150 align:middle line:90%
are the zygomatic arches.

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:16.645 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: But you see how
much flatter they are.

00:53:16.645 --> 00:53:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mm, hm.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:19.378 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: And so the Starchild
is going to have a very narrow

00:53:19.378 --> 00:53:21.070 align:middle line:90%
face compared to ours.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:24.546 align:middle line:84%
It has all the looks of a
grey, the heart-shaped face.

00:53:24.546 --> 00:53:26.480 align:middle line:90%
It has all of that.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's amazing to
me, too, as a human being,

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:35.407 align:middle line:84%
fully grown woman,
the skull seems small.

00:53:35.407 --> 00:53:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: It is small.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.730 align:middle line:90%
She was about five feet tall.

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:38.279 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:53:38.279 --> 00:53:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: She was
about five feet tall,

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.980 align:middle line:84%
which is standard for
Mexicans, even today.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you seen
bigger skulls in humans?

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:45.918 align:middle line:90%
>> PYE: Oh, yeah.

00:53:45.918 --> 00:53:48.914 align:middle line:84%
At Medical Modeling, where
we had this work done,

00:53:48.914 --> 00:53:50.080 align:middle line:90%
there were a number of them.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
the difference.

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What did the company
that created the model,

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.762 align:middle line:84%
the mold, what did
they think of this?

00:53:56.762 --> 00:53:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: They're right
here in Golden, Colorado,

00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Medical Modeling.

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:01.310 align:middle line:84%
You can go talk to
Andy Christensen

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:03.095 align:middle line:84%
and he'll tell you
about the process that

00:54:03.095 --> 00:54:03.970 align:middle line:90%
was involved in this.

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was he
shocked by this?

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: I think Andy's
like everyone else.

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:11.810 align:middle line:84%
He's really
interested, fascinated,

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for the evidence
to come in to verify it.

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I think, like most people,
he wants it to be that.

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But those who don't really
know that much about it

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:25.080 align:middle line:84%
in great detail
are waiting for us

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.970 align:middle line:90%
to provide the science to do it.

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Before you leave
this planet, Mr. Pye,

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:34.110 align:middle line:84%
how much do you want an
answer to this question?

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Well, I really
want just an answer.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.276 align:middle line:84%
And I do on it before I
leave the planet, hopefully.

00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going to
get it in the next few months,

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:42.180 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.280 align:middle line:90%
As soon as we're funded.

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And we just keep
pushing all the time.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I know 14 years sounds
like a long time,

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:52.140 align:middle line:84%
but there's enormous
resistance, enormous resistance.

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're just a very
small ragtag group

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.870 align:middle line:84%
of people operating on
a shoestring budget.

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:58.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's very difficult to do.

00:54:58.550 --> 00:54:59.850 align:middle line:90%
But we will get it.

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going to step
up, eventually, with money.

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Give us what we need to
do what we need to do.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And when we get that
answer, we will win.

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.640 align:middle line:84%
We will absolutely
win this thing.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's hear it
for our guest, Lloyd Pye.

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:13.208 align:middle line:90%
Lloyd, thank you, so much.

00:55:13.208 --> 00:55:13.874 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:55:13.874 --> 00:55:15.296 align:middle line:84%
>> PYE: Thank you,
for having me.

00:55:15.296 --> 00:55:16.379 align:middle line:90%
I like to watch your show.

00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:17.670 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, it's
really amazing to think that

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm holding the skull of an
extraterrestrial being that

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:28.820 align:middle line:84%
visited this planet
some 900 years ago.

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.470 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of weird, actually.

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:32.910 align:middle line:90%
But here it is.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:54.134 align:middle line:90%
