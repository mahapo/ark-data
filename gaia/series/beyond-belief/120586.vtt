00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:18.462 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:10%
You know, since
the dawn of ages,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.320 align:middle line:10%
mankind has been fascinated
with the unknown,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:10%
with the mysteries,
with the occult.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And we've got an
occult historian

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:90%
with us, Mitch Horowitz.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of "Occult
America" and "One Simple Idea."

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Mitch, welcome to the program.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now, what
does this all mean?

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:90%
What is the occult?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>What do Hillary
Clinton, Donald Trump,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:84%
George Washington, and
Ronald Reagan have in common?

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:10%
According to Mitch
Horowitz, it's

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:10%
the occult. Horowitz, the
author of the award winning book

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:10%
"Occult America," says, not
only was our nation founded

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.950 align:middle line:10%
upon esoteric beliefs,
mystical spirituality,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:10%
and occult practices,
but the concept

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:10%
that our thoughts can
change our reality

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:10%
is a belief as rooted in
American culture as the right

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:10%
to life and liberty.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:84%
As for the pursuit of
happiness, Horowitz

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
encourages us to deploy the
techniques of positive mind

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
metaphysics and see how
they work firsthand.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Further, Horowitz explains how
superstitions and other beliefs

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:90%
affect our lives.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Occult
historian Mitch Horowitz,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
that was a great
introduction about you, sir.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you, George.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Those are the things I love.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.134 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:90%
in dabbling with the occult?

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, I grew up in
Queens, New York in the 1970s,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:10%
and it was a very exciting time.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That explains
it right there.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes,
doesn't that do it?

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:10%
The paranormal was everywhere.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:10%
You would see astrologers
and robed gurus

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:10%
on "The Mike Douglas Show."

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:84%
We would rush home to watch
reruns of "The Twilight Zone."

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I would take out all
these books on the occult,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and UFOs, and the paranormal
from our local library.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was just in
the groundwater,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and I never lost
my interest in it.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
we say the occult,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:84%
some people think you're
talking about a cult.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: C-U-L-T.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're not.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Talking about something else.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right on.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
important to be clear,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
sinister about this.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
The occult, very
simply, is the belief

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:84%
in an invisible world,
an invisible dimension,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
whose influences and forces can
be felt upon us and through us.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
This belief has always existed.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
You find it within
the mainstream faiths.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you find it outside
the mainstream faiths,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:84%
we tend to call it the
occult. It means the hidden.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do some
people, and so many people,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
think it's very dangerous
or it's very evil?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Look,
it's human nature.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
In late antiquity,
the early Church

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
was in a really historic
struggle with the remaining

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:90%
order of the pagan world.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
The church prevailed and
tended to classify everything

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
that belonged to the old
world, to the occult world,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:90%
as evil or sinister.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.209 align:middle line:90%
We see it happen all the time.

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much different
than people who are

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Satanic practitioners, right?

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: For sure, for sure.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
My contention is there is no
legitimate history of Satanism

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:90%
in the West.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
To have a tradition,
you need a family tree.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:90%
You need a liturgy.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:84%
You need to be able to point
to historical documents.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:90%
They're really not there.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So my message is that
Satanism is a bunch of hoo ha.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
People can call themselves
whatever they want,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:84%
but it has no real
tradition in the West.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hitler was interested
in the occult as well.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: He was.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost obsessed.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.798 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes,
that is very true.

00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And I always remind
people, though,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
that although there was interest
in the occult within Hitler's

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
inner circle, the occultists,
and the astrologers,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and the archaeologists who
were invited into that circle

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:90%
were all eventually killed.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.526 align:middle line:84%
They found their way to
the concentration camps

00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:90%
like all the other victims.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.191 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, in
our opening, we just

00:03:56.191 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:84%
saw Hillary Clinton, Donald
Trump, Ronald Reagan,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
all interested,
dabbling in the occult?

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, you find the
same percentage of interest

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:84%
in the occult and the esoteric
among people in power as you

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:90%
do among everyday people.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.250 align:middle line:10%
So for example, Donald
Trump will tell people

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:10%
that the most influential
book he ever read

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:10%
was "The Power of
Positive Thinking"

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:10%
by Norman Vincent Peale.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:10%
That was positive
mind mysticism spread

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.810 align:middle line:10%
throughout the
mainstream of America.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Peale, in that book, talks about
some very metaphysical ideas.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
He talks about the
magnetic powers

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.630 align:middle line:84%
of our mind, the power
of prayer therapy,

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
how thoughts can actually
make things happen.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And Trump swears by that
book as the book that really

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:90%
launched him into business.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you call
that occult, that book?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
I think you could,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.953 align:middle line:90%
if you stretched the definition.

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Peale was a
conservative, Methodist

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:90%
minister.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
He certainly didn't
view himself.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, if you told
him you're an occultist,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:90%
he'd freak out.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.433 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He would
freak out, but he

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:84%
did read and had a great deal
of respect for certain people

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
who came out of the
occult tradition.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Peale's genius was to take
their ideas and reprocess them

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
through language that the
church-going public could

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.794 align:middle line:90%
find acceptable.

00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of my
favorite little books

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.715 align:middle line:84%
is called "The Magic of
Believing" by Claude Bristol.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Wonderful book.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it teaches you
things, gives you techniques.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
call that occult?

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, I would.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I would.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Claude Bristol was
a wonderful man.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.900 align:middle line:84%
He was a newspaper
reporter, who dedicated

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:84%
his life to spreading some of
these ideas to mainstream folk.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:90%
He believed in ESP.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:90%
He believed in psychical powers.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
He believed that the
mind very definitely

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:84%
has causative
powers, and you don't

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:90%
need to belong to a religion.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
If it's your choice, you don't
need to believe in God in order

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:90%
to work with that material.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Claude was a wonderful,
mainstream guy,

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
but he was dealing with
topics from the occult.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you get
in trouble, Mitch,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:90%
dabbling with the occult?

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I have
to answer, yes.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.890 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, I might have
said no to that question,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
but the truth is, if you
take out the old Ouija

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.022 align:middle line:90%
board or one of these things--

00:06:05.022 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's an
occult apparatus, right?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh,
without question.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It comes out of the age of
spiritualism here in America.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
That was the trend of
talking to the dead.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
That was very popular in this
country in the 19th century,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and remains so.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
When you open a door,
it's like visiting

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:84%
a website you don't
know online, you

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:84%
don't know who's there,
where they're located,

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and what they're all about.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody tells
you online to send them

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.134 align:middle line:84%
a check so that they can send
you some valuable object,

00:06:32.134 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
you better know who
you're dealing with.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
thing with the occult,

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and things like Ouija boards.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the occult can be
dangerous in the wrong hands.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It can be dangerous.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
In the wrong hands,
it can be dangerous.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Although I would argue
anything can be dangerous.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
We deal with ethical
judgment calls all day long.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember the Reverend
Jim Jones who

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
coerced his followers
into this mass suicide

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:90%
in the jungles of Latin America.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
He was a Disciples
of Christ minister,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
not a New Ager,
not an occultist.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:90%
So there are choices.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.090 align:middle line:84%
There are ethical choices that
we're faced with everywhere.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
think he was insane.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, for sure.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And enormously
charismatic, unfortunately

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:90%
for his followers.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
creates the insanity?

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:90%
The occult?

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Or were they insane
from the get-go?

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I tend to think that
the great flaw in human nature

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
is wanting to tell
other people what to do.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And when people find they
have the ability to do that,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:84%
they want more,
and more, and more.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So they use whatever
pulpit they have,

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
whatever position
of power they have,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.170 align:middle line:90%
and they want to expand it.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, it goes in
horribly tragic directions.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ronald Reagan
and Nancy Reagan

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:84%
were very interested
in the occult as well.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.371 align:middle line:84%
She probably more
than him, right?

00:07:41.371 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: You know,
they were really very much

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:10%
a new age couple.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
They lived in Hollywood
for about three decades.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Their friends, and neighbors,
and the various actors

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and performers they circulated
among, all had new age tastes.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The Reagans were interested
in astrology, numerology,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:90%
good luck charms, superstitions.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Reagan would very freely tell
people he had witnessed UFOs,

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
he had had psychical
dreams, he had

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.630 align:middle line:90%
had out of body experiences.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:84%
He continued to
talk this way even

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.180 align:middle line:84%
on the campaign trail
for the presidency.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Even after he was
elected president,

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.820 align:middle line:90%
he was unembarrassed about it.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It just tells you how American
all this stuff really is.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I could just
see him now saying, well,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.325 align:middle line:90%
there are UFOs everywhere.

00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He would
love to be on this show.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:84%
You guys wouldn't
know when to stop.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was told years ago
that Nancy Reagan consulted

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:35.150 align:middle line:84%
with a numerologist and changed
the address of their house

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:90%
in Bel Air.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's true.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a true story?

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.611 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That is true.

00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Nancy changed the house number
of their retirement home

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.940 align:middle line:90%
in Bel Air.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
She took this material
very seriously.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
She consulted with
several astrologers.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
The last one was Joan
Quigley, who died recently.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
But Nancy had relationships
with the psychic Jeane Dixon,

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and she had a relationship
with an astrologer named

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Carroll Righter, who is
not well remembered today.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But he was a man who
lived in Santa Monica,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and he was the first
and only astrologer ever

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
to appear on the cover of
"Time Magazine" in 1969.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem, in
those days, too, Mitch,

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:90%
to be really into it.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know on Coast to
Coast we do a lot of this,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:90%
as you well know.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:84%
You've been a frequent
guest of ours.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.265 align:middle line:84%
But in those days,
the mainstream media,

00:09:21.265 --> 00:09:24.449 align:middle line:84%
the magazines, really
got interested in that.

00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, for sure.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't seem
to be doing that today.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.038 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
it's interesting.

00:09:29.038 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
In certain respects,
George, our country

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.300 align:middle line:84%
was more religiously
liberal a generation ago.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so too.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.466 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: You know, Merv
Griffin had his own house

00:09:37.466 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
astrologer, Sydney Omar,
who you'd probably remember.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Sydney was on the West Coast.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
He was on "The Merv
Griffin show" all the time.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
The Maharishi and
other yogis used

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:84%
to appear on Mike Douglas
and the other talk shows.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a certain
freedom, and I

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
think we've grown
a little coarser,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:84%
a little more brittle
about these things today.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
about Jimmy Carter?

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:84%
What was his involvement
with the occult.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.086 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Carter was
a very interesting guy.

00:10:00.086 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:10%
Not only did he speak in a very
forthright way about witnessing

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.350 align:middle line:10%
UFOs, but he used
psychical spies

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:10%
to help locate a downed
Soviet jet in central Africa.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke very
freely of this.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
He told a group of students in
Atlanta after his presidency

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
that there was, in
fact, a psychical spy

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:90%
program in the CIA.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Bill Clinton canceled it.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:90%
It no longer exists.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:84%
It was called
Operation Stargate.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Carter used--

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a
remote viewing program.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.794 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Remote viewing.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Carter used three remote viewers
to pinpoint the coordinates

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:90%
of a downed Soviet jet.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.127 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA was able to reach
that jet before a Soviet rescue

00:10:37.127 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
operation did, and they got
some intelligence out of it.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.145 align:middle line:84%
Carter spoke of
this very freely.

00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many of
those Stargate members

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:84%
have been guests
on Coast to Coast.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.906 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm baffled why
they stopped the program.

00:10:47.906 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, it
was post-Cold War.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.655 align:middle line:84%
They were looking to cut
money wherever they could.

00:10:51.655 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
The program was only
funded at $20 million,

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.649 align:middle line:84%
which in terms of our
defense budget, is peanuts.

00:10:56.649 --> 00:10:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But Clinton probably thought
it was a little bit loopy,

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.523 align:middle line:84%
and it was a good
place to make a cut.

00:11:00.523 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a shame, because
they did do promising research,

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's very difficult
to make people understand.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the American public is
cost conscious, and I get that.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:middle line:84%
But $20 million is a drop in
the bucket at the Pentagon,

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and this was a program that
really pushed frontiers.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets were doing it,
so we felt we had to do it.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And why not?

00:11:16.645 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
I still think the
Soviets, the Russians,

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:90%
may still be doing it.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh,
they are, indeed.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:90%
They are, indeed.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And they have an
interesting method.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
What the Russians
will do is they

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:84%
will combine
psychical intelligence

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:84%
with other more conventionally
gathered intelligence.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And they take it
seriously as one channel

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle line:90%
of information among others.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were mentioning
Donald Trump and his belief

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
of positive thinking, which
I believed in for a long time

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what some mainstream

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.939 align:middle line:90%
America thinks about that.

00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:45.605 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: The power
of positive thinking,

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:90%
I do believe it works.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe because our
body is like a mechanism,

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually
change our DNA,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and we can change our own neural
pathways just by introducing

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.620 align:middle line:90%
positive thought into our mind.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Positive energy
is a good thing,

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like it brings
good things around you.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: Our original
personalities, beliefs,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and souls are based
off positivity.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.502 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: If you think you can do
it, you're much more likely to.

00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: Yeah, power
of positive thinking

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.334 align:middle line:84%
is like manifesting things
that you want to happen.

00:12:19.334 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:90%
So I think, yeah.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:90%
I totally believe in that.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: I believe that a slightly
positive outlook of life

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.399 align:middle line:90%
will allow you to go further.

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: Your attitude
is everything,

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and if you say good things
are going to happen,

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:90%
good things are going to happen.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where it comes
from, but I think it's awesome.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch, it's good to
see so many people really tuned

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
into the fact that believing
in positive thinking

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.355 align:middle line:90%
enhances your life.

00:12:44.355 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, and
just look at these kids.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:10%
They're educated.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:10%
They're articulate.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.720 align:middle line:10%
They're confident.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
They are espousing what is
really the American creed.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
If there is one idea
that unites everyone

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:84%
in this country across the
political and religious

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:84%
spectrum, it is that
thoughts are causative.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:84%
In some way or
another, what you think

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:84%
has a concrete impact
on what happens to you.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And millions of
Americans believe

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.050 align:middle line:90%
this, and with very good reason.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Positive or negative.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Positive or
negative, absolutely.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And you can see from
the way these kids

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
we're talking that they
have thought about this.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
They have heard
about this before.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:84%
150 years ago, if you told
someone, think positive,

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:84%
they might have looked
at you a little funny.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
But there was a mental
healing movement

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.940 align:middle line:84%
bubbling up from New
England here in the US.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And that movement broadened
and morphed into the idea

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.640 align:middle line:84%
that there is some kind of
mentally causative power

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:90%
that courses through us.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
That was the start of the
power of positive thinking.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.955 align:middle line:84%
It's mystical,
and it's American.

00:13:43.955 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know the
phrase psychic vampire.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, for sure.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the ability of
somebody, whether they know it

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.697 align:middle line:84%
or not, to suck the energy
from people who are near them.

00:13:52.697 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Now, some
people object and say,

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
if we think positive, does
that mean we're unrealistic,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
or we're milquetoast, or people
are going to walk all over us?

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
absolutely not.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
The pioneers of
positive thinking,

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:90%
they were not pacifists.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:90%
They were not passive.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.112 align:middle line:84%
You could think of it
as deliberate thinking.

00:14:11.112 --> 00:14:12.820 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
where you find yourself

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.170 align:middle line:84%
or what you're doing in life,
whether you're an artist,

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a soldier,
whether you're a teacher.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a deliberateness
that we can cultivate.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
positive thinking is.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why is it that some
people shroud themselves

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:10%
in negativity?

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Why do they do
this to themselves?

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe they don't know it.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I think,
secretly, they enjoy it.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And we have to watch for that
very carefully in ourselves.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:84%
We like complaining
in a certain sense.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:90%
We like bad news.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.121 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
excitement we get from it,

00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:42.162 align:middle line:90%
a certain adrenal thrill.

00:14:42.162 --> 00:14:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, bad
news leads the news.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been in the news
business all my life, Mitch.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Never did we ever start
a newscast by saying,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
somebody did
something good today.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right, right.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's at
the end of the show.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.091 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right, right.

00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
perverse thrill

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.946 align:middle line:90%
we get from the negative.

00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important to
watch that in ourselves.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Because if you ask anybody,
they'll say, well, of course

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:90%
I want to be happy.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Are you so sure about that?

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Have you really observed
your thought processes,

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
your relationships,
your choices?

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you? / I think
it's all up for grabs.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:84%
People have to ask themselves
very tough questions about

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:90%
whether they enjoy negativity.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You might
be right about that.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Strange things, weird
America, mystical things,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:84%
strange symbols, the Denver
airport, where we are.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:84%
You walk through
that airport, you

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:84%
see weird structures, weird
paintings and everything else.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:90%
You're from New York.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Grand Central Station,
the train station

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.787 align:middle line:84%
is also laden in
strange symbols.

00:15:41.787 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Grand Central,
probably the most famous train

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:84%
station in the world, is a
temple of occult and mythical

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:90%
imagery.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Cornelius Vanderbilt
owned the land

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:84%
on which Grand
Central was built.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:90%
He was a committed spiritualist.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:84%
He told a newspaper
reporter in the year 1870

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that if people wanted to find
their way to fame and fortune

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
as he had, they should do what
he did-- consult the spirits.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.870 align:middle line:84%
When Grand Central Station
was being erected on the land

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:84%
that he owned, his grandson,
William K Vanderbilt,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.800 align:middle line:84%
who was deeply interested
in the occult and mythology,

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:84%
helped personally supervise
some of the imagery that

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
was chosen, including the
beautiful, really iconic statue

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
of Mercury, which is one of the
largest in the modern world.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So you had this
marriage of interest

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
in spiritualism,
theosophy, theology,

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.170 align:middle line:84%
new forms of architecture,
that were all placing

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:90%
their mark on Grand Central.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, the
great indicator of that

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is the zodiac mural
that characterizes

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.400 align:middle line:84%
the ceiling of the Grand
Rotunda in Grand Central.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest zodiac
mural in the modern world.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How strange
is that, Mitch?

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.611 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Isn't it something?

00:16:53.611 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Right there in plain view.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.363 align:middle line:84%
People come to New
York City, and they

00:16:56.363 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:84%
say tell me some occult
hot spots I can visit.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.177 align:middle line:90%
And I tell them, Grand Central.

00:17:00.177 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:10%
And they're shocked,
because how could

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:10%
a place that hundreds
of thousands of people

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:10%
pass through every
week have some sort

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:10%
of an occult back story?

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:10%
But it's there.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:10%
If you look up at that ceiling,
what you will see symbolized

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:10%
in the section of
zodiac that appears

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:10%
on the enormous domed
ceiling is the coming

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:10%
of the Age of Aquarius,
the so-called Aquarian Age,

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:10%
which is supposed to be an
era of mystical spirituality,

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:10%
and education, and
experimentation.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
In the early 20th
century, people

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:84%
like Cornelius Vanderbilt
and artists and others

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:84%
took very seriously the
notion that humanity was

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:90%
poised for this Aquarian Age.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
It's right there on the
ceiling in probably the largest

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
zodiac painting in
the modern world.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By tapping
into this occult world,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:84%
what does it do
for an individual?

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Does it enhance their life?

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.675 align:middle line:90%
Do they become better people?

00:17:51.675 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:90%
What happens to them?

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.841 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: If they're smart,
and if they're sensitive,

00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:90%
yes, it enhances their life.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the place that
they find themselves in

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
is the realization that we are
all receiving and emanating

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:84%
stations, that our
thoughts really matter.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.020 align:middle line:84%
They're substantive,
material things.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:84%
It is equally important,
maybe more important,

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
what we think about a
person or an experience

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:84%
than what we actually
say, because what we think

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
is very intimate, very
emotionally charged, and very

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are a force, and
people who get into the occult

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
almost always come around
to that realization.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
If they use it well, it
will improve life for them

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.110 align:middle line:90%
and for others around them.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wiccan is a belief
in a male-female god.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
got them confused

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
with Satanic worshippers, or
being evil witches and things

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.349 align:middle line:90%
That's changing, isn't it?

00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It really is.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:10%
And the place where you
can see the change most

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:10%
is in our own
military right now.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
In 2005, the Air Force
commissioned a study

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:84%
to find out what faiths its
various members practice,

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
so they could properly
apportion chaplains.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:84%
1,800 people in
that Air Force study

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:84%
listed Wiccan, or
witchcraft, or neo-paganism,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.770 align:middle line:90%
as their religion.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was just in one
branch of the service,

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.814 align:middle line:84%
and that was just
among the group that

00:19:16.814 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:84%
was willing to be
public about it,

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:84%
because people are sometimes
worried about peer pressure

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands
and thousands

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
of practicing Wiccans
in the military.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to a lawsuit
that was brought

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
by some folks who were
representing Wiccan families--

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because people didn't
understand what Wicca was.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: They didn't
understand what it was.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a nature-based
religion that

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
draws upon ancient practices,
believes in a male-female god.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And Wiccan service members
now can get Wiccan symbols

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:84%
on tombstones or other
official things that

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:90%
are issued by the military.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Wicca is a recognized
religion in the US military.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.835 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of society is going
to follow the Military's lead.

00:19:55.835 --> 00:19:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wiccans
are good people.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Terrific people.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It's nature-based.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It's feminine-based.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.501 align:middle line:84%
And I knew when this
lawsuit was brought

00:20:03.501 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:90%
the Wiccans were going to win.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.857 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell a service
member, well, you're

00:20:06.857 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
serving our country,
but you can only choose

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:90%
from one of several religions.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:11.919 align:middle line:90%
They name their religion.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:90%
The government honors it.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You see how things
get blown out of proportion?

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And that's really
the greatest aspect of America.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the protection of the
individual search for meaning.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:84%
The Military can't tell
you, as a service member,

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.780 align:middle line:90%
what chapel you're going to.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:84%
You tell them, and they
have to honor that.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the greatness
of our country.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say
that going way back

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
to the biblical days
of Jesus, that they too

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:90%
dabbled in the occult?

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, the
occult, whether it

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
divination, or talking

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.860 align:middle line:84%
to the dead, or the
belief in an afterlife,

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:84%
it's always going on within
the mainstream faiths, always.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
You find astrology
within Judaism.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's there.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Sure.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:84%
You find channeling
within Catholicism.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But when it occurs outside
the parameters of one

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
of the historic faiths, we
tend to call it the occult.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's everywhere.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
We could call it mysticism,
meaning a direct contact

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:90%
with the divine.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.619 align:middle line:84%
If we call it mysticism,
you find it everywhere,

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:84%
but we tend to call it
the occult when it's

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.915 align:middle line:90%
outside of one of the faiths.

00:21:09.915 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's go
to some e-mails

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:10%
that people have
written in on, Mitch.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm told that the Illuminati
controls Hollywood,

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and that I have seen their
images in Disney films,

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:90%
and that they control banks.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Is this true?

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.498 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
I know this might

00:21:23.498 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:84%
turn a few people
watching off to me,

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.430 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is, I think
the Illuminati is wonderful.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:90%
I love the Illuminati.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:90%
The Illuminati--

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, why
don't we back up now.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: I'm sorry.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I've got to give
it to you straight.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I hope people
will hear me out.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:84%
The Illuminati was a group that
was found in 1776 in Bavaria

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:84%
to celebrate values of religious
freedom, the spiritual search,

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:90%
the dignity of the individual.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they did
use occult symbols.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
They were a renegade
offshoot of Freemasonry.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
They had hoped to infiltrate
Freemasonic lodges

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and turn them into vehicles
for Enlightenment values.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Historically speaking,
the Illuminati

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:84%
disappeared about nine
years after its founding,

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.070 align:middle line:84%
because of laws that the
government in Bavaria

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:90%
passed against it.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is,
Thomas Jefferson was

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.420 align:middle line:90%
an admirer of the Illuminati.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:10%
In January, 1800,
he wrote to a friend

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:10%
that the founder
of the Illuminati,

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:10%
a Bavarian lawyer
named Adam Weishaupt,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't have had
to be secretive

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.420 align:middle line:10%
if he lived in
the United States,

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.590 align:middle line:10%
because in the United States,
all the things that he

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.379 align:middle line:10%
was trying to accomplish
were actually legal.

00:22:28.379 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were being done.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: So Jefferson
believed, quite rightly,

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.001 align:middle line:84%
that the Illuminati
was secret because they

00:22:33.001 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:84%
would have lost their
heads if the government had

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:90%
gotten on to them.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:84%
But I truthfully feel that
the historical Illuminati

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.267 align:middle line:84%
has contributed wonderful
things to our world.

00:22:41.267 --> 00:22:42.891 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
to be afraid of it.

00:22:42.891 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you say
the historical Illuminati.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.235 align:middle line:84%
What about the
current Illuminati?

00:22:47.235 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I really
don't subscribe to that.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I think people are looking
in the wrong places.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
They're looking down a
blind alley, quite frankly.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Evil that exists in our
world-- and it is there.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:84%
It is there-- it's in the
ways that our institutions,

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.710 align:middle line:84%
both private and
public, de-humanize us.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It's what happens when you call
up to ask about a health claim,

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're put on
hold for 20 minutes,

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and then you're disconnected,
and so on and so forth.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
evil in that than there

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
is in supposed halls of power
somewhere with pentagrams.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another e-mail in from
Paul in Steubenville, Texas.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Mitch.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if you
had anything to help

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:90%
with a spinal cord injury.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever used
positive mind control

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:90%
to heal like a spinal cord?

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:90%
That's a tough one.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It is a tough one.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
question, and it has

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.060 align:middle line:90%
to be handled very delicately.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:84%
What I advocate is an all
and everything approach.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Get the best in medical
care, whether mainstream or

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.525 align:middle line:90%
alternative, your choice.

00:23:47.525 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Pray, surround yourself with
loving, supportive people.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Use visualizations.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Use affirmations.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
when you're dealing

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:84%
with an illness or any
other critical life event,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:90%
you use everything.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:90%
You use medicine.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.920 align:middle line:90%
You use prayer.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.480 align:middle line:90%
You use mysticism.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Alternative, mainstream,
make your informed choices,

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:90%
but use everything.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So I would send that person
a variety of prayers,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and affirmations,
and visualizations.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Tell him use these
things committedly

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:90%
and go to the doctor.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The doctor's important.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.151 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You tie that in.

00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I believe in a
completely holistic approach,

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:84%
where you use mainstream
medicine, which

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.340 align:middle line:90%
is wonderful in many ways.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And you complement it with
various positive mind methods.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch, in
our final e-mail,

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:90%
we have one from Seattle.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%
It says, I'm a mother
in Seattle, Mitch.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And my high school age
daughter is involved

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:90%
with Wicca, or witchcraft.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I find pentagrams
on her notebooks.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I was told these
things are evil.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Should I be concerned about her?

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: You know, George,
I get this question frequently.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And as a parent of two boys,
I take it very seriously.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I say this, Wiccan
kids are good kids.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:90%
They're sensitive.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.220 align:middle line:90%
They're independent.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:90%
They're curious.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:84%
No parent who finds
that their kid is

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
getting into Wicca or
witchcraft should be worried.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not evil.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient,
nature-based religion that's

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:90%
experienced a revival today.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:90%
It's ethical.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It's socially concerned.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And kids who are
into Wicca I find

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:84%
to be some of the most
sensitive, most trustworthy

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.520 align:middle line:90%
kids you can come across.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.791 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, are
all witches Wiccan?

00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:30.915 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, the term
is used interchangeably.

00:25:30.915 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or if you're a
Wiccan, are you a witch?

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.193 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
the fact is the term

00:25:34.193 --> 00:25:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Wiccan is an old English
term for clever folk,

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and it was occasionally
used during the revival

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:90%
of witchcraft in the 1950s.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's become
a term of choice.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Most people who call
themselves witches or neo-pagan

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.630 align:middle line:84%
would also say,
yeah, I'm Wiccan.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.940 align:middle line:84%
It's an umbrella
term that's embraced.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so Teddy
Roosevelt, late President

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:59.570 align:middle line:84%
of the United States, a long
time ago was into Bigfoot.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:90%
What's that story?

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The man who
wrote the scariest Bigfoot

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:90%
story you will ever read.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:84%
He was hunting in Montana and
Idaho in the late 19th century.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And his hunting guide, they
were alone just the two of them,

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.190 align:middle line:90%
out on the prairie.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Told him a story that
years earlier the guide

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and his friend had been attacked
by this upright man-like

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:84%
creature that
looked like a bear,

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:90%
but it walked on hind legs.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:84%
It killed his friend,
and there were

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:84%
four different sets of fang
marks on the friend's corpse.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And he told Roosevelt
all about it.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt was a very hard-headed
guy, a very skeptical guy.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:84%
But he took it seriously
enough to include it

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:90%
in his hunting memoirs.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you read it,
it will chill you.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a very frightening story,
one of the first Bigfoot

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.495 align:middle line:90%
narratives in American history.

00:26:56.495 --> 00:26:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
an amazing story.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Isn't
that something?

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from an
American President.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Abraham
Lincoln, his wife

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.807 align:middle line:84%
Mary Todd Lincoln, they
were into the occult.

00:27:04.807 --> 00:27:07.140 align:middle line:84%
They were into seances in the
White House, weren't they?

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, sir.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I have researched
it, and the fact

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.100 align:middle line:84%
is, there is concrete evidence
that the Lincoln's had one,

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.560 align:middle line:84%
probably two, maybe more
seances in the Crimson

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Room of the White House.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:10%
Lincoln permitted a reporter
from the Boston Gazette

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:10%
to be present at one
of these seances.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Sandburg
and other historians

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.370 align:middle line:84%
wondered why would Lincoln
have permitted a reporter

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:84%
present at something that
you would think could be

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:90%
embarrassing or compromising?

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, in the mid-19th
century, spiritualism,

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:84%
seances, talking to the
dead, was very popular

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think Lincoln had a
political purpose in mind.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.620 align:middle line:84%
It was during the
Civil War, and he

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:84%
wanted to show people,
including in the Confederacy,

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that the Commander-in-Chief
was not so encumbered

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:84%
but wartime command that
he couldn't take a break,

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.040 align:middle line:84%
take some time out, and
engage in this kind of parlor

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
experiment that a lot
of Americans were doing.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It was written about not only
in Boston, but in newspapers

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.930 align:middle line:90%
of the Confederacy.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think Lincoln believed it
presented him in a good light.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't completely
distracted with the war,

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and he could experiment with
something that many Americans

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:13.870 align:middle line:90%
were into at the time.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he not
have an occult dream

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.942 align:middle line:90%
about his own assassination?

00:28:16.942 --> 00:28:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: He certainly did.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.210 align:middle line:90%
He certainly did.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Before Lincoln was
elected president,

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.200 align:middle line:84%
he had a dream or
some kind of a vision,

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:84%
where he saw two images
of himself in a mirror.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:84%
One image, he was
filled with vigor.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The other image, he
was wan and pale.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And his wife, Mary Todd,
who was very into prophecies

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.854 align:middle line:84%
and spiritualism, told
him it was a prophecy

00:28:38.854 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:84%
that he would be killed before
the end of his second term.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he had a dream
of a body in the parlor

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:84%
at the White House
surrounded by military guard.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And as he's walking,
in a dream, walking

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:57.325 align:middle line:84%
into the scene to find out who's
in the coffin, he sees himself.

00:28:57.325 --> 00:28:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's correct.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke about
these things to people.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:84%
He told them to secretaries,
to confidants, to his wife.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's in
the history books.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Like Ronald Reagan, he didn't
hide this side of himself.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.320 align:middle line:90%
He was very forthright about it.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Superstitions.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:90%
What creates superstitions?

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Superstitions
really tie us

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:84%
to some of the oldest beliefs
of our ancient ancestors.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.220 align:middle line:84%
The number 13, for example,
in cultures across the world,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:84%
from India to some of the
Nordic cultures, to old England,

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.022 align:middle line:84%
people have believed that the
number 13 has bad associations.

00:29:32.022 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to run
from that number, Mitch.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Now I welcome it.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.781 align:middle line:90%
I just go right at it.

00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The truth is some
people are still so frightened

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.840 align:middle line:84%
of it that if you go to a
hotel, a high rise hotel,

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.350 align:middle line:84%
chances are there's
no 13th floor.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:90%
You find it all the time.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.720 align:middle line:84%
In casinos, in
apartment buildings,

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.726 align:middle line:84%
in hotels, a lot of
people just won't have it.

00:29:50.726 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
how people out there

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.045 align:middle line:90%
in America view superstitions.

00:29:56.045 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMAN: Am I superstitious?

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, probably.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of, like step on a crack,

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.400 align:middle line:90%
break your mother's back.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some
old superstitions that

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:90%
are ingrained in my body.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.511 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: I do knock on wood
when something bad happens,

00:30:14.511 --> 00:30:15.940 align:middle line:90%
just for that superstition.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:90%
I think it means good luck.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:18.900 align:middle line:90%
I just do that.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: If you say
something that you really

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.800 align:middle line:84%
don't want to happen, but
you're afraid it might happen,

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.940 align:middle line:90%
knock on wood.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: Just in case if you
say something and the universe

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:84%
is out there and hears you,
it keeps your good luck going.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: I've heard you
shouldn't walk under a ladder,

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:90%
and I don't remember why.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid it's
probably dangerous.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.955 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Black cats, makes
me think of witchery.

00:30:43.955 --> 00:30:46.570 align:middle line:90%
And they say that's a bad sign.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: If one crosses you,
just in general bad luck.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMAN: If a black cat crossed
my path, I would love it.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.325 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.325 --> 00:30:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Mitch, where did
some of these superstitions

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:90%
come from?

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
really fascinating.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:00.898 align:middle line:90%
You'll find multiple sources.

00:31:00.898 --> 00:31:04.065 align:middle line:84%
For example, we're afraid
of walking under ladders.

00:31:04.065 --> 00:31:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Where did that idea come from?

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, it used to be that in
France, people would sometimes

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:14.876 align:middle line:84%
be hanged, criminals would
be hanged from a tree trunk.

00:31:14.876 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And they would be forced to walk
a ladder up to the tree trunk.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was believed that if
you crossed under the ladder,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:84%
their ghosts could
be lurking there.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: So that's why.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought maybe
somebody walked under a ladder

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and a paint bucket fell on
them or something like that.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It does
seem practical.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It does seem to have
a practical purpose.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But actually, both
the ancient Chinese

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient Egyptians
believed in the sacredness

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:90%
of the triangular shape.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's this notion that
a ladder, forming a triangle,

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:84%
has some energies dwelling
there that might disrupt you,

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.840 align:middle line:84%
or you might disrupt them,
if you pass under it.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tossing salt
over your shoulder.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Very
old superstition.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, we see a painting
that Leonardo da Vinci did

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.100 align:middle line:84%
of the Last Supper,
where Judas is

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.350 align:middle line:84%
seen to be spilling
the salt. That's

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:90%
one of many associations.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spilling the salt.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.436 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Spilling the salt,
one of many associations we

00:32:02.436 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:84%
have of it being bad
luck to waste your salt.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.970 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient world, salt
was a form of currency.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:12.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our term salary
is rooted in the term salt.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So the superstition developed
that if you wasted your salt,

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.210 align:middle line:84%
you might be spilling
away your own prosperity.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:84%
In old England, it was
believed that a little demon

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and a little angel hovered
over everyone's shoulders,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:84%
just like you see
in the cartoons.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you spill your
salt, you toss a bit

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.680 align:middle line:84%
over the left shoulder
to blind the demon.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:90%
I do it every day.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I did it this
morning at breakfast.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.029 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the movie "Dune,"
they talked about the salt.

00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
historically accurate.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Frank Herbert, the author,
was researching ancient Roman

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
practices to weave
into the film.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.010 align:middle line:84%
The Romans regarded salt
as a kind of currency.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Black cats
going across you.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
In the Middle Ages, Europe
and England in particular,

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.470 align:middle line:90%
was overrun by cats.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:90%
There was an epidemic of cats.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And people thought
of them as pests.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Old women, village
women, who were alone,

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.530 align:middle line:84%
who were spinsters or widows,
and were sometimes accused

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.929 align:middle line:84%
of witchcraft, were friends
to these roving bands of cats.

00:33:11.929 --> 00:33:14.470 align:middle line:84%
They fed them, like you might
see someone in the park feeding

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:90%
pigeons today.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So this belief took hold
that somehow these cats

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:22.400 align:middle line:84%
were the familiars or the
spirit guides of witches.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.130 align:middle line:90%
And people began to shun them.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.480 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid of black
cats, because the devil was

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.301 align:middle line:90%
associated with a black dog.

00:33:28.301 --> 00:33:30.425 align:middle line:84%
So that belief just traveled
over to the black cat.

00:33:30.425 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And red eyes.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right, right.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Knock on wood.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You heard the little folks
on the street there talking

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.330 align:middle line:84%
What's that
superstition all about?

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The
superstition is this,

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that ancient people believed
that trees contained spirits.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, these were evil
spirits or evil fairies that

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:90%
would play mischief on you.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you wanted to
ensure your good luck,

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.945 align:middle line:84%
you would knock on wood
to knock out the fairies.

00:33:52.945 --> 00:33:54.570 align:middle line:84%
There are some cultures
that still talk

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.480 align:middle line:90%
of knocking out the fairies.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I do it to this day.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.079 align:middle line:84%
One can think of it
as a kind of humility,

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:02.120 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging there are
some things I don't know.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:84%
There are some invisible things
that are out of my hands.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.122 align:middle line:90%
Knock on wood.

00:34:06.122 --> 00:34:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rabbit's foot?

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Carry it on you?

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of anything
more gross than carrying

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.190 align:middle line:90%
a foot of a dead animal on you.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.239 align:middle line:90%
Geez!

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Now there's an easy
one, and a fairly recent one,

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.060 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Actors have always been
famously superstitious.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:84%
In the 19th century,
many actors used

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.530 align:middle line:84%
to carry a rabbit's
foot in their

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.659 align:middle line:84%
make up box to use
it as a powder puff.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:31.332 align:middle line:84%
Well, eventually, we
invented the powder puff,

00:34:31.332 --> 00:34:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and people stopped using the
rabbit's foot for that reason,

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:90%
but they kept it for good luck.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And do you know that when
Franklin Roosevelt was

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:42.500 align:middle line:84%
running for president in 1932,
he carried a rabbit's foot

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.300 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And that same rabbit's foot
is on display at the Roosevelt

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.489 align:middle line:90%
Library in upstate New York.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you think of
it, it really is bizarre.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It is
bizarre, but people

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.429 align:middle line:84%
do these things,
I think, to make

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:56.239 align:middle line:84%
a demonstration of
humility, to say

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:84%
there's some part of
me that has no control,

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.060 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know what's coming next.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to honor that.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to acknowledge that.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How weird would
you look with a human foot

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:90%
around your neck?

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Pretty strange.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very strange.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.508 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And it would
make a bad powderpuff.

00:35:08.508 --> 00:35:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Skull and Bones,
part Yale University.

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.292 align:middle line:90%
Evil occult clubs?

00:35:12.292 --> 00:35:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I really
view Skull and Bones

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and some of those other
organizations as just

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.980 align:middle line:90%
rich kids' eating clubs.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:21.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
occult content anymore.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:90%
They may have at one time.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Some of these groups--

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they
may think they do.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.468 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: They
may think they do.

00:35:25.468 --> 00:35:27.430 align:middle line:84%
They may have taken a
cue from Freemasonry,

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:84%
which had very good reasons
for using esoteric symbols.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.259 align:middle line:84%
But today, it's just
a rich kids' club.

00:35:32.259 --> 00:35:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Mitch, we just
talked about Freemasonry,

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:84%
but do they control the
Federal Reserve, the President,

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:42.452 align:middle line:84%
and so many other
organizations and groups?

00:35:42.452 --> 00:35:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Not at all.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think Freemasonry
has been a wonderful influence

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:90%
on this country.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, there have
been a lot of presidents

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:50.560 align:middle line:90%
who have been Freemasons.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:84%
14 out of 44 presidents
have been Freemasons.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:57.780 align:middle line:84%
The last fully fledged
Freemason in the White House

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.440 align:middle line:90%
was Gerald Ford.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Not often thought of
as a mysterious figure.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton did belong to
a Freemasonic youth group.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:84%
At one time, Masonry
was very, very important

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.950 align:middle line:84%
in the civic, and political,
and commercial life.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they put on the
Shriners Circus, don't they?

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.784 align:middle line:84%
And they do a lot of
good things for charity.

00:36:13.784 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:84%
They have burn centers and
hospitals all over the nation.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Masonry did, at its
inception and still

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.310 align:middle line:84%
does, use occult symbols,
because they see themselves

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.030 align:middle line:84%
as being tied to
ancient cultures, Rome,

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Greece, Egypt, being
tied to a chain

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:90%
of the search for meaning.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not an evil group.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful group.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.130 align:middle line:84%
You could be a Catholic
and be a Freemason.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I have in-laws who are
Catholics and Freemasons.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm really hoping that this
chasm between the Church

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and Masonry will get
healed in our generation.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to spend
some time on the Ouija board.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Some time ago, I had
pledged on Coast to Coast

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.410 align:middle line:90%
to do a Ouija board show.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.040 align:middle line:90%
And we had three guests ready.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.540 align:middle line:90%
We had the Ouija board.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.270 align:middle line:90%
I canceled it.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I have always believed that
the Ouija board is a game.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But in the wrong hands, in
the wrong belief system,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.067 align:middle line:84%
it could be a portal
to the dark side.

00:37:10.067 --> 00:37:11.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I agree
with your caution.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.280 align:middle line:84%
The Ouija board is
a dangerous game,

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and people should approach
it with great care.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.200 align:middle line:84%
It grew up in this country out
of spiritualist communities

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.630 align:middle line:84%
in northern Ohio
in the late 1880s.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Around 1890, there was a
group of toy manufacturers

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.200 align:middle line:84%
in Baltimore who patented it,
and called it the Ouija board,

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.360 align:middle line:90%
and the rest is history.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It outsold Monopoly
in the late 1960s.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, but
the fact is, people

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:84%
do have a stream of
very frightening stories

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.930 align:middle line:84%
about experiences
with the Ouija board.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.320 align:middle line:84%
People say, for example,
that at first, they

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.980 align:middle line:84%
got helpful information, like
where my last car keys are.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They trick you.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.105 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: They trick you.

00:37:49.105 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes
they got threats,

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and these things were
very frightening.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.670 align:middle line:84%
People sometimes even talk
about physical phenomena

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.250 align:middle line:84%
that have occurred
in their own house

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.610 align:middle line:90%
after using a Ouija board.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the case is,
it should be approached

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.280 align:middle line:90%
with great, great caution.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Ouija is fascinating,
because it's the only device

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:84%
that we still use
today that comes

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.850 align:middle line:90%
from the age of spiritualism.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
frightening stories out there,

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and I would approach
it with great care.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is so
special about it?

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Why does it have the
ability to conjure up

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:23.540 align:middle line:84%
spirits, when all you have to do
is sit on the edge of your bed

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.407 align:middle line:84%
and go, spirits, come
in, spirits, come in?

00:38:26.407 --> 00:38:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Why the Ouija board?

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
awfully interesting.

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, I
found it hard to believe

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.700 align:middle line:84%
that something that came
in a shrink wrapped box

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.470 align:middle line:84%
with a barcode on it could
have any occult properties.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet, whatever is
happening with the Ouija

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.920 align:middle line:84%
board seems to be
summoning up something

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:90%
that can be very dark.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.654 align:middle line:84%
Now, look, skeptics
will say, oh, people

00:38:45.654 --> 00:38:46.820 align:middle line:90%
are just fooling themselves.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.590 align:middle line:84%
They're moving the
pointer themselves.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's grant them that for a
moment, just hypothetically.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's say that's true.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, what
are the gremlins that

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.300 align:middle line:90%
are hiding in our subconscious?

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Because stuff is coming out
that could be very ugly,

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.410 align:middle line:90%
that could be very angry.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Or are you contacting
something metaphysical?

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:04.827 align:middle line:84%
Whichever direction
you go in, you're

00:39:04.827 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:84%
left with some very
uncomfortable questions.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, then, is it
the board or the person?

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That is
a wonderful question.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:90%
It may be both.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people that when
you engage with a Ouija board,

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.020 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like visiting
a website or something

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.103 align:middle line:90%
that you've never been to.

00:39:19.103 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:90%
You don't know who's there.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.440 align:middle line:90%
How cautious would you be, then?

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You should be at
least that cautious

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.564 align:middle line:84%
when you're dealing
with a Ouija board.

00:39:25.564 --> 00:39:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly,
the planchette does

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.827 align:middle line:84%
move when people are
touching it, right?

00:39:28.827 --> 00:39:30.368 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: No
question, no question.

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I've used it myself, and
I've read all the literature.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
some people believe

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.910 align:middle line:84%
that it's some unconscious
automotive function.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem that way to
the people who are using it.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I've put my fingers
on the planchette.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:43.200 align:middle line:90%
I've felt the tug.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.170 align:middle line:90%
I've felt movement.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll tell you
my Ouija board story.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Back when I was
doing the Nighthawk

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:54.060 align:middle line:84%
local show in St. Louis, we
did a program on Ouija boards.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And my producer brought
the board into the studio.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And, Mitch, I have never
ever had technical issues

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.840 align:middle line:90%
in that studio.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.620 align:middle line:84%
That board is in that studio,
my audio board is blinking.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Something's going wrong with it.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:13.890 align:middle line:84%
The computer that
played the commercials

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.670 align:middle line:90%
is going in and out.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:84%
My phone calls from listeners
would snap in and out.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It was the weirdest thing
I've ever gone through.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.245 align:middle line:90%
And I look at the producer.

00:40:26.245 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:90%
His name was Howard.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, Howard, take this
board and get rid of it.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:90%
Get it out of the studio.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, all right.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.080 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So he takes it, and takes
it down the hallway.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:43.130 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he leaves, within
seconds, the audio board lights

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:90%
come back.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:45.890 align:middle line:90%
The computer is working.

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:48.500 align:middle line:90%
The phone system's OK.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there, doing
my show, Mitch, just in awe.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's
very interesting.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was called
the most dangerous doorway

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:84%
to the unconscious by
the psychic Edgar Cayce.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Cayce and his son Hugh Lynn
felt that the Ouija board

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:84%
could open some kind of a dark
door, whether it was within--

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A portal, a portal.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: A portal,
whether it was within us,

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.448 align:middle line:84%
or whether it was
something that we don't

00:41:12.448 --> 00:41:14.440 align:middle line:90%
see in the external world.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always hearing stories
about how the board can

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.570 align:middle line:90%
actually change people.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I was told a entire
story by someone

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:23.870 align:middle line:84%
who was given a derivative
of the Ouija board

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:25.930 align:middle line:84%
to review for a
New Age magazine.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.400 align:middle line:84%
She started receiving
threatening phone calls at work

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:84%
by this very gravelly,
deep-voiced man.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.760 align:middle line:90%
The police traced the calls.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.650 align:middle line:84%
They found the calls were
coming from her own home.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.570 align:middle line:84%
It was her son who had been
playing with this Ouija board

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:41.370 align:middle line:90%
knock-off--

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he possessed?

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And he experienced
some kind of possession

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.480 align:middle line:84%
or something, and he was
making threatening calls

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.280 align:middle line:90%
to his own mother.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So it can trip a
switch, and it should

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.540 align:middle line:90%
be treated very carefully.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As we wrap up and
we talk about the occult,

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I have got to talk
to you about evil.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Of course.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
evil come from?

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.784 align:middle line:90%
What creates evil?

00:42:03.784 --> 00:42:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's a
wonderful question.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Look.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, if
you had asked me,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.709 align:middle line:84%
do you believe there's
an evil entity,

00:42:10.709 --> 00:42:12.000 align:middle line:90%
do you believe there's a devil?

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.860 align:middle line:90%
I probably would have said no.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.030 align:middle line:90%
I've changed my mind.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:19.647 align:middle line:84%
I do think there is a palpable,
actual presence of evil.

00:42:19.647 --> 00:42:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know some people
listening would say, well,

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:23.560 align:middle line:84%
gee, then with all
this occult stuff,

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.250 align:middle line:84%
aren't you just
opening the door to it?

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.300 align:middle line:90%
We have that choice--

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Every day.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, maybe.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But I would venture that
we have that choice,

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and we face that choice
every day and all the time.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Evil, or the devil, can
enter into our experience

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:44.510 align:middle line:84%
any time we decide
to degrade or perform

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:47.590 align:middle line:84%
an act of violence,
non-defensive violence,

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:48.700 align:middle line:90%
against another person.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.440 align:middle line:84%
When we gossip, when we take
something that's not ours,

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.800 align:middle line:84%
when we're unaccountable, that's
when evil starts to come in.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.380 align:middle line:84%
It can come in
through the occult.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.570 align:middle line:84%
It can come in through
other spiritual practices.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It can come in
through the course

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.650 align:middle line:84%
of denying someone something
that's rightly theirs.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.180 align:middle line:84%
We're always facing
these things.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to
experiment in the occult,

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.910 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have an ethical
teaching at your back.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.210 align:middle line:90%
You've got to read the Gospels.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:14.960 align:middle line:84%
You've got to read
the "Dao de Jing."

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.640 align:middle line:84%
You've got to read one of the
great, enduring ethical pieces

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.590 align:middle line:90%
of literature.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:19.830 align:middle line:90%
Prepare yourself.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Prepare yourself.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It can be wonderful, but
you need moral guidance too.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are
preaching right now

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of people watching
this television program.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to them?

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.320 align:middle line:84%
They're at home, thinking
about, hey, you know what?

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to dabble
with the occult.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to do a
little bit of that.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I want to go out
and get a Ouija board.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:84%
What do you tell
them to protect them?

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I would say,
first and foremost, they

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.640 align:middle line:84%
need to have some kind
of an ethical tradition

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.940 align:middle line:90%
at their back.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.080 align:middle line:84%
The way that you can tell
whether a certain teaching is

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.300 align:middle line:84%
steering you in a
good direction is

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it comports with
great ethical teachings,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the Bhagavad
Gita, whether it's

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.750 align:middle line:84%
the Gospels, whether
it's the Book of Psalms,

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to have an enduring
ethical tradition at your back.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, don't go out
and purchase a Ouija board.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.050 align:middle line:90%
That is not where you start.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:16.864 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hold back.

00:44:16.864 --> 00:44:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Hold back.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.850 align:middle line:84%
You might want to start with
some of the positive thinking

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:20.330 align:middle line:90%
ideas.

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Read Norman Vincent
Peale's book, "The Power

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.880 align:middle line:90%
of Positive Thinking."

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or Claude Bristol's.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.266 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Or Claude Bristol's,
"The Magic of Believing."

00:44:26.266 --> 00:44:28.730 align:middle line:10%
Wonderful, wonderful
ethical books.

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:31.290 align:middle line:10%
Those will expose you to
some mystical practices

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.280 align:middle line:10%
that you can use right
now in what I believe

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.170 align:middle line:10%
is an ethically sound way.

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Mitch, how do people
get a hold of you via email?

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.505 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: They can go to my
website, mitchhorowitz.com.

00:44:41.505 --> 00:44:43.720 align:middle line:10%
I am very easy to reach.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.200 align:middle line:90%
My real life e-mail is on there.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I answer everybody
who writes in.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:48.940 align:middle line:90%
A pleasure.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've given
us a great perspective

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:51.864 align:middle line:90%
of what the occult is.

00:44:51.864 --> 00:44:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've,
I think, opened up

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.800 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people's eyes.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That it might not
be as bad as people thought.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's my hope.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:44:59.840 align:middle line:90%
That's my hope.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
heard it, the occult.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you've heard about
past leaders, strange people,

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.660 align:middle line:84%
just about anybody who
dabbles with the occult.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not as evil
as you might think.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:10%
But be very careful of it.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
