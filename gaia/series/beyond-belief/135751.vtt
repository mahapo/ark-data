>>GEORGE NOORY: On
"Beyond Belief,"

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.640 align:middle line:10%
we talk about time
travel, reincarnation,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:10%
out-of-body experiences,
and parallel universes

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:10%
with none other than
Dr. Bruce Goldberg.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Bruce Goldberg,
once a practicing dentist,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:10%
is the author of more than 20
bestselling and award-winning

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:10%
books on reincarnation,
time travel,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness-raising.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Bruce has conducted more than
35,000 past-life regressions

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and future-life
progression since 1974.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
He discusses
out-of-body experiences,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.076 align:middle line:84%
parallel universes, and much
more, today on "Beyond Belief."

you've been busy.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.625 align:middle line:10%
>>BRUCE GOLDBERG:
It's a pleasure

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:10%
to reincarnate with you
every time, whether it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:10%
be radio, television, the fifth
dimension, anywhere, George.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I never
know what year I'm

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:90%
in when I'm interviewing you.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:90%
I could be in the future.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I could be in the past.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Who knows where I am with you?

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: You could
be in the 22nd century

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.913 align:middle line:10%
as Dexter Monterrey.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:10%
You can be in the 35th century
as Xeor, or you can be here.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, let's explain
that for just a second.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.084 align:middle line:84%
Dexter Monterrey-- what
year am I as that person?

00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Let's talk about
these two, because this

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:90%
is future-life progressions.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And for the audience,
what I did here

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.404 align:middle line:84%
was a technique called
accessing the Akashic records.

00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:90%
This is what a psychic does.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not a psychic,
but the techniques

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
that anyone can be
trained to do is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.800 align:middle line:84%
to access into your records of
your past, present, parallel,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:90%
and future lives.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, with you, for
your benefit, I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
decided to see what your
future lives were like.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.557 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a karmic pattern.

00:01:52.557 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing
here with your show,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:84%
both TV and radio, is
you're exposing people

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
like me, the New Age market,
the spiritual growth, et cetera,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and psychic research areas, too.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
In the future, in the 22nd
century as Dexter Monterrey,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be a host
of the equivalent of a radio

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:84%
show on something called the
GCN, the Global Communications

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Network.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.976 align:middle line:84%
300 million listeners are
going to be your audience.

00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not bad-- close
to what I have now.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.755 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You're going to
wear a one-piece gold jumpsuit,

00:02:19.755 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and people will see on their
little radio units, whatever

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.865 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent thereof, they're
going to see a hologram of you,

00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.636 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: And you're
in this big mall.

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:10%
OK, so you're going to be
on this show for 40 years.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.916 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 40 years?

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: 40 years.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:90%
You live in Texas.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is another thing.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
You do, as your own
research, your own interests,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.425 align:middle line:84%
is in psychic research and in
out-of-body experiences, OK?

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
In this life, this future
life, you're not married,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and you live in Texas.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.582 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we fast forward
to the 35th century,

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
in which you're a man
named Xeor, X-E-O-R.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
You're married to a
woman named Laura.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:90%
You have three sons.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Now you are an actual
psychic researcher.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And what you are known for, you
develop these like metal rings

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that clear the negative
energy from people.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a form of
psychic self-defense.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.627 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My invention?

00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Your invention,
which you're well known for.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
The reason why the 35th
century is relevant

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
is this is where time
travelers from the future,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:84%
the chrononauts, as
I call them, they're

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:84%
going to use teleportation
as their technique

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:90%
for going back in time.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So your cleansing
rings are used by them

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to protect them
when they teleport.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem that
you have in that life

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:84%
is that the Black
Brotherhood of Lower Astral

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Entities and these
psychic attackers,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
they're after you because you're
now going against their goal

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:90%
to try to destroy the Earth.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.613 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So you're
about to receive

00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
an award, almost like a
Nobel prize in those days,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
in the future, and they try to
attack you before the awards.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
You use your own
techniques, beat them,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:84%
so now you're even
more famous with this.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, your three
sons follow you and your work.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And listen to this.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
You live in Toronto--
we call Toronto today.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
You'll live to the age of
800 in that future life.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In real years.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: In real years, yes.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But you don't
look a day over 700.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:10%
That's good.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:84%
General George C. Patton
during World War II

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
was convinced that he was a
reincarnated general of a Roman

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:90%
era.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: A Roman
general, yes, right.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:90%
That's a very well-known story.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: George C. Scott
played Patton in the movie.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.368 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:04:18.368 --> 00:04:23.258 align:middle line:10%

00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:90%
The battlefield was here.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:84%
The Carthaginians
defending the city

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.985 align:middle line:84%
were attacked by
three Roman legions.

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
The Carthaginians were proud and
brave, but they couldn't hold.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:90%
They were massacred.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Arab women stripped them of
their tunics and their swords

00:05:24.452 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was one of my
favorite scenes from the movie,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
because if you're
into reincarnation,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.282 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, that tells
it all, doesn't it?

00:05:30.282 --> 00:05:31.656 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Not
only that, but it

00:05:31.656 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:90%
also helps with documentation.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.497 align:middle line:84%
Because when people who
have never been anywhere,

00:05:35.497 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
they recognize it,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
like this is 2,000
years after the fact,

he was able to do that campaign
in Italy in 1943 faster

than anybody expected
him to do it,

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
including Eisenhower,
because he was

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:90%
familiar with the territory.

But not in this life, in the
previous life 2,000 years ago.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How was he able
to think and recollect

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:90%
that he had been there before?

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: He did a spontaneous
regression that occurs.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Remember the case that you
had on the radio with James

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.402 align:middle line:90%
Leininger, the child?

00:06:04.402 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, the little boy.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
in May of 2000, he

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
has these nightmares
of him being

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
killed in a plane crash in
World War II as a navy pilot.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:10%
His name was James Houston in
that life-- same first name.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:10%
He looked like him, too, right?

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:10%
And he had this
spontaneous recall.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Later on, of course,
that was documented,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:90%
and they wrote a book about it.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.100 align:middle line:90%
He did interviews, et cetera.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is called a
spontaneous past-life recall.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:84%
What I tell parents, especially
mothers with their children,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
if you have a child
between two and five

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and you just say
to them, tell me

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.682 align:middle line:84%
what it was like
when you were big

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and you don't play
games with them,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
just let them be very serious,
some of these children

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
will spontaneously give you
a past-life recollection.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That's the work
of Ian Stevenson, by the way.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Can you be
trained to do that?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.461 align:middle line:10%
Well, the child doesn't
have to be trained.

00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:49.886 align:middle line:10%
It's natural for them, you see?

00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural
experience, because kids

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.887 align:middle line:84%
are very psychic when
they're between two and five.

00:06:53.887 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:84%
When they start going
into first grade

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.709 align:middle line:84%
and they start getting
socialized by society,

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
then they lose the
psychic awareness.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is fascinating.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.696 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation at
its best, isn't it?

00:07:02.696 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
the interesting thing

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
is that in the
space-time continuum,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:90%
all time is simultaneous.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So let me show you how
going into the future

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
can be relevant by
where you are right now.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I
worked with a woman.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:90%
She was a college graduate.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I call her Tammy,
not her real name.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.687 align:middle line:84%
She came to my office
in 1996 in early June.

00:07:19.687 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:84%
She just graduated from
college, lives in New York City.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.353 align:middle line:84%
She's going to go to Europe
the last half of the summer.

00:07:24.353 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And then she's going to
go to graduate school.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So she wants to
come to my office,

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:84%
because she had seen
my TV movie, my CBS

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:90%
movie about reincarnation.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to learn how to
do out-of-body experiences.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:90%
And I said, fine.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:90%
So I'm working with her.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go
out of the body,

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.269 align:middle line:90%
you're in the fifth dimension.

00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:90%
You're an ultra-terrestrial.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:90%
Remember the term.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually see
past, present, and future.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.448 align:middle line:84%
So while she's in
town for the five

00:07:44.448 --> 00:07:46.442 align:middle line:84%
days in Los Angeles
in my office,

00:07:46.442 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
she these events that are going
to occur the following day,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:90%
which actually come true.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:84%
She has like four
or five of these.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: She goes home
now, and I don't hear from her

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.344 align:middle line:90%
until the end of the month.

00:07:55.344 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
She calls me up, and she
goes, Doctor, this is Tammy.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.224 align:middle line:90%
I have a problem.

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's going on?

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:90%
You did great here.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.924 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I
used your techniques

00:08:02.924 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:90%
to go into the future.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see my trip
to Paris next month.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I see myself
taking off in a plane,

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
goes up in the air in New
York, immediately crashes.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:90%
I die.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Everybody dies.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, I don't
want to change your life here,

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:84%
but just change
your flight plans

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and call me at the
end of the summer.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.773 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Flight 800.

00:08:18.773 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Flight 800
TWA, July 17, 1996.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
She would have
been 231 of deaths.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So going into the future
and using hypnosis

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and out-of-body experiences,
not only is it not dangerous,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.013 align:middle line:84%
it's actually quite
natural, as all your dreams

00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:90%
are out-of-body experiences.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.850 align:middle line:84%
We know that from science
research in dream laboratories.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.013 align:middle line:84%
But it saved her
life-- literally.

00:08:39.013 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you talk
to her afterwards?

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:90%
She called me.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.609 align:middle line:84%
At the end of August
she called me,

00:08:43.609 --> 00:08:45.608 align:middle line:84%
and it was the end of the
summer, and she goes--

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was she in shock?

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.986 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No, no.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:84%
She didn't like that
progression that she-- I

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:90%
call it the age progression.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But she did like the fact
that her plane was fine

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:90%
when she left in July.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But she called me up to
thank me and to tell me

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that she was-- she
actually apologized

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.647 align:middle line:84%
by being so upset and so
kind of neurotic at the time.

00:09:03.647 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:90%
But I said, no, it's no problem.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she got--

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
used to that, right?

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.418 align:middle line:84%
But she got very
empowered, though,

00:09:08.418 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
because she called me about
a year and a half later.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
She was in graduate school
in a master's degree.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.403 align:middle line:90%
Everything was fine.

00:09:13.403 --> 00:09:16.057 align:middle line:84%
And she thanked me, and she
was very fulfilled in her life

00:09:16.057 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and still seeing the future
as she went out of the body.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very good
training situation,

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and she was a very
sweet young woman.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And talking about
out of the body, again,

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:84%
another great movie
called "Insidious"

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:90%
about astral projection.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:10%
>> The idea of
astral projecting,

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.407 align:middle line:10%
when you're asleep at night,
your soul or your spirit

00:09:36.407 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:10%
or whatever you want to
call it, your astral body,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.099 align:middle line:10%
leaves your physical body
and goes floating off.

00:09:41.099 --> 00:09:43.098 align:middle line:84%
This is the perfect
principle for a horror film.

00:09:43.098 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>> In the first firm, we created
this really surreal world known

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:90%
as the Further.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:90%
It has its own set of rules.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no time.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:90%
There's no space.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Into the Further we go.

00:09:53.438 --> 00:09:59.294 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.294 --> 00:10:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a place
that astral projectors,

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:84%
if they're really talented, can
actually explore this world.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
dangerous, because you

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
are mixing with people that are
dead, and you're a living soul.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.226 align:middle line:84%
And so they are attracted to
them like moths to a flame.

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I
was 11 years old,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I had an out-of-body experience.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's really the only
one I can recall.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
It was not a frightening
experience at all, Bruce.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I was bouncing on the ceiling
looking down on my little body.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.602 align:middle line:90%
But what is astral projection?

00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
astral projection

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.431 align:middle line:84%
is the old term for an
out-of-body experience.

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I
don't like the term

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.694 align:middle line:84%
is because it symbolizes
the astral plane,

00:10:34.694 --> 00:10:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and there are many other
dimensions you could go to.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.595 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But
what you're doing

00:10:38.595 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
is the soul, which is
electromagnetic radiation--

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:84%
it's pure energy, just
like a television signal,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:90%
a computer signal.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.199 align:middle line:84%
And your soul occupies
your physical body.

00:10:47.199 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So at night, especially, when
you go to sleep at night,

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
you go into the REM
cycle of a dream level.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Your soul leaves
the body at night

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.195 align:middle line:84%
every night for about
three hours, OK?

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:56.320 align:middle line:90%
We know that from research.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's healthy
for that, right?

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's perfectly--
it has to recharge

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:90%
its batteries, so to speak, OK?

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, during the waking
day, I train my patients

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:90%
to do out-of-body experiences.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.042 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I've done this
myself over 3,000 times.

00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:08.500 align:middle line:10%
So if was dangerous, we'd be
on the astral plane right now.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.806 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes, you would.

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: So the soul does
that as a natural mechanism.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously during
the waking day,

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:90%
it's harder to train people.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they're
not used to it,

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.543 align:middle line:84%
and they have too much
stress in their life.

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:19.509 align:middle line:84%
They have to kind of
relax and chill out.

00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
technique, a term

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.174 align:middle line:84%
that I use that I want to
teach your audience, too.

00:11:23.174 --> 00:11:24.230 align:middle line:90%
It's called the IBE.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a term I developed
many years ago.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.557 align:middle line:84%
It's all the characteristics
of an out-of-body experience,

00:11:29.557 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:84%
except your perspective
is from the physical body,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.671 align:middle line:90%
not from the ceiling.

00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're
using your astral senses,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:90%
your fifth-dimensional senses.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So you can see into
the fifth dimension.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.302 align:middle line:84%
You could see a ghost, so to
speak, or some other entities.

00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But your perspective is
still from the physical body.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:90%
So I call that an IBE.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're trained to
do out-of-body experiences,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.504 align:middle line:84%
you'll have the IBE first,
and then you'll have the OBE.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:10%
Like, for example,
someone in the chair,

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:10%
they may see their astral
hands rising up from the chair,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:10%
you see?

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like a
ghost almost, right?

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.451 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Right,
but that's an IBE.

00:12:00.451 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, if you
do this correctly

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:10%
and you work correctly,
and I train people

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:10%
to do that, of course, then you
can shift and actually leave,

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:10%
go onto the ceiling or travel
or go anywhere you want to do.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there this
cord that is supposed

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
to be attached between
the physical body

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.084 align:middle line:90%
and the ethereal body?

00:12:17.084 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Not
the physical body.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the silver cord.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a pulsating,
silver cord that's

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
attached from the back of the
astral or the spiritual body

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.187 align:middle line:90%
to the higher self.

00:12:28.187 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's pulsating.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
You're getting energy
from your higher self.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a regular,
out-of-body experience,

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:84%
most people don't see it
because it's behind them.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to kind of spin
around to do that or see

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:90%
somebody else's silver cord.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it will
stretch indefinitely, right?

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.401 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, but
here's the difference.

00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Between a person clinically
crosses into spirit

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.634 align:middle line:84%
or clinically dies,
that cord is severed.

00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's severed.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: So if
you a severed cord--

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.291 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like an
umbilical cord in birth.

00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:51.832 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Exactly, except it's
death rather than birth, OK?

00:12:51.832 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.048 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So if
it's severed, you

00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:56.200 align:middle line:84%
ain't coming back, is
what the point is on that.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:84%
But out-of-body experiences
are not dangerous.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.367 align:middle line:90%
They're perfectly natural.

00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can it be
severed by mistake?

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for it.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.516 align:middle line:84%
It's not like somebody has
a sword swishing around

00:13:06.516 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:90%
there and doing that.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.686 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gonna clip you.

00:13:08.686 --> 00:13:10.519 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You choose
your moment of death,

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and the death is
actually well planned.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.197 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
accidentally go out of the body

00:13:15.197 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:90%
and sever the silver cord.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:90%
That has never been recorded.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've done it
over 3,000 times.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen my own
silver cord, too.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what have you seen
when you've done your OBEs?

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, I go
into the fifth dimension.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.254 align:middle line:90%
I go to various dimensions.

00:13:26.254 --> 00:13:28.666 align:middle line:84%
I've described-- could we
spend a few seconds talking

00:13:28.666 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:90%
about the dimensions?

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: OK, you
have the astral plane.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Every dimension has
a different sound.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
The astral plane
is characterized

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.956 align:middle line:84%
by the roar of the sea, like
a sea shell to your ear.

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to
the astral plane

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.705 align:middle line:84%
to the upper, not
the lower one--

00:13:39.705 --> 00:13:41.163 align:middle line:84%
the lower one is
psychic attacking.

00:13:41.163 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The upper
would be God-like?

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.139 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It's not God-like.

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:45.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just very positive.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:90%
You have the astral museum.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
That's where Bill
Gates and Einstein went

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and Tesla and everybody else
to get futuristic technology.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
brought it back.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
that's how I developed

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.376 align:middle line:84%
my superconscious mind tape
and my progression techniques.

00:13:56.376 --> 00:13:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I went to the
astral museum, too.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
The lower astral plane is
filled with negative entities--

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to be there--
demonic entities, some bad ETs,

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:90%
reptilians.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is that what
hell would be called?

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:10%
They call it more purgatory,
would the better analogy.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Because you can get out of it.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not permanent, OK?

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the plane beyond that
is called the causal plane.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
The sound is the
tinkling of bells,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.867 align:middle line:90%
like a New Age bookstore.

00:14:15.867 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And the casual plane is where--
it's a very small plane.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.366 align:middle line:90%
It's the smallest dimension.

00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what your
Akashic records are stored.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that is the
mental plane, which

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
the sound of running
water characterizes that.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And the mental plane
has blue highways.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you're driving in
a car or flying above it

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.736 align:middle line:84%
and you see
iridescent blue roads,

00:14:32.736 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:90%
you're on the mental plane.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're on
the mental plane.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: All the entities
or the people that are there,

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.918 align:middle line:90%
they look like little angels.

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:40.749 align:middle line:84%
They live in these houses
of geometric designs.

00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And the masters
would hang out there.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.924 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhas, the
Jesus, the Moses,

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:84%
they would hang out
in the mental plane.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a very spiritual dimension.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that is
the etheric plane.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.509 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a biggie.

00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
The etheric plane is
the largest dimension.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.085 align:middle line:84%
The sound of the buzzing
bees is the characteristic.

00:14:54.085 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
I talked with you

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:84%
on the show about the
etheric plane surgeons.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a medical
issue, like cancer, AIDS,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:84%
or lupus or something
that you can't cure

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
you can do on the Earth

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
plane, the reason why
the etheric plane's

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
surgeons work well--
these are entities that

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:84%
work on the etheric
plane-- your etheric body

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is identical to
the physical body.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.190 align:middle line:84%
All the other spiritual bodies
are similar, but not exactly

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:90%
identical.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:90%
The etheric body is identical.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So these etheric surgeons
that look like giant tadpoles,

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:84%
if they work on your etheric
body and cure the etheric body,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
then it's not a high percentage,
but in certain cases,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.389 align:middle line:84%
you bring it back
to the Earth plane

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:84%
when you awaken the
following morning.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.050 align:middle line:84%
You can transfer
the healing energy.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.544 align:middle line:84%
And I've done that
with patients.

00:15:37.544 --> 00:15:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
etheric plane surgery.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.747 align:middle line:90%
It's a very ancient technique.

00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It's been around for many
years in the old mystery

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:84%
schools in ancient Greece
and Rome and Egypt.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But I've actually westernized
it for people to use.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not a high percentage,
but you've got nothing to lose,

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and when it works,
it's brilliant.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it true,
Bruce, that in the OBE state,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
most people do not
remember that they're

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:84%
in that out-of-body
state and, hence,

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
they don't remember
that they had one.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
they blank out.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:84%
The other thing they have
it's called false awakening.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're on
the astral plane,

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and you recreate your own
bedroom, which is very common.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So now you wake up, and
you say, oh, OK, I woke up.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
But you actually woke up
on the astral plane, not

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:90%
the physical plane.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But you
don't know that.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: It's called
a false awakening.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:10%
And the way you can tell that
is called a reality testing.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:10%
You can look at the
wall, and maybe the print

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.874 align:middle line:10%
of your wallpaper is
a little different

00:16:26.874 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:10%
or your alarm clock is a little
taller or smaller or wider.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Then you know you're still
on the astral plane, you see.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But most people don't remember
their nightly experiences.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
When they have dreams, sometimes
you may remember a fragment.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But remember, you're dreaming
for three hours a night.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Nobody remembers--
I'm an expert,

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and I can't remember three
hours of dreams every night.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.596 align:middle line:84%
So we tend to repress
them, because most

00:16:46.596 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:84%
of the time, people go to
the lower astral plane, which

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is very negative,
and you don't want

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.939 align:middle line:90%
to remember negative things.

00:16:51.939 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it's
a natural tendency

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
to repress the
negative experiences.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In this kind of state,
the astral state, the OBE

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:84%
state, when people
are having that done,

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:11.690 align:middle line:84%
right before you fall asleep,
you feel a jarring effect,

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:90%
something just snaps you, like.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
Is that the astral body leaving,
or is it coming back in?

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:19.369 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: OK, we have
to use couple of terms.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.159 align:middle line:84%
One is called the
hypnagogic state.

00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:24.200 align:middle line:84%
It's when you're just
like-- you're lying in bed,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.280 align:middle line:90%
you're about to fall asleep.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Normally you're in
your beta brainwave,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:84%
we call this, which is
the conscious mind proper,

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:90%
the normal conscious state.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going into alpha,
and now all of a sudden you're

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.300 align:middle line:84%
now going to transfer
from the Earth plane

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:90%
to the astral plane.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the tugging you're talking
is more on the return trip.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody feels that.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But when
you're out of the body,

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:84%
you're going to feel
like this tugging.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:84%
This is the silver cord
in the back of your head

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:90%
or some parts of the body.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Usually it's the
top of the head.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
That tugging means it's time
to go back to the Earth plane.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: So now you're
going to wake up or just

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:10%
transfer back.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:10%
So that's what that
normally means.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.580 align:middle line:10%
But when you're in
the astral plane,

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:10%
when you're in the
fifth dimension--

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:10%
let's use the word
"fifth dimension"--

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.522 align:middle line:10%
you would see a person
with like glowing--

00:18:00.522 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:10%
you know like some
of these movies,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:10%
they picture like a ghost with
like a glowing aura around it,

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.729 align:middle line:10%
like a whitish aura?

00:18:05.729 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what you see in
the fifth dimension.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.811 align:middle line:90%
You can see through the person.

00:18:08.811 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They're like-- not invisible,
but transparent, you see?

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This that why religious
paintings all have that--

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes. you
always have that.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.845 align:middle line:90%
That's why they do it.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you do.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.321 align:middle line:84%
If you look at some of
the Renaissance paintings,

00:18:18.321 --> 00:18:20.510 align:middle line:84%
you'll see some of the--
not only that, like they

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.234 align:middle line:84%
picture of Jesus or the
Virgin Mary, et cetera,

00:18:23.234 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
but you're also going to
see a lot of angel aspects.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of metaphysical
and a lot of mentalities

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:84%
towards using the
fifth dimension as part

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.149 align:middle line:84%
of their inspiration to the
artist that did that, you see.

00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:84%
You're also going to have things
in the fifth dimension-- you

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.120 align:middle line:84%
can teleport, you can fly,
you can do anything you want.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We have no physical
laws as we know it, OK?

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:90%
You can heal things.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:90%
You can do so many things.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
You can have blue breath coming
out of your mouth if you want.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Your thought
creates the reality.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:90%
But there are limitations.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
You just can't destroy
the whole dimension.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Some people think, why can't
I just nuke it, you know?

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:55.580 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are astral
police, by the way.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:10%
So if you try to do
something really stupid--

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're
there to help you?

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.370 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, they're
there to protect the others

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:10%
that you're trying to hurt.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ah, all right.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: OK?

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.340 align:middle line:10%
So there are-- it's
called the astral police.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They've got it
all sorted out, don't they?

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah, you can't
just-- because somebody would--

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
that would let someone
destroy the dimensions.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Some maniac or some
terrorist would say,

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.199 align:middle line:90%
let's just blow it up, right?

00:19:12.199 --> 00:19:13.114 align:middle line:90%
But you can't do that.

00:19:13.114 --> 00:19:14.882 align:middle line:84%
So the astral dimension
will always exist.

00:19:14.882 --> 00:19:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, one dimension I didn't
talk about, the last one,

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:90%
is the soul plane.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.530 align:middle line:84%
The soul plane is characterized
by the single note of a flute.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And what that dimension
is, it's no longer part

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:84%
of the karmic cycle,
as the other five were,

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's not part
of the higher planes.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
It's where you go when
you choose your next life.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like the DMZ,
as I call it, you see?

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you'll
ascend from that soul plane

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:90%
into the higher dimensions.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll rejoin
the God Energy

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Complex, as we call that.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.244 align:middle line:90%
So that's the purpose of life.

00:19:41.244 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
The only real purpose of life is
to ascend, to perfect your soul

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:90%
and to ascend.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Time travel--
one of my favorite topics.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Physicist Ron Mallett
has been wanting

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:84%
to develop a time machine
to go back and contact

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
his father, who he
claims he really never

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:84%
had the kind of relationship
that he wanted-- Ron Mallett.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Ever since Ron
Mallett was a boy,

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:10%
he has harbored a dream of
building a time machine.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Today, he is
professor of physics

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Connecticut
and ready to share his secret

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:90%
with the world.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:10%
>> It's really such a
powerful feeling to know that

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.450 align:middle line:10%
we're actually being able to
manipulate space and time.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's exciting,
because this shows that we

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.154 align:middle line:90%
may be able to control time.

00:20:25.154 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And that means
that ultimately, we

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:84%
may be able to control
our destiny in a way

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that mankind never has
been able to before.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Mallett's motivation began
when his father died suddenly

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:90%
of a heart attack.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Just 10 years old at the
time and totally devastated,

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Mallett made a pledge.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>> If I could build a time
machine that I could go back

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.792 align:middle line:84%
and see him again and
maybe save his life.

00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:90%
[ELECTRIC STATIC]

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>> For almost half a century
and like many other scientists,

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:84%
he has conducted his research
in closed laboratories.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, Ron
Mallett is obsessed

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
with trying to go
back into time.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Is that a smart thing to do, to
go back and save your father?

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Ron Mallett
has a specific incentive

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:10%
to do that, OK?

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:10%
Let me just discuss one thing.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:10%
If he goes back,
people say, what

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.880 align:middle line:10%
about the grandfather paradox?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.088 align:middle line:84%
If you go back in time and
you kill your grandfather,

00:21:25.088 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
you're going to disappear, the
Back to the Future mentality

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:90%
with Michael J. Fox.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
The issue here is
that when you do that,

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
you're actually going
into a parallel universe.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So even if you did go back in
time and kill your grandfather,

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:84%
you might disappear in that
universe, but not in this one.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.730 align:middle line:84%
But let me share
about the time travel,

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
because Mallet's research--
I'm well aware of his work.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:84%
There are four different
ways of time travel.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:90%
One is the physical machines.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
A man named Frank Tippler in
1974 from Tulane University

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.470 align:middle line:84%
came up with this theory
about using these rotating

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:90%
cylinders to go back in time.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Then there was Richard Gott
from Princeton University.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.520 align:middle line:84%
He has these giant,
cosmic strings,

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
which are two-dimensional
singularities

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that apparently if you go
between the two of them,

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:90%
you can go back in time.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there is Edward
Witten, also from Princeton.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:84%
He has a time-- going in
through hyper-universes and what

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.540 align:middle line:90%
we called hyperspace.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Even Kip Thorne from
Caltech University

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:90%
has a theory about that.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But his one is going to
be relevant to the future.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Because he has a theory,
wrote a scientific article

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:84%
about expanding and enlarging
wormholes into classic size

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and then lining them
with exotic matter,

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
which has negative
mass, you see.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, even
Einstein's equations

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:84%
show you can create
a time machine.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, those are the
physical methods.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:84%
The other methods
are you have what

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
we call-- what I do with the
fifth dimensional travel,

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.570 align:middle line:84%
where I take people out of
the body, like in Tammy's case

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:84%
where you can see past,
present, and future.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
You can actually see it, OK?

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Then the futuristic
time travelers

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:84%
will do the teleportation
in the 35th century.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:84%
You as Xeor will be helpful
there with your rings,

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:90%
with psychic protection.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So there are physical methods,
but the bottom line here

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:84%
is that the enlarging
wormholes to classic size

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that Kip Thorne talks about
won't be done until the year

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:84%
3050 by a man named Tatos,
who will discover time travel

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and lead to all the time
travelers from our future

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.190 align:middle line:90%
that I talk about.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:84%
The techniques-- we
don't have negative mass.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to do that
with super colliders.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.120 align:middle line:10%
They haven't done that yet.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:10%
And they won't.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:10%
So we know the mathematics,
thanks to Kip Thorne.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
the negative mass

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and the other ways of
creating this ability

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.160 align:middle line:90%
to enlarge wormholes.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
the best way to do it.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.438 align:middle line:84%
And in the future,
it's going to be

00:23:37.438 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:84%
called a wormhole linear
accelerator, developed

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.735 align:middle line:84%
by this man named Tatos,
as the first time traveler.

00:23:42.735 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, do
you think those time

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
travelers from that future
may have come back here

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:48.805 align:middle line:90%
and they're here now?

00:23:48.805 --> 00:23:50.096 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Of course they are.

00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, let me
just share the time traveler

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:90%
paradigm.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Tatos came back in time with
his wormhole linear accelerator,

00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:90%
and he had a staff.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the names of his
staff-- Geb, Isis, Osiris,

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Horus.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Egyptians.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%
They went back to
ancient Egypt first.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they
were worshipped as gods.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.395 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine coming
back in a time machine?

00:24:12.395 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
They're either going the kill
you or worship you as a god,

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Tatos was actually called
Hermes by the Greeks or Thoth

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.370 align:middle line:90%
by the Egyptians.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So he was a very, very
important character.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course, all of our
technology is given to us

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.217 align:middle line:90%
by time travelers.

00:24:25.217 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason why they're
not going to go on CNN

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:84%
or your show or the UN is
because the Men in Black

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.052 align:middle line:90%
will kill them.

00:24:33.052 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:90%
There are Men in Black.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.759 align:middle line:84%
There are different
types of Men in Black,

00:24:35.759 --> 00:24:36.920 align:middle line:90%
as I discuss in my books.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And they don't like ETs, and
they don't like time travelers.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to be-- the way you

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
meet a time traveler is
in the fifth dimension,

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Because there, they can hang
out, and the Men in Black

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:90%
can't touch them.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But when they materialize
down to the Earth plane,

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.680 align:middle line:84%
now they're exposed
and vulnerable.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they do that,
but they only do

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.550 align:middle line:84%
that when they make sure that
they're not going to be killed

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:90%
by the Men in Black, you see.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, good point.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.882 align:middle line:90%
What is a parallel universe?

00:24:58.882 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Parallel
universe is actually

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.756 align:middle line:90%
part of the fifth dimension.

00:25:01.756 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a sister universe
that is just like ours--

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:84%
we have the same physical
qualities-- except the actions

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:84%
According to
"Scientific American"--

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
they published an article
in August of 2000.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.630 align:middle line:84%
They had this whole journal
based upon parallel universes.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The closest sister universe is
less than a millimeter away.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.420 align:middle line:10%
That's 140th of an inch.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.580 align:middle line:10%
That's how close they are.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, you can't see them.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:10%
And for those of your listeners
that are more academic,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:10%
that's called the Brane theory,
B-R-A-N-E-- Brane theory.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And so parallel
universes come out

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
of Einstein's theory
of relativity.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It also came out
of mostly the work

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of Hugh Everett III
in Princeton in 1957

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
when he wrote his doctoral
thesis for quantum mechanics,

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:84%
which is quantum physics,
on the many worlds

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
interpretation,
which is basically

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.077 align:middle line:84%
the blueprint of
parallel universes.

00:25:52.077 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:90%
So they're are real.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:90%
We know they exist.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to see into them

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:90%
now with computer technology.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But parallel
universe-- so you and I

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
are on parallel
universe functioning.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:84%
You may be the
president of a country.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:90%
You may be working at a Denny's.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:90%
You can do anything you want.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of options
are different.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.796 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to look the
same, and the events that

00:26:13.796 --> 00:26:15.420 align:middle line:84%
are going to be a
little bit different.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the age
will be the same?

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Let me show you a
case of a parallel universe.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.621 align:middle line:84%
I was working with this
young teenage girl.

00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:21.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll call her Tanya.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to
about 15 years ago.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Her project was to
do a paper on 1968,

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:84%
which is a very, as you know,
tumultuous year in our history.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:90%
So she says, OK.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, she had purchased one
of my "Custom Design Your Own

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Destiny" techniques.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a CD thing.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well, I
think I'm just really going

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:84%
to go back there, and I'm
going to use Dr. Goldberg's

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:84%
techniques, and
I'm going to make

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.170 align:middle line:90%
my report a lot quicker, OK?

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.207 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes, exactly.

00:26:46.207 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: 17 years old, right?

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:10%
She goes back, and
this is what she sees.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.058 align:middle line:90%
She reports this to me.

00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:84%
She says, Doctor,
I went back there,

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and it was 1968, and
guess who was president?

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Robert F. Kennedy.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.052 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:26:58.052 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: There
was no Watergate.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:90%
There was no Nixon.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.888 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow, there
was no assassination.

00:27:01.888 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The Soviet
Union collapsed in 1986, OK?

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:90%
So this was all different.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:90%
And she knew something is wrong.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:84%
She knows she's not
in Kansas anymore.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So she comes back
out of the trance,

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and now she goes home--
this is late afternoon.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:84%
She goes down to the kitchen
to get something to eat.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Her mother who is there, and her
mother looks like her mother,

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.290 align:middle line:84%
but she's not acting
like her mother.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:84%
So she's smart
enough to realize,

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.955 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'm still in
this parallel universe.

00:27:25.955 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm in the wrong spot.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So then she goes
back and uses my CDs again

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:90%
and finally comes out of it.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And now she's back in
the regular universe.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So she for a period of
time of about two hours

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
went to a parallel universe,
where the events were

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:middle line:84%
different, but she
looked the same,

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.607 align:middle line:84%
her mother looked the same
in that second story there.

00:27:44.607 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That close.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.898 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
there are parallel

00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:49.530 align:middle line:84%
universes where the comet
hits the Earth in 1999,

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.806 align:middle line:84%
as Nostradamus, and
wipes out humanity.

00:27:51.806 --> 00:27:53.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a parallel
universe where

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.700 align:middle line:84%
the British win the American
Revolutionary War, where

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Hitler wins World War II.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:58.160 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
options out there.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Different things have changed.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Every
time you can think

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:84%
of a potential future or
potential alternative,

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.402 align:middle line:84%
you're actually creating
a parallel universe.

00:28:05.402 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:84%
There's an infinite
number of them.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce,
physicist Michio Kaku

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
has his own views of what
a parallel universe is.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at that.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:10%
>> But there are theories
which say that there could be

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:20.330 align:middle line:10%
universes right next
to our universe.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
Large Hadron Collider

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.880 align:middle line:84%
will give us the first
experimental evidence

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
about the existence
of parallel universes.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So think of us as ants
living on a sheet of paper.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps there are
other parallel sheets

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.500 align:middle line:84%
of paper with other
ants living on them.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps we are very close
to these other universes,

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:90%
but we can't reach them.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
The energy necessary to
reach a parallel universe

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:50.630 align:middle line:84%
would be the Planck energy, 10
to 19 billion electron volts.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I would suppose that
trillions of years

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:84%
from now, intelligent
life, facing

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.340 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate demise of
the universe itself,

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:03.170 align:middle line:84%
might decide to leave the
universe, to leave our universe

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and enter a parallel
universe in the same way

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:84%
that Alice entered the looking
glass to enter Wonderland.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ah, but according
to Dr. Bruce Goldberg,

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.804 align:middle line:84%
we've already gone to
other parallel universes.

00:29:16.804 --> 00:29:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, yes.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I have a technique

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:90%
called the New You technique.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.006 align:middle line:84%
When somebody comes to
my office and they say,

00:29:22.006 --> 00:29:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Doctor, I'm in trouble.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:84%
They say, my past-- they have
a criminal record or incurable

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.754 align:middle line:84%
disease or just there's
no future to them.

00:29:29.754 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing they can do.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's over.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: So what do I do?

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I say, look, suicide
is not the option.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I say, look, how
about we switch paths?

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And I train them to go
into a parallel universe,

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and remember, the universe
is still going on here,

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:84%
but their awareness
is now going to be

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.090 align:middle line:90%
in a different parallel track.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.298 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you what I did.

00:29:48.298 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:90%
I put myself in my own research.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1993ish, give or
take, the end of the year,

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I was working on a
project for a CBS TV movie

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.470 align:middle line:90%
with a writer and a producer.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And this was done by CBSP, the
internal production company.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And the writer told me,
he said, Doctor, he says,

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:04.400 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to air.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.858 align:middle line:84%
They've authorized
some treatments,

00:30:05.858 --> 00:30:08.100 align:middle line:90%
but the project is dead.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After all their work.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.784 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: I said, I'll fix it.

00:30:10.784 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, they
don't want to hear from you.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:14.866 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm not going
to call the network.

00:30:14.866 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use one of
my strange techniques.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened was I
used my "New You" technique.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I went into the future, OK?

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I scanned the whole thing
for about 20 years or so.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the movie was
going to air in at least one

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.784 align:middle line:90%
of those frequencies.

00:30:30.784 --> 00:30:33.200 align:middle line:84%
But I saw many other things
that happened to me personally

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and professionally
that had nothing

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.350 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't possibly know.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out,
I switched tracks,

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.179 align:middle line:84%
went to that-- this is
this parallel universe, OK?

00:30:42.179 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And many of the things-- people
I would have met, personally,

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.290 align:middle line:84%
social life, professional
life-- you were involved, OK?

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't know who
you were at the time, right?

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.653 align:middle line:90%
This is 1994. [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:51.653 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
know me then, yeah.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So I'm the example
of switching, of parallel--

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.346 align:middle line:84%
now, the other universe
I left is still going on.

00:30:59.346 --> 00:31:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I have no contact
with it, right?

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, just like you don't
know what's going on

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:03.780 align:middle line:90%
in all the parallel universes.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But this gentleman I'm talking
about, he was now in a universe

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:84%
where things are
quite different.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.340 align:middle line:84%
One example that relates to
you because of your origin

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:16.020 align:middle line:84%
of Detroit, I was working
with the woman who was-- she

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.300 align:middle line:84%
was in her 60s, and her
husband was retiring.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.380 align:middle line:90%
And she lived in Detroit.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.276 align:middle line:90%
She's from Detroit.

00:31:20.276 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And she just wanted
to get out of town,

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to move, and
they had so many problems.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So she goes into
the future, and she

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.180 align:middle line:90%
sees herself moving to Florida.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.055 align:middle line:84%
Her husband is going to
get a consulting job,

00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
going to be fine.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But in the universe
that she's in now,

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.269 align:middle line:84%
she sees into the future
about Christmastime.

00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:38.560 align:middle line:84%
She's going to get shot and
killed in downtown Detroit.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: So now she's got
incentive to switch, right?

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which could
happen, by the way.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.230 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, I know.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:44.700 align:middle line:90%
So she has incentive to switch.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, let's do
the switching, right?

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:90%
So now she switches.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, oh, about six or eight
months later, she contacts me,

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and she goes, Doctor, she
goes, we moved to Florida,

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.822 align:middle line:84%
everything came
true as relevant.

00:31:56.822 --> 00:31:58.530 align:middle line:84%
But she goes, I gotta
tell you something.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.390 align:middle line:84%
She kept in touch with
the Detroit newspapers.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Her family was
there, so she-- you

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
know how you can get
out-of-town papers?

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.149 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: The very day she
was to be shot and killed

00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:10%
in downtown Detroit,
somebody else

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.944 align:middle line:10%
was shot and killed on
the exact same spot.

00:32:09.944 --> 00:32:10.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In her place.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.926 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: In her place.

00:32:11.926 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's not her fault.
I'm just showing you

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.790 align:middle line:10%
how the universe works.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: OK?

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people have
seen their doppelganger,

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.786 align:middle line:90%
an image of themselves--

00:32:21.786 --> 00:32:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh,
no, it's actually

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.080 align:middle line:90%
a physical representation.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.163 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physical
representation wandering around.

00:32:26.163 --> 00:32:28.125 align:middle line:84%
Is that someone from
a parallel universe?

00:32:28.125 --> 00:32:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.395 align:middle line:84%
A doppelganger--
let me show you.

00:32:30.395 --> 00:32:32.380 align:middle line:84%
The doppelganger is
a Scandinavian term,

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.220 align:middle line:90%
a German term.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.190 align:middle line:84%
What this means is
that if you have

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.010 align:middle line:84%
your astral body, your spiritual
body, it looks like a ghost,

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:39.810 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But if
you condense it-- this

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
is astral matter-- then it
becomes a doppelganger, where

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.290 align:middle line:90%
you can shake hands with it.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.902 align:middle line:84%
And there are
examples of people who

00:32:48.902 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:84%
have-- like there's a
classic case in New York.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:84%
There was a physician
who was going

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to give a talk, a medical
conference, a dinner meeting,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.010 align:middle line:90%
It's in New York City, OK?

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But he's also seen and
witnessed in Toronto

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.717 align:middle line:84%
on the exact same day
giving the exact same talk.

00:33:04.717 --> 00:33:06.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't be in two
places at the same time.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.758 align:middle line:84%
But the most famous case
occurred in England, though,

00:33:08.758 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:84%
about 1905, where a member
of the House, their House

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:90%
of Commons, their lower house.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.100 align:middle line:84%
He was sick at
home with the flu,

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.370 align:middle line:90%
and he had his nurse there.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.340 align:middle line:84%
He had a doctor there and a
whole bunch of people there.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.215 align:middle line:84%
Yet his doppelganger voted
in the House of Commons.

00:33:24.215 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was already there.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
it's public record.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
it was witnessed.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people
who witnessed him

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.610 align:middle line:84%
became the prime minister
of England a couple of years

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:31.330 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.095 align:middle line:90%
How's that for credibility?

00:33:32.095 --> 00:33:32.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:33:32.895 --> 00:33:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Are doppelgangers the
opposite of your personality?

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.120 align:middle line:90%
If you're good, it's bad?

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No, no, no, no.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.370 align:middle line:90%
This isn't-- no.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:84%
The doppelganger
is actually you.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just-- you
may weigh a little less.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.920 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLING] But no,
it's going to have

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.274 align:middle line:90%
the same personality as you.

00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:48.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've got some
e-mails for you, Bruce.

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:49.330 align:middle line:10%
Let's go through a couple.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:10%
John from Columbia,
Maryland, wants to know,

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:53.930 align:middle line:10%
is the future fixed?

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No, of course not.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Quantum mechanics and
any of the theories,

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.194 align:middle line:84%
you have what we call
a plastic future.

00:33:59.194 --> 00:34:01.360 align:middle line:84%
You can change-- just like
Tammy changed her future.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.260 align:middle line:84%
If the future was fixed,
Tammy would be dead

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:90%
on TWA Flight 800, right?

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So the future is-- now,
there are other futures

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.280 align:middle line:90%
where you may not do very well.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Just don't use
those frequencies.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Stay in the ones
that you are cool.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:84%
But the future is
always changeable,

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.080 align:middle line:84%
because we, our
actions or inactions,

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.580 align:middle line:84%
determine what the
actual future is.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So we can control that.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You can
always control it.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.210 align:middle line:10%
Can't control the past, but
you can control the future.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Mary from one of
your favorite spots, Ithaca,

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:28.929 align:middle line:10%
New York, what is a
psychic empowerment?

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:31.256 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well she's
referring to the main technique

00:34:31.256 --> 00:34:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I deal with in my practice.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Empowerment means taking
charge of your life.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And in my superconscious mind
tap technique with hypnosis,

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm using your
psychic abilities,

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:84%
your connection from
the subconscious mind

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
or the soul to your
perfect counterpart,

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.480 align:middle line:84%
called the higher self
or the superconscious,

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.850 align:middle line:84%
to raise the soul's
energy to a higher level.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.345 align:middle line:84%
So you can be more confident,
more empowered, fearless,

00:34:51.345 --> 00:34:52.389 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.593 align:middle line:84%
That's what I call
psychic empowerment.

00:34:54.593 --> 00:34:56.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, and Derald
in Orlando, Florida,

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:10%
explain the best way
to use the techniques

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:10%
that you teach in
our daily lives

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.556 align:middle line:10%
to get into parallel universes
or time travel or OBEs.

00:35:05.556 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
very simple-- I mean,

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.980 align:middle line:10%
I have obviously lots of CDs
on my site they can check out.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.020 align:middle line:84%
But you practice some form
of hypnosis on a daily basis.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.354 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have various techniques.

00:35:15.354 --> 00:35:17.270 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do out
of body, obviously there

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:90%
are out-of-body CDs.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.650 align:middle line:84%
If he wants to see
a parallel universe,

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:23.470 align:middle line:84%
the "New You" technique on the
Destiny program is relevant.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So any of these subdivisions
that he wants to do,

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:30.731 align:middle line:84%
you just use the techniques on a
regular basis without pressure.

00:35:30.731 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:10%
And for the benefit
of the audience,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.070 align:middle line:10%
please, no drugs, no
recreational drugs.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:36.910 align:middle line:10%
I know pot is legal
in California now

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:38.290 align:middle line:10%
and a bunch of other states.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:10%
Don't do it.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:10%
You're going to go to
a lower astral plane.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:40.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.420 align:middle line:10%
Does it affect you?

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: You'll go to the
lower astral plane every time.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:43.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It will.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.350 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: And you will meet
all the negative entities

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:48.515 align:middle line:10%
that you see in cartoons.

00:35:48.515 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be there.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't want
to be there at all.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.006 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You want
to do it naturally.

00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And in my books, I describe
the many techniques

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:84%
they can do about
relaxing in your home,

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.810 align:middle line:84%
wearing light clothing,
doing it late at night

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.660 align:middle line:84%
is good for the beginning
because that's natural.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Don't eat a lot of food,
especially red meat,

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:05.125 align:middle line:90%
before you're doing it.

00:36:05.125 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
techniques about how

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.971 align:middle line:84%
to set up your environment
and your home, wherever

00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:90%
you're going to do this.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's a natural technique,
but you want to do it relaxed.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And interesting enough,
there's a technique.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.270 align:middle line:84%
The sound of the Earth
plane is a thunderstorm.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want to
do it during a storm.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not dangerous, but it's
like you're swimming upstream.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.100 align:middle line:84%
You want to do it
when there's no--

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
great sound, though.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.784 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's a
great sound, but not

00:36:25.784 --> 00:36:27.400 align:middle line:90%
for out-of-body training.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have there
ever been cases

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
of somebody leaving
their body and not

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:90%
being able to come back?

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Never.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Never has anyone-- and I'm
familiar with the literature.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You know I contribute to
the scientific literature.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've done this
over 3,000 times.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:84%
There has never
been a case, ever

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:45.086 align:middle line:84%
in recorded history, going
back to the Greeks, the Romans,

00:36:45.086 --> 00:36:46.220 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptians, you name it.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.240 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a case where
anybody has ever been harmed

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.840 align:middle line:90%
by going out of the body.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But there is the
opposite, where people

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.830 align:middle line:84%
have been helped and healed and
cured and empowered and done

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:59.320 align:middle line:84%
all kinds-- let me tell you a
technique about out-of-body.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:90%
It's called astral negotiation.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.770 align:middle line:10%
Let's say you're having
a problem with someone--

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: With an individual.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.093 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Anyone in your
family-- anyone, your family,

00:37:06.093 --> 00:37:08.169 align:middle line:10%
your friends, family,
personal life.

00:37:08.169 --> 00:37:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So what you can do is you
go to the astral plane.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Or let's use the upper
astral plane as an example.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:84%
You create what's called a
sanctuary, like a conference

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.920 align:middle line:90%
room in the fifth dimension.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:84%
You now summon the
soul of the person

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.340 align:middle line:90%
you're having problems with.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.587 align:middle line:90%
They have to show up.

00:37:21.587 --> 00:37:23.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to stay,
but they have to show up.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.810 align:middle line:90%
This is not black magic.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:25.950 align:middle line:90%
This is natural.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.237 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
if they stay with you,

00:37:28.237 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:84%
you can now work out
your differences,

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:84%
you can do a
negotiation with them,

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and they on the earth plane
won't know what's going on,

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:36.000 align:middle line:90%
because they're asleep now.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.518 align:middle line:84%
So now you're doing
the negotiation,

00:37:37.518 --> 00:37:39.726 align:middle line:84%
and then when they wake up
the following morning, all

00:37:39.726 --> 00:37:40.810 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, it's
going to be, you know,

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.660 align:middle line:84%
maybe I shouldn't
be such a creep

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:90%
to that person now or whatever.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:45.720 align:middle line:90%
And I've had people--

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's magical.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.863 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I've
used this with people

00:37:47.863 --> 00:37:51.007 align:middle line:84%
to get a job when they were
working with an HR person

00:37:51.007 --> 00:37:52.590 align:middle line:84%
where they're going
to be interviewed.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with people who were
about to get fired from a job

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.016 align:middle line:84%
because they were
having problems.

00:37:56.016 --> 00:37:57.789 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with people
who have problems

00:37:57.789 --> 00:37:58.830 align:middle line:90%
with their relationships.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:01.080 align:middle line:90%
They're about to get divorced.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Any interaction, you
can negotiate anything.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they don't want
to do it, that's fine.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.812 align:middle line:84%
But you've got nothing
to lose, again.

00:38:10.812 --> 00:38:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've done this
myself, and I've

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:84%
worked with thousands
of patients doing this.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did Dr.
Bruce Goldberg, a dentist,

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.447 align:middle line:90%
get involved in all of this?

00:38:19.447 --> 00:38:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
I'll make the very--

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.880 align:middle line:84%
it's called the two cents
plain version of this.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.460 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Baltimore--
I was in dental school--

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I was working very long, hard
hours, like in summertime.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I was a security guard.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was very tired one
day, and literally a voice

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.560 align:middle line:84%
came into my head
and said, go down

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to the Aquarian Age
bookstore downtown,

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:41.640 align:middle line:90%
which is a New Age bookstore.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.635 align:middle line:84%
And I figure, oh,
look, I'm tired.

00:38:43.635 --> 00:38:45.120 align:middle line:84%
All right, what
have I got to lose?

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So I go down there, and I see
this beautiful Greek goddess

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:90%
woman.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.710 align:middle line:84%
She's about 6 and 1/2
feet tall with her hair

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.680 align:middle line:84%
up in a bun, blond hair,
wearing a Greek toga.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Real?

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Real woman.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And she says to
me-- I don't know

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.920 align:middle line:84%
who this woman is-- she says to
me, I've been waiting for you.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:10%
And I looked at her,
and I said, I've

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.230 align:middle line:10%
been waiting for
you all my life.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.105 align:middle line:10%
What's going on here?

00:39:05.105 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHING]

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.780 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: So she
says, come back

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.220 align:middle line:10%
into the back of the
bookstore with me.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, here you go.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I have
no fears, right?

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I go back there and--

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Family show,
by the way, Bruce.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: She reaches up,
and she pulls out a book,

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.534 align:middle line:90%
"The Search for Bridey Murphy."

00:39:17.534 --> 00:39:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you remember
this, Bridey Murphy

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.690 align:middle line:90%
was a case in the 1950s.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:21.960 align:middle line:90%
A man named Maury Bernstein--

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great case.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.558 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --who later
became a good friend of mine,

00:39:24.558 --> 00:39:25.740 align:middle line:90%
the late Maury Bernstein.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was like 1952, '53,
he worked with this woman,

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:84%
turned into a
documented case called

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Bridey Murphy, a
woman from Ireland

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.879 align:middle line:90%
that was from a past life.

00:39:33.879 --> 00:39:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And this got a lot of
attention nationally.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic church
was against it.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.690 align:middle line:84%
There was movies and
plays made out of it.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:90%
It was a big thing.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at that,
and I said, you

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.380 align:middle line:84%
know, I want to use hypnosis
in my dental practice anyway,

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.600 align:middle line:84%
so I decided to-- I think,
what have I got to lose?

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, then I started
experimenting with regression.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:90%
And then it worked.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I was able to work with people
with solving major problems.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I went from regression
to developing progression

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:55.710 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote my first book,
"Past Lives, Future Lives."

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I worked
with ET abductees

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and out-of-body experiences and
then teleportation experiences.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the ultimate is
working with the time travelers.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.700 align:middle line:10%
So it became a
circuitous path where

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.080 align:middle line:10%
the universe was kind of
guiding me and saying, come on.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.394 align:middle line:10%
We've got a little bit more
here, a little bit more.

00:40:14.394 --> 00:40:15.560 align:middle line:10%
And that's where I am today.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm glad you did.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.319 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, for people who
want to get a hold of you,

00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:90%
where do they go?

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.540 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: They can
go to my website, DR--

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.820 align:middle line:10%
that's for doctor--
drbrucegoldberg.com.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.590 align:middle line:10%
If they want to call
my toll-free number,

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:31.680 align:middle line:10%
1-800-KARMA-4-U, 1-800-527-6248.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And if they mention
this show, they're

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.095 align:middle line:84%
going to get a special
free gift from me.

00:40:35.095 --> 00:40:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: My pleasure.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've interviewed Dr.
Goldberg for 14 years now.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:47.010 align:middle line:10%
And every time, he
brings a new perspective

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:52.440 align:middle line:10%
to time travel, reincarnation,
parallel universes, OBEs--

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.330 align:middle line:10%
just a fascinating subject.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:55.950 align:middle line:10%
Practice it.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:middle line:10%
You will open up many
doors that you never

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.380 align:middle line:10%
thought you would open.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."
