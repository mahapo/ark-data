[Background Music]

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.114 align:middle line:84%
And I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.384 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

uncover what really happened.

was watching me.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.957 align:middle line:84%

all the information.

[ Music ]

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.769 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.873 align:middle line:84%
You know, since the beginning of
time, mankind has been obsessed

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.876 align:middle line:84%
with trying to communicate
with the dead.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.277 align:middle line:90%
But how do they do that?

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.513 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is one
such item out there

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.648 align:middle line:90%
and it's called the Ouija Board.

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:51.852 align:middle line:84%
Karen Dahlman, noted author,
will tell you about some

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:56.056 align:middle line:84%
of her works in moment
is a Ouija board-ologist.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.091 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is that, Karen?

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Karen Dahlman: Ouijaologist
is somebody who works

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.529 align:middle line:84%
at the boards and
understands how to use to it.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.297 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
how do you use it?

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Karen Dahlman: Well, I used
the board for only one purpose

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.069 align:middle line:84%
and the purpose is for spiritual
development and growth.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.272 align:middle line:84%
So I make sure that always used
under those kind of auspices.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.307 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, you
wrote "The Spirit of Creativity"

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.177 align:middle line:84%
and "The Spirits of
Ouija," two books.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.845 align:middle line:90%
They are both different.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:23.650 align:middle line:84%
One deals more with the
inner spirituality of people,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
the other one deals
with the Ouija board.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
How can somebody
be so different?

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Karen Dahlman: Well, that's
a good way of putting it.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.059 align:middle line:90%
Yet, they are every similar.

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:35.729 align:middle line:84%
When I was writing
the first book,

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.297 align:middle line:84%
"The Spirit of Creativity,"
I actually was consulting

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:84%
with the Ouija board,
my spirit friends

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.235 align:middle line:90%
on some topics to write about.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:45.238 align:middle line:84%
So this book came with the
topics that I was working

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:49.208 align:middle line:84%
on with Ouija board,
meaning personal development,

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.878 align:middle line:90%
learning to access creativity,

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:55.148 align:middle line:84%
learning to evolve myself,
become better person.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:58.218 align:middle line:84%
So when I wrote "The
Spirits of Ouija" for decades

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.153 align:middle line:84%
of communication, that's
really what was going

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.255 align:middle line:84%
on behind the scenes
while I wrote this book.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:05.058 align:middle line:84%
So really what's been going on
behind the scenes for 40 years

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.294 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote this book and
beyond because it talks

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:10.029 align:middle line:84%
about how to go more
internally with yourself,

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.332 align:middle line:84%
that spirits actually,
our guides are here

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.868 align:middle line:84%
to help us become more
powerful in our self,

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.269 align:middle line:90%
not to go outside our self.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.773 align:middle line:84%
Although Ouija board seems like
a tool for outside ourselves,

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
it's really a tool to
help you go back within

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.512 align:middle line:84%
and learn great things about
your talents, who you are,

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.981 align:middle line:84%
capabilities, abilities,
and those kinds of things.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.082 align:middle line:90%
They go hand in hand.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:29.783 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Now the board,
the board is really

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.251 align:middle line:90%
controversial because--

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.619 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Oh, yeah.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.788 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- because there are some
people out that swear by it.

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:37.924 align:middle line:84%
There are other people
who swear at it basically.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:40.694 align:middle line:84%
They want nothing
to do with that.

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.028 align:middle line:90%
How old is the Ouija board?

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.263 align:middle line:90%
How did it first start?

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.698 align:middle line:90%
Who developed it?

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:45.899 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, those are
some good questions

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.935 align:middle line:84%
because the Ouija board,
as we know it, the Ouija,

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
it's actually pronounced
Ouija, not Ouiji, is from 1891

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.442 align:middle line:84%
and in 1890, they
filed patent on it.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And 1891 is when the
patent was granted

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.512 align:middle line:84%
by the United States
Patent Office.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.914 align:middle line:90%
And it started being made.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.917 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were spirit
boards and maybe other kinds

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
of devices they use, the
alphabet cards they use is one

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.522 align:middle line:84%
or a board that had
letters on or numbers.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:12.225 align:middle line:84%
And people would point to it
or use other kinds of devices.

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:16.129 align:middle line:84%
And that's about mid-1800s
when spiritualist movement came

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.697 align:middle line:90%
about in the United States.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.033 align:middle line:84%
People are wanting
a way to communicate

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.502 align:middle line:84%
with their loved ones
that were beyond.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.273 align:middle line:84%
So when this board came out,
this item which is very unique

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:29.609 align:middle line:84%
because it took a planchette
which is this item right here

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.612 align:middle line:84%
which they usually used with
their hand on it and a pencil,

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:35.482 align:middle line:84%
it was an aperture for a pencil,
and had two caster wheels,

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.417 align:middle line:84%
and they roll around
and they would write.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:41.087 align:middle line:84%
They'd write these phenomenal
messages from the beyond.

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:43.556 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was they
took this, retrofitted it,

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.826 align:middle line:84%
if you will, took off the pencil
and ended up with three legs.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.828 align:middle line:84%
They could be wooden or
they could be casters.

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:51.197 align:middle line:84%
And they put it, they
call it the little table

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:52.599 align:middle line:84%
and they put it on
top the board.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.136 align:middle line:84%
And this here is a
1902 board circa, 1902.

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh, this is old.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.471 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure I want to hold it.

00:03:58.471 --> 00:03:59.306 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: You touched it.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:00.073 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I don't want to hold it.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: You touched it.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.474 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Bad luck.

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.442 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: So that-- no, goodness,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
this is really good
luck actually.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.911 align:middle line:84%
So this would go on
top of it like this.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.514 align:middle line:84%
And it will roll around so
they got rid of the pencil.

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
The writing which was
awfully, most of the time,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.786 align:middle line:84%
became really eligible
and scribbly when speaking

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
of more concise, exact
way, quick way of being

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.158 align:middle line:90%
in contact with the beyond.

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:21.328 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did they think that
the people that were holding

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:24.197 align:middle line:84%
down the planchette were
just playing a game,

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.033 align:middle line:84%
just playing around,
maybe making it up?

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.302 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I'm sure there was
a lot back in then too.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:32.005 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a tool
that's been around, you know,

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.374 align:middle line:90%
again since about 1890s

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and it was really popular
in the early 1900s.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.745 align:middle line:90%
In fact, every home had one.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.714 align:middle line:84%
It was a parlor game,
if you will.

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:41.748 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.516 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Before radio,
before television.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:44.451 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.285 align:middle line:84%
You sit around the
Ouija, I guess,

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:90%
instead-- Ouija instead, right?

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.757 align:middle line:84%
So it was used as a tool
to communicate but yet,

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.892 align:middle line:84%
it was also a parlor
game as well.

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:55.562 align:middle line:84%
There was no negativity
connotation

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:57.464 align:middle line:90%
or association with it.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.866 align:middle line:84%
So it was something that
every household almost had.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.001 align:middle line:90%
It was like Kleenex.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.402 align:middle line:84%
You know, they give
it household name.

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.804 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why we
call all talking boards

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:08.041 align:middle line:84%
or spirit boards Ouija,
Ouija boards, because it's

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.876 align:middle line:84%
like Kleenex, you know,
it's the same thing.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:13.847 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I wonder if [inaudible]
would come over to your house

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:18.351 align:middle line:84%
and everybody would play with
Ouija board and after she left,

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:20.286 align:middle line:84%
if something would
happen to her.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:23.156 align:middle line:84%
Maybe her horse and
carriage went crazy and--

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.158 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, people like to
associate stories like that,

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.627 align:middle line:84%
which I think it gives it more
of a mystic and mysteriousness

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
about it and it makes it
exciting and fun and tantalizing

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.565 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
kind of drive.

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:35.101 align:middle line:84%
Ouija is scary but
yet is mysterious

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and there might be some
interesting information.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.705 align:middle line:90%
Sure, people a lot of--

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:41.541 align:middle line:84%
I've heard over the years
people had made associations.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.977 align:middle line:84%
And I would say yes,
things can happen.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.712 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to say they can't,

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.447 align:middle line:84%
but things can happen
with anything.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:50.917 align:middle line:84%
It's not outside myself, it's
not this that makes it happen.

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:53.286 align:middle line:84%
It's the people themselves,
it's their own energy.

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.387 align:middle line:90%
It's their own life.

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:56.423 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy around
them, it's not this.

00:05:56.423 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I could draw letters on
this table right here,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.595 align:middle line:84%
put my planchette on it,
and would probably move.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:04.597 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the
board, it's not the table.

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:06.032 align:middle line:90%
It would be me behind it.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.134 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How did you
get involved in this?

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:10.503 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, it was a
gift from Santa Claus.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:11.538 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Nice Santa Claus.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.239 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Isn't that a great gift?

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.073 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Bad Santa.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:15.074 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: You know, good Santa.

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:16.776 align:middle line:84%
It was what I wanted
and I got it

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:18.344 align:middle line:84%
and I've been doing
it ever since.

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:21.915 align:middle line:84%
So what happen was, I was
involved with some friends

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:25.185 align:middle line:84%
down the street, two
girls that were sisters.

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:28.421 align:middle line:84%
And I went to their house and
they had one of these boards.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.557 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen one before,
didn't know much about it.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:31.691 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did you fall
in love with it?

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.726 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I will tell you I
did because immediately,

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.028 align:middle line:84%
we start talking
to a dead sister.

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:37.163 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know they
had a dead sister.

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:38.832 align:middle line:84%
There's a twin of
one of the girls.

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:41.067 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "Wait a
second," I was not pushing it

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.836 align:middle line:84%
but I thought they
must be pushing it.

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:44.137 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm not.

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.271 align:middle line:90%
They swore they weren't.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:46.906 align:middle line:84%
And then we started to
find out other things

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.242 align:middle line:84%
and I thought this is just
too strange and here I am,

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:52.378 align:middle line:84%
eight years old, thinking
this weird, I was so excited.

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:54.314 align:middle line:84%
I immediately ran home
to tell my parents

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:56.349 align:middle line:90%
about this marvelous tool.

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:57.283 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You had to have one.

00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:58.451 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: I have to have one.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.753 align:middle line:90%
So for about-- before I got one

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
for several months,
I was using theirs.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.494 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And when you started
with it, did you do it

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:08.761 align:middle line:90%
by yourself for a while?

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.129 align:middle line:90%
And did it work?

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.832 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I never-- no, I
never did it by myself.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:15.535 align:middle line:84%
I always believe that you
shouldn't do that by yourself

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:19.272 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like you are
getting yourself into energy.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.807 align:middle line:84%
And you really need
somebody to be there with you

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.876 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to start to
work with energy on this level.

00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:26.746 align:middle line:84%
Meaning you're moving in and
beyond our reality and going

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:28.648 align:middle line:84%
into another realm that we
may not know too much how

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.985 align:middle line:84%
to traverse it, and you got to
know how to navigate this space.

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:33.319 align:middle line:90%
So I say don't, I never did.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.688 align:middle line:84%
I never did and I don't
recommend anybody starting

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
out with Ouija board to
do it on their own either.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.993 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How do you
recommend people use it?

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:41.227 align:middle line:90%
Not that we're endorsing it.

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:42.462 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, are we
going to use it maybe?

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.129 align:middle line:90%
I could show you.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.963 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You can.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.698 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: I wouldn't do by myself.

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:48.601 align:middle line:84%
How you use it is
you want have a--

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:51.204 align:middle line:90%
you want to approach the board

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
with definitely a
sense of revere.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.743 align:middle line:84%
You want to approach it as
if it's sacred in the space

00:07:56.743 --> 00:08:00.013 align:middle line:84%
of "I'm going to use this
tool," a tool only it's a tool,

00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:01.948 align:middle line:84%
"to open up and talk
to the other side."

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.351 align:middle line:84%
So you want to come to it not
frivolously, not jovially,

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:08.621 align:middle line:84%
but has seriousness about
it and openness to it

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:09.989 align:middle line:90%
and allow the spirits to talk.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:13.092 align:middle line:84%
It requires a lot of energy
on their end to be able

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:16.296 align:middle line:84%
to match the frequency and the
vibration of our energy to come

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.064 align:middle line:90%
through and even communicate.

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:22.835 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, if you have it on
an open, honest, authentic level

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:25.939 align:middle line:84%
and you welcomed to come
to that kind of level,

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:28.341 align:middle line:84%
the same quality level you're
putting out, then it's going

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.742 align:middle line:84%
to be easier for
them to talk to you.

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:32.645 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend you do it that
way with a prayer to start,

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.979 align:middle line:90%
always with a prayer to start.

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:34.514 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: A prayer?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.348 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.616 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What kind of a prayer?

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.517 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: A prayer where you
honor yourself doing this,

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.154 align:middle line:84%
opening yourself up and
ask for the God's source

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
of the white light, you
know, whatever works for you

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.491 align:middle line:90%
in terms of your protection.

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:46.693 align:middle line:90%
You bring in protection.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.329 align:middle line:84%
I used to call the God's
source of the white light.

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:51.497 align:middle line:84%
And I bring that in, I make
sure it's protecting myself

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:54.934 align:middle line:84%
and surrounding me, because
I'm going into another realm,

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:58.605 align:middle line:90%
it's like a shaman journey.

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:00.139 align:middle line:84%
I'm journeying into the
other realm and allowing them

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:01.808 align:middle line:90%
to comeback with me too.

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:04.077 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to be really
set the stage for that,

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:06.546 align:middle line:84%
has seriousness, has
sacredness to it.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.615 align:middle line:84%
And then welcome
that sacredness back.

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:11.985 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: When you use it, are you
conjuring up a certain spirit?

00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:13.853 align:middle line:90%
Like somebody you knew?

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:17.657 align:middle line:84%
Or do you just open it up and
let anything come through?

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:19.259 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, I don't
really like the word conjure

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:20.827 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell why I don't
like to use that word.

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:23.296 align:middle line:84%
'Cause it sounds like
I'm practicing some kind

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:24.998 align:middle line:90%
of magic or cult practice.

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what I'm doing
here and I don't really want

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.736 align:middle line:84%
to say I even involved, I
don't even know how to do that.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.571 align:middle line:90%
So I don't use the word conjure.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.707 align:middle line:84%
I would say I am invoking, I
know it sounds kind of somatics.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:38.745 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm doing is I'm asking
permission for another energy

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.146 align:middle line:90%
to come through and speak to me.

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:43.683 align:middle line:84%
But I do have energies I talk
to and they're all related to me

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:46.519 align:middle line:84%
in some level in terms
of a guardian or a guide.

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.354 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are
discarnate spirits.

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:51.524 align:middle line:84%
That means they've never
been born in physical form.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.593 align:middle line:84%
And I have angels
I talk to as well.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.062 align:middle line:84%
Those I've met over the
years, and I only met them

00:09:56.062 --> 00:10:00.299 align:middle line:84%
because I set the stage for the
seriousness and the white light

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:01.401 align:middle line:84%
so that's all that
can come through.

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:03.803 align:middle line:84%
Everything that comes
through this portal,

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:07.507 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call the portal
or doing this type of work,

00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:11.177 align:middle line:84%
it's really important that you
have that energy, and you hold

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:12.378 align:middle line:90%
that space for that energy,

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
the same to come
through that you are.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.849 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really serious
about that so what I meet

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and who I meet are
those types of energies.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.952 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I see.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.388 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, [inaudible]
but I will speak to people

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.557 align:middle line:84%
who are dead or passed on
because somebody who has come

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:29.095 align:middle line:84%
to the session that I'm
hosting has some unsolved,

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:32.432 align:middle line:84%
unfinished business and they
need closure so I'm willing to

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:34.167 align:middle line:84%
and I want to help people
have closure on that.

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.269 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, who's the one that
helps bring that spirit in?

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.272 align:middle line:84%
You or that individual
who has come to you?

00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:42.975 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Both, I mean, this energy
coming here and their desire,

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.244 align:middle line:84%
their openness to
speak to that energy,

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:49.015 align:middle line:84%
as well as myself being open and
desiring and knowing how to open

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:51.351 align:middle line:84%
that portal, that
channel to use it,

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:53.653 align:middle line:84%
as well as the entity
on the other side.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.188 align:middle line:84%
Now, just because
somebody wants to speak

00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:57.724 align:middle line:84%
to let's say a dead
loved one doesn't mean

00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:84%
that loved one will
come through.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.528 align:middle line:84%
They may not be able
to at that moment.

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:05.998 align:middle line:84%
They may still be on the other
side healing from their death.

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:84%
There may be some work
they're working on.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.936 align:middle line:84%
I mean, life goes
on the other side.

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:12.472 align:middle line:84%
And there-- they have
work to do there.

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:15.041 align:middle line:84%
But they'll come through if
they're able to, and if not,

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:84%
typically, a guardian
of that person

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.979 align:middle line:84%
or another message
barrier will come through.

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have helpers, bouncers,
gatekeepers if you will,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.687 align:middle line:84%
on the other side who help bring
through the energies that need

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.288 align:middle line:90%
to come through and speak.

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:32.859 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What if they've already
reincarnated, if you believe

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:35.595 align:middle line:84%
in reincarnation,
does that mean then

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:37.864 align:middle line:90%
that you cannot contact them?

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:38.998 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yes.

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:39.832 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Because that soul
has already comeback,

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:90%
it's in another physical body.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.201 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: That's correct.

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.403 align:middle line:84%
Now-- but let's get
complicated here, OK?

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:45.471 align:middle line:90%
Let's make this more complex.

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.305 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's true.

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:47.907 align:middle line:90%
I'll say yes to that question.

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:50.109 align:middle line:84%
Yet I do want to say
that you can talk

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:52.912 align:middle line:90%
to people's higher selves, OK?

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:55.248 align:middle line:84%
So I spent just three and a half
years and that's in my new book

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:57.717 align:middle line:84%
where it talked about-- I'm
talking to higher selves.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.752 align:middle line:84%
This-- it's such a
poignant conversation

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:02.355 align:middle line:84%
to have 'cause now you're
talking to yourself,

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:05.958 align:middle line:84%
that yourself that's the bigger
part of you, the greater self

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.994 align:middle line:84%
of yourself that's
connected to your soul,

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:09.395 align:middle line:84%
that's connected
back to the source.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:14.867 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking to this part
of you that has a great knowing.

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:17.637 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody is
reincarnated on the other side,

00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:20.139 align:middle line:84%
that's not to say you can't
talk to the higher self

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.841 align:middle line:84%
of that soul that's
reincarnated.

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:23.543 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: OK, so there's
a possibility?

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: So it gets
a little trick--

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.379 align:middle line:90%
there's a possibility, yes.

00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:29.081 align:middle line:84%

come across negativity,

an evil entity with

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.387 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: That's-- everybody's
number one question is that.

00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:35.855 align:middle line:90%
And I really think so.

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say yes and no.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.059 align:middle line:84%
First, I want to
back up and talk

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.594 align:middle line:84%
about evil just a
moment if I may.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.929 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Do you believe in evil?

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.598 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I don't, I believe in
evil behavior and I believe

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.333 align:middle line:84%
in evil in the material,
in the man.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.235 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So you don't think
there's a demonic force?

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: No, I don't, I don't.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But yet, people can activate
the energy on themselves.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.042 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is an
absence of light

00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:58.911 align:middle line:84%
and it's not necessarily
a bad thing.

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:01.547 align:middle line:84%
What happens is people
consulate the negative energy

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:03.716 align:middle line:90%
as archetype within themselves.

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.151 align:middle line:90%
They consulate that energy

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:08.254 align:middle line:84%
where they start becoming
evil, we call that evil.

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But for an evil force to
come to the board, no,

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.225 align:middle line:84%
I know The Exorcist
talked about that.

00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:13.893 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's to say that boy--

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:15.828 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a girl on the
movie, but the boy was--

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.029 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Can you spin your head?

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:20.166 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I can't but if
other people probably can.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.334 align:middle line:90%
Alice can do that.

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:22.335 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh really?

00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:23.269 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Yeah, Alice
can spin her head.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.769 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:24.837 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: So, you know,
evil in a sense of--

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.742 align:middle line:90%
does it come to the board?

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:32.378 align:middle line:84%
I guess people are pulling
in energy of that somebody

00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:34.046 align:middle line:84%
that had died that's
feeling negative?

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:35.548 align:middle line:84%
Yes. If you want
to call that evil?

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:39.585 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And I've had some negative
spirits come through the board

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:41.821 align:middle line:84%
for not knowing better, not
knowing better how to handle

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.856 align:middle line:84%
that or how to even
set the stage,

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.424 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to
deal with that.

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I mean, you are
one of the few people

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:52.164 align:middle line:84%
who truly thinks Ouija board
is a great tool, aren't you?

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.466 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Absolutely.

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:57.169 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Now, a lot of people
are as bullish about that.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:59.038 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: That's true.

00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:02.441 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've had some really
incredible experiences with it

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's led me
on this odyssey

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
because it's always been a very
positive experience for me,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.715 align:middle line:84%
though, like I said, there's
been some negative things

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:90%
that come through.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.952 align:middle line:84%
And what I do if that happens,
I just put the board away.

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:15.021 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
talk to me that way.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.389 align:middle line:84%
You go back in the
box, bye-bye, you know?

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:17.189 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.291 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: It's as easy as that.

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:20.259 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't give
my power to the board.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:23.362 align:middle line:84%
It's-- the power that outs
here, I'm not going to allow

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:26.365 align:middle line:84%
that to interact with
me or engage with me.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.833 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Talking about
engaging, of course,

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.702 align:middle line:84%
we're interactive
here on Beyond Belief

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:33.272 align:middle line:84%
so let's take a phone
call for Karen Dahlman.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:34.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Carmen: My name is
Carmen [assumed spelling]

00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and I was wondering if there was
a way a person can manifest a

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.913 align:middle line:90%
ghost to appear?

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:43.449 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Well, not necessarily.

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:46.218 align:middle line:84%
But let me say this, working
with the board over many,

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:48.154 align:middle line:90%
many years, what you start

00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:52.058 align:middle line:84%
to get sometimes is an
energy source that comes

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.327 align:middle line:84%
through more often,
and yes, I have seen--

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:58.831 align:middle line:84%
I guess you can say
manifestations, physically

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:02.835 align:middle line:84%
and also feeling-wise
kinetically, you know,

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:04.937 align:middle line:84%
there's this clairaudience,
clairvoyance,

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:07.173 align:middle line:84%
and clairsentience, and
all those can happen.

00:15:07.173 --> 00:15:11.677 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, they can happen
from working with the board

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:14.547 align:middle line:84%
but to make them
magically appear, no.

00:15:14.547 --> 00:15:15.548 align:middle line:90%
That's saying I can do something

00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:17.917 align:middle line:84%
against somebody
else's own volition.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.553 align:middle line:84%
We definitely-- there's
a-- the karmic energy.

00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:22.922 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their own
volition, you don't cross that.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.991 align:middle line:84%
Not that I can't do
again, there's no conjuring

00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:26.392 align:middle line:90%
as we spoke about earlier.

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:29.095 align:middle line:84%
There's no magic being practiced
here, it's just I'm talking--

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.097 align:middle line:90%
I'm communicating with spirits

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.999 align:middle line:84%
that are discarnate
or have died.

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:35.134 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you ever
get disappointed Karen

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.602 align:middle line:90%
with the Ouija board?

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.971 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't give you the
information you are looking for.

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:41.907 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Absolutely, I think-- I
think when I get to this point,

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.042 align:middle line:90%
there's not so much

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:44.243 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't get the
information I wanted,

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.679 align:middle line:84%
it sometimes is a
patience process.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:49.415 align:middle line:84%
And when-- the way I use
it is it's like you start

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to learn information
and you have to work

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.518 align:middle line:90%
with that information.

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.487 align:middle line:84%
And it's really asking you
to go back within yourself

00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:56.489 align:middle line:84%
and be reflective
of this information

00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:59.358 align:middle line:84%
and see how it integrates
within your own life.

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:02.561 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a gestation
period of the information.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.597 align:middle line:84%
And there's always something
more I want to talk about

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:05.998 align:middle line:84%
and they will say,
"Well, we're done."

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:09.135 align:middle line:84%
Done for the evening because,
you know, they're tired too.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.936 align:middle line:84%
It's-- that you work
with the energy and I--

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:12.505 align:middle line:84%
my patience isn't
always the best

00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:15.107 align:middle line:84%
so I'm practicing patience
a lot with the board.

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:19.211 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What trained you to start
speaking to the spirit world?

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:22.314 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, you know, George,
I've always had encounters

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:25.985 align:middle line:84%
from a very young age of always
same things, I'll say things.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I know more what they are now.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.023 align:middle line:84%
But also, you know, my
background as a psychotherapist.

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:31.724 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:32.425 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Learning how to--

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.559 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's important.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Yeah, it's very
important, learning how

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:84%
to do a sacred space such as a
therapy space, a sacred space

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.134 align:middle line:84%
for the board, speaking
to parts, the spirits.

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:45.137 align:middle line:84%
One of my expertise was with
multiple personality disorder

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:48.174 align:middle line:84%
which is now known as the
social identity disorder.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.042 align:middle line:84%
And basically, that means
people have split off,

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:51.377 align:middle line:90%
alters within themselves.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:55.114 align:middle line:84%
If you will, parts of the
egos split, that's one theory.

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:56.916 align:middle line:90%
So I always used to talk

00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:58.784 align:middle line:84%
in all those different
parts inside of people.

00:16:58.784 --> 00:16:59.752 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:01.153 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Just like
talking to spirits.

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:02.555 align:middle line:84%
And to acknowledge them all
that they are all important.

00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:03.656 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: They are all symbols

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:04.757 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yeah, well, yeah,

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:06.592 align:middle line:84%
it's like The Three
Faces of Eve, exactly.

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:09.428 align:middle line:84%
But this is a real phenomenon
that happens in people.

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:12.297 align:middle line:84%
So dealing with each part
of that person and getting

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:13.932 align:middle line:84%
to the part that's
the evil part,

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:15.901 align:middle line:90%
they would call the evil alter,

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.836 align:middle line:84%
is really learning
understand what's it afraid of

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:19.205 align:middle line:90%
and why it became evil,

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.908 align:middle line:84%
what kind of horrific stuff
did it suffer to become that.

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.243 align:middle line:84%
Some of the spirits
on your side,

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:26.545 align:middle line:84%
if you could honor each one
that comes through and ask,

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:27.746 align:middle line:90%
"What is your message?"

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:29.048 align:middle line:84%
and if they don't-- they
like come through in more

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:30.883 align:middle line:84%
of a negative light,
they have to leave.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.519 align:middle line:84%
They come through and they want
to have a decent conversation,

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.788 align:middle line:84%
then they're welcome
to stay, the same way.

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:37.523 align:middle line:84%
I learned that from
therapy though.

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:38.991 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Have you ever
come across anybody

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:42.261 align:middle line:84%
that you believe has been
possessed by something?

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:45.231 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Working on the board or?

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.801 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Just in general, in
a psychotherapy session.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: You know, I'm
going on a limb here

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.508 align:middle line:84%
by saying this and
I would say yes.

00:17:55.508 --> 00:18:01.847 align:middle line:84%
One of the other theories with
dissociative identity disorder

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:04.917 align:middle line:84%
or I should say people with
that type of personalities,

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.453 align:middle line:90%
there's out there a theory says

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:84%
that there's also some maybe
spirit possessions within.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
My training as a hypnotherapist
and regression therapist,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.663 align:middle line:84%
what I've seen is that yes,
there's spirits that can attach

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:20.966 align:middle line:84%
to people, and I can't say in
this thing negative or evil

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.368 align:middle line:90%
but they're just lost.

00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:24.937 align:middle line:84%
They're lost from the light and
they see that person as a light

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:84%
as they see a portal or
anybody doing energetic work,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.808 align:middle line:84%
they see a light
and they go to it.

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they get
stuck and stay with it

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.778 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes they move on.

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:35.948 align:middle line:84%
And so in that case, possession,
you could call it that,

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.449 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call it
more than attachment.

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.084 align:middle line:90%
I think it-- I see it more--

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:41.487 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So we'll get people
who call the radio show coast

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:44.657 align:middle line:84%
to coast and you're an avid
listener, so you've heard some

00:18:44.657 --> 00:18:50.896 align:middle line:84%
of these people where they
truly are either very mixed up

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:56.035 align:middle line:84%
and confused or something
is taking them over.

00:18:56.035 --> 00:18:57.436 align:middle line:90%
It's one or the other.

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:59.705 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, and there could be
a psychological disorders, too.

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:01.841 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there can be really a
chemical imbalance in which--

00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:02.908 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah, absolutely, sure.

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:03.909 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: -- which cause
the brain problem,

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:04.977 align:middle line:84%
they're on medication
or, you know,

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.378 align:middle line:84%
schizophrenia is a
good thing that shows--

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:08.814 align:middle line:90%
illness that shows that as well.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:11.851 align:middle line:84%
And so you can lose your
variance of reality.

00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:13.786 align:middle line:90%
And that's a real thing as well.

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.621 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look at way
to allow it and it's hard

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:17.923 align:middle line:84%
to make a comment on that
unless you actually have worked

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.792 align:middle line:84%
with a person in a, you
know, a therapy session

00:19:19.792 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:90%
and really know what's going on.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I say if you
do any kind of energy work,

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.799 align:middle line:84%
any kind of divination
work, any kind of work

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:28.767 align:middle line:84%
like with the Ouija board
or you're opening yourself

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.769 align:middle line:90%
up to spirits, you really--

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:33.005 align:middle line:84%
again, I don't believe
in the evil forces

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:36.008 align:middle line:84%
but I do believe there's
negativity and you have

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.611 align:middle line:84%
to really work with the
good energies in yourself.

00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:40.579 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying things
are black and white and bad

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:42.581 align:middle line:84%
and good, I'm just
saying know how to balance

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:44.883 align:middle line:84%
that within yourself, know
how to know the difference.

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:46.885 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
something that's not right,

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:48.621 align:middle line:90%
do not engage with it.

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:51.657 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, as you know, I
don't use the Ouija board.

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:52.992 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Right.

00:19:52.992 --> 00:19:55.327 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I was going to do an
experiment on coast to coast

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:58.731 align:middle line:84%
and decided to cancel
it and about 75 percent

00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:02.334 align:middle line:84%
of the people were very
happy I didn't do it.

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.638 align:middle line:84%
There was a 25 percent group
that they were holding pi

00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> GN:a parties and they
wanted this to happen.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.011 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend
everybody use Ouija board

00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:13.445 align:middle line:84%
or are there some
people that should not?

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:17.449 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I don't recommend this
as everybody's path or tool

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:19.084 align:middle line:90%
to use, absolutely not.

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:21.153 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to
feel a calling to it,

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:23.555 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be a
dowser or a pendulum or--

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.758 align:middle line:90%
use a pendulum or tarot card.

00:20:25.758 --> 00:20:27.226 align:middle line:84%
There's a calling
to it and then you--

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.762 align:middle line:84%
that becomes your item
that you might use.

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:32.498 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I use other tools too
to speak to the other side.

00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:34.266 align:middle line:84%
But this is one tool that
I can share with others

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:36.468 align:middle line:84%
and it's been really
powerful for me.

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:39.038 align:middle line:84%
But no, I don't recommend
everybody to use it.

00:20:39.038 --> 00:20:40.139 align:middle line:84%
I think people that
are interested

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:42.808 align:middle line:84%
in using it definitely
can learn to use it,

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:46.078 align:middle line:84%
and use it in a really,
in lightening manner,

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.547 align:middle line:84%
and my new book talks
about how to do just that,

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:50.849 align:middle line:84%
to do it in that lightening
manner so it's really

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:54.286 align:middle line:84%
about spirit development and
an evolution of yourself.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:56.088 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Why are some
people afraid of it then?

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.223 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, I think, you know,
it had us fall from grace.

00:20:58.223 --> 00:21:01.427 align:middle line:84%
Here, you know, [inaudible]
of the day, heyday,

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:03.796 align:middle line:84%
and almost every household
and then it [inaudible] grace

00:21:03.796 --> 00:21:06.198 align:middle line:90%
in 1973 with The Exorcist.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So the movie comes
out in '73, right?

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.269 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, we
hear that here is Regan,

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.037 align:middle line:84%
the girl which is really
the boy in real life--

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:12.971 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: -- talking
to Captain Howdy

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.476 align:middle line:84%
and it's scared the bejesus
out of people, right?

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:18.777 align:middle line:90%
It scared them.

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:20.579 align:middle line:84%
And so people-- and that was
just a less than a minute,

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.414 align:middle line:84%
I think, scene, about
a minute, I guess.

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:24.016 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I bet sales
for the thing went

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.217 align:middle line:84%
through the roof
after that movie.

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:26.618 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: It did because now
here's children going,

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:28.053 align:middle line:90%
it scared for eight years

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:30.522 align:middle line:84%
and older thinking,
"Wow, mysterious.

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:33.225 align:middle line:84%
Scary, I could do them
both at slumber parties.

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:84%
This will be fun, we can
entertain ourselves."

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.697 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I engaged in that
myself too 'cause that was back

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:41.133 align:middle line:84%
in the-- I got my board
around that same--

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.534 align:middle line:90%
actually the same time.

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:45.371 align:middle line:84%
It was December '73 when that
movie came out in December '73,

00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:46.905 align:middle line:84%
I got it right before
it came out.

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:48.207 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I had a board.

00:21:48.207 --> 00:21:49.575 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Did you?

00:21:49.575 --> 00:21:52.444 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I had a board once and
I brought it into my studio

00:21:52.444 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:90%
and everything went wrong.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.949 align:middle line:90%
Everything went wrong.

00:21:56.949 --> 00:22:00.753 align:middle line:84%
The audio board was screwed up,
the computers were screwed up.

00:22:00.753 --> 00:22:03.655 align:middle line:84%
I had my producer take the
board out of the studio

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:06.859 align:middle line:84%
and everything went back
on, everything was fine.

00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:11.296 align:middle line:84%
He gave the board to a
newsman at a radio station.

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:13.031 align:middle line:90%
Poor Daryl [assumed spelling].

00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:15.601 align:middle line:90%
Daryl took the board home.

00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:19.138 align:middle line:84%
He got fired two days
later, didn't know why.

00:22:19.138 --> 00:22:21.273 align:middle line:90%
His relationship ended abruptly

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:24.209 align:middle line:84%
about a week later,
didn't know why.

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:26.979 align:middle line:84%
I ran to him about
year and a half later.

00:22:26.979 --> 00:22:29.581 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Daryl, you
know, I'm sorry.

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:31.984 align:middle line:84%
You know, took off and I
didn't have a chance to say bye

00:22:31.984 --> 00:22:34.386 align:middle line:90%
to you and how are you."

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:40.192 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I'm fine now since
I got rid of the Ouija board."

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:44.563 align:middle line:84%
He was convinced that
this board that I gave him

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:48.834 align:middle line:84%
that gave us problems
destroyed his life.

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:51.437 align:middle line:84%
And until he got rid
of it, he wasn't able

00:22:51.437 --> 00:22:53.172 align:middle line:90%
to patch his life back up again.

00:22:53.172 --> 00:22:54.573 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:56.975 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, you know, again,
I'm not there to judge him but--

00:22:56.975 --> 00:22:58.177 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: This Ouija board-ologist.

00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:00.145 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, OK, from a
Ouijalogist's perspective,

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:01.914 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you how
to explain that.

00:23:01.914 --> 00:23:04.416 align:middle line:84%
How to explain it is is that,
first of all, number one,

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:07.186 align:middle line:84%
don't give your power away to
something outside yourself.

00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:08.387 align:middle line:90%
And I think sometimes you--

00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:10.622 align:middle line:84%
people can have a string
of interesting luck,

00:23:10.622 --> 00:23:12.124 align:middle line:84%
I'll call it that,
because everything happens

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:12.858 align:middle line:90%
for a reason, everything--

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:13.659 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:23:13.659 --> 00:23:14.793 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: -- is synchronistic.

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:16.028 align:middle line:84%
I know you have talked
about that before too.

00:23:16.028 --> 00:23:17.996 align:middle line:84%
So he probably landed
in a much better job,

00:23:17.996 --> 00:23:19.832 align:middle line:84%
much better position
on the long run.

00:23:19.832 --> 00:23:22.034 align:middle line:84%
I bet you he did it, you
checked in on him, right?

00:23:22.034 --> 00:23:22.935 align:middle line:90%
So I--

00:23:22.935 --> 00:23:23.569 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Took a while.

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:24.636 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: That's OK.

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:25.571 align:middle line:90%
Life takes a while.

00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:26.839 align:middle line:90%
It's about patience again.

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:27.606 align:middle line:90%
It is a process.

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:28.474 align:middle line:90%
Life is a process.

00:23:28.474 --> 00:23:30.676 align:middle line:90%
So, you know, I would say--

00:23:30.676 --> 00:23:33.645 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say it
didn't cause it or caused it,

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.814 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to say let's don't
get power outside of ourselves,

00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:37.916 align:middle line:84%
let's keep the power
to our self.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:42.254 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just laminated
crest wood and there's a veneer

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.389 align:middle line:84%
on top, bottom, or
something, it has a new--

00:23:44.389 --> 00:23:45.591 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How many of
these did you bring?

00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:47.493 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: I brought six.

00:23:47.493 --> 00:23:50.729 align:middle line:84%
This is the one I've
had for 40 years.

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:52.798 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That's the
game one, isn't it?

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Well, this the original
and I received from Santa Claus.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.767 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:56.468 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Right.

00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:57.469 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: From bad Santa.

00:23:57.469 --> 00:23:58.136 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Good Santa.

00:23:58.136 --> 00:23:59.838 align:middle line:90%
So, you know what?

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:02.341 align:middle line:84%
I am going to say don't
attribute the Ouija board.

00:24:02.341 --> 00:24:04.343 align:middle line:84%
You can if you like,
but I say I wouldn't

00:24:04.343 --> 00:24:05.878 align:middle line:84%
because that's putting
power outside yourself.

00:24:05.878 --> 00:24:07.446 align:middle line:84%
Things change for
him for a reason.

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:09.948 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you have
to ask it questions?

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:10.749 align:middle line:90%
Or does it just--

00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:11.717 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: No.

00:24:11.717 --> 00:24:13.085 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- start working
on its own?

00:24:13.085 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Because of where I am
with working events for so long,

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.388 align:middle line:84%
I get on to my friends
and I [inaudible] come on

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:17.656 align:middle line:90%
and they just start talking.

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:19.291 align:middle line:84%
I would have said
I'm open up to--

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.893 align:middle line:84%
I open message for
whoever is here tonight.

00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:22.361 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Does that
ever never work?

00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:23.762 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yes, in fact, it doesn't.

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:26.632 align:middle line:84%
That's a great question because
I have learned over the years,

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:29.568 align:middle line:84%
there's planetary
atmospheric effects,

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:33.038 align:middle line:90%
and I liken it to a telephone.

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:36.241 align:middle line:84%
My joke is call 1800-Ouija-for
you.

00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:39.077 align:middle line:84%
Right. But it does work
like a wireless phone

00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:41.513 align:middle line:84%
and it has a frequency
and a vibration.

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:44.049 align:middle line:84%
And what happens if that
frequency somehow interfered

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:46.018 align:middle line:84%
with the electromagnetic
frequency

00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:48.253 align:middle line:84%
of using this communication
to the other side?

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:50.923 align:middle line:84%
And that could be
atmospheric, could be planetary,

00:24:50.923 --> 00:24:52.724 align:middle line:84%
that could be wind,
storms, and sometimes,

00:24:52.724 --> 00:24:53.592 align:middle line:90%
I want to say atmospheric.

00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:54.426 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:56.094 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: It doesn't always work.

00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:59.331 align:middle line:84%
Huge dust storms, lightning
storms, they come through

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and they tell me, "It's
not going to work."

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.302 align:middle line:84%
We can-- they try to talk
and they might say two

00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:06.171 align:middle line:84%
or three words, "Can't do
it tonight" and that's it.

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And I find out later why.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.043 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Have you ever
had the Ouija board

00:25:11.043 --> 00:25:13.478 align:middle line:90%
like start running on its own?

00:25:13.478 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: I've heard
people do that before.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.215 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Or like you had the
planchette on it and all

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:19.084 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden it's
just moving around?

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:19.918 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Not for me.

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:90%
I have heard those stories.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.023 align:middle line:84%
I will say, I've had with it
me [inaudible] board before.

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:27.192 align:middle line:84%
It has gotten really
excited for something to say.

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:29.428 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a negative thing
for me, but I've heard

00:25:29.428 --> 00:25:31.496 align:middle line:84%
where people seen
it move on its own,

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.332 align:middle line:90%
but I haven't witnessed that.

00:25:33.332 --> 00:25:34.766 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That would
be kind of spooky.

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:37.002 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: It's a little
freakish, yeah.

00:25:37.002 --> 00:25:40.405 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: What has been the most
enlightening Ouija board story

00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:41.573 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever had?

00:25:41.573 --> 00:25:43.542 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Oh well, the
most enlightening--

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
there's been quite
a few I must say.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.513 align:middle line:84%
But the one that really touches
me still to this day is the one

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:52.517 align:middle line:84%
with my turning point on how I
was going to use Ouija board.

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:55.187 align:middle line:84%
And it happened when
I was in college.

00:25:55.187 --> 00:25:58.724 align:middle line:84%
I was in a sorority back then
and I had a bunch of girls

00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:01.493 align:middle line:84%
that were very curious about the
board but yet very scared of it.

00:26:01.493 --> 00:26:02.794 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:26:02.794 --> 00:26:03.862 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: And they wanted to
know does thing really work.

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:05.897 align:middle line:84%
And I was having great
success with it--

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.299 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And you knew it worked.

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:90%
You knew.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.067 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: I knew it worked.

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:10.936 align:middle line:84%
So I said, "Let's
blindfold ourselves,"

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:12.337 align:middle line:84%
which is something
I don't do now.

00:26:12.337 --> 00:26:14.139 align:middle line:90%
It was more of a novelty thing.

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.475 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: So the two of
us operating the board,

00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:18.777 align:middle line:84%
blindfolded ourselves,
somebody else wrote,

00:26:18.777 --> 00:26:22.014 align:middle line:84%
we couldn't see a thing in the
board and the planchette flew

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:25.517 align:middle line:90%
around this board and most fast,

00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:26.685 align:middle line:84%
quickest way I've
ever seen it do.

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:30.155 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea what
it was spelling out.

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:33.458 align:middle line:84%
But when it was done, it had
a message to one of the gals

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:35.794 align:middle line:84%
that was sitting there
and she was in tears.

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:38.563 align:middle line:90%
And it said basically so and so,

00:26:38.563 --> 00:26:39.865 align:middle line:84%
I always protect
people's privacy--

00:26:39.865 --> 00:26:40.699 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes, I understand.

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:41.767 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: -- so with their names.

00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So and so, this is
your sister, tell dad

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.239 align:middle line:90%
and my other sister that I'm OK.

00:26:47.239 --> 00:26:50.575 align:middle line:84%
When that horrific car wreck
happened, I immediately left,

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:51.977 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel any pain,

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:53.412 align:middle line:84%
my boyfriend's fine
too, he's here as well.

00:26:53.412 --> 00:26:54.613 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And it was
spelling all that up?

00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:56.948 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: It spelled it
out to point blank.

00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:59.384 align:middle line:84%
The story is in my by
the way and everything,

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:02.187 align:middle line:84%
it spelled out so
perfectly, no misspellings,

00:27:02.187 --> 00:27:04.723 align:middle line:90%
it was just beautiful.

00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:08.093 align:middle line:84%
And then basically it said, the
only pain we felt was the pain

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:09.394 align:middle line:90%
that the family experienced--

00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:10.362 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:27:10.362 --> 00:27:11.463 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: -- you know,
from the loss.

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:13.098 align:middle line:84%
And that you still,
up to this day, hold.

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:14.566 align:middle line:84%
And so we're here to tell
you that we love you.

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:16.668 align:middle line:84%
We never feel any
pain, we're with you,

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
we'll be with you again, and
know that we're always here,

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.439 align:middle line:84%
and just tell mom
and dad, I love them.

00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:22.774 align:middle line:84%
And there was not a
dry eye in that room.

00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:23.475 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: She was in shock.

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.343 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: She was in shock.

00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:25.410 align:middle line:90%
She was crying.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.112 align:middle line:84%
I think I broke the
silence and thought,

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:28.647 align:middle line:84%
"Let's just all be
quiet for a moment."

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:29.815 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:31.483 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Take this in
because to me, that was--

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:34.152 align:middle line:84%
the first use of the board,
I met a dead sister as well.

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:37.222 align:middle line:84%
And here was a poignant moment
where I said, "This board,

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:39.691 align:middle line:84%
there is a responsibility
I have, there's no more fun

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.259 align:middle line:84%
and games, no more
blind folding."

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:42.027 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:42.861 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Now, it's really--

00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:43.695 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: This is serious stuff.

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:44.463 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: This is serious stuff.

00:27:44.463 --> 00:27:45.864 align:middle line:90%
This is very therapeutic.

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:50.135 align:middle line:84%
If somebody can have that kind
of release that she had carried

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:52.704 align:middle line:84%
for years of the pain
of her sister dying

00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:54.172 align:middle line:84%
and how horrific
that must have felt.

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:56.575 align:middle line:90%
When she was-- she believed it.

00:27:56.575 --> 00:28:00.178 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And the girl who was
writing down the letters,

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:01.146 align:middle line:90%
she did not know about this?

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:01.947 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: She did not know.

00:28:01.947 --> 00:28:03.548 align:middle line:90%
One person in the room knew.

00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:06.118 align:middle line:84%
But I do not know and the other
gal did not know who's writing

00:28:06.118 --> 00:28:06.785 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:07.786 align:middle line:90%
And we were shocked.

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:09.721 align:middle line:84%
Nobody in the room
knew the one gal.

00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:11.223 align:middle line:90%
And-- oh, excuse me.

00:28:11.223 --> 00:28:13.492 align:middle line:84%
And the girl who's sister it
was, there's two in the room.

00:28:13.492 --> 00:28:14.860 align:middle line:84%
There's probably eight
of us there, I believe.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.828 align:middle line:90%
I think it was eight.

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:19.731 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in my book, one
of these people that was

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:21.133 align:middle line:90%
in that room is in my book too.

00:28:21.133 --> 00:28:23.535 align:middle line:84%
And, right, so they can
account of that story

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.103 align:middle line:90%
from their experience of Ouija.

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:27.038 align:middle line:90%
It changed her life too.

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
That was a big changing
point for all of us.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.575 align:middle line:84%
Some people didn't
want to talk about it.

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: No.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.645 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Because it was really
kind of scary in a way.

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:36.081 align:middle line:90%
And then very heart warming too.

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:37.916 align:middle line:90%
It was bittersweet.

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:39.918 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it was
very important

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:41.753 align:middle line:90%
to know this surreal tool.

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:43.188 align:middle line:90%
It's not a game anymore.

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:44.389 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going
to use it that way.

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.323 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Serious stuff.

00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:46.725 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Oh, it's serious stuff.

00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:49.661 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take another phone
call for you, Karen, here we go.

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:52.297 align:middle line:84%
>> Mary: Hi Karen, my name
is Mary [assumed spelling].

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:56.768 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know your
best positive story involving

00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Ouija board.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, the one you just
mentioned is kind of positive.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.077 align:middle line:84%
Is there something that might be
humorous or funny that happened?

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:09.181 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: Yeah, you know
what-- OK, that's good.

00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:10.682 align:middle line:84%
We just talked about
the positive,

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.684 align:middle line:84%
the one most turning
point story.

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:16.488 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, sometimes if I'm
too serious, they'll say,

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:18.323 align:middle line:84%
"Would you lighten
up and joke more."

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:20.091 align:middle line:84%
OK. And then if I joke
too much, they tell me,

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.293 align:middle line:84%
"Please be a little
more serious."

00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:23.061 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you can't
win for losing, you know?

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:24.696 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well how
are you supposed to be.

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:27.966 align:middle line:84%
They have, on the other side,
there's such a sense of humor,

00:29:27.966 --> 00:29:29.434 align:middle line:84%
and they do bring that
through in their messages.

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:32.838 align:middle line:84%
And they do bring it through in
the way they will talk to us.

00:29:32.838 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
They have different names
for me at times depending

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.908 align:middle line:90%
on what's going on in my life.

00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:40.345 align:middle line:84%
And there-- it's almost like
an older brother or something,

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:42.881 align:middle line:84%
being very affectionate
and just friendly

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:44.115 align:middle line:90%
and treating me that way.

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:90%
So they bring a sense of humor.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:50.589 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you another
real brief story if I may.

00:29:50.589 --> 00:29:51.957 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> KD: That's really funny,
and also heartwarming as well.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.597 align:middle line:84%
You can use the Ouija board to
talk to living consciousness,

00:29:58.597 --> 00:30:00.198 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned before
like higher selves.

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:01.499 align:middle line:90%
You could talk to animals.

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:05.203 align:middle line:84%
Animals who have passed on
and animals that are alive.

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So I like talking to
my cats that are alive.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.776 align:middle line:84%
And they say the
funniest things.

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:14.279 align:middle line:84%
And I did put a whole section
in the new book about that.

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to give it away.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.349 align:middle line:84%
But some of the things
they come up with,

00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:20.719 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I can even be
that funny and say these things.

00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:22.354 align:middle line:84%
But the animals have
a sense of humor.

00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:24.556 align:middle line:84%
And they live in the now
and so do the spirits.

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:26.591 align:middle line:84%
They live in the now and
have a sense of humor.

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.827 align:middle line:84%
They don't take things
too seriously but

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:31.730 align:middle line:84%
yet they do take it sacred
when they communicate.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.865 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Did they ever
spell out M-E-O-W?

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:35.634 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yes, they have.

00:30:35.634 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:90%
And the Ouija boards also spell

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.939 align:middle line:84%
out R-O-L-A-I-D-S
before, Rolaids.

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:42.474 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I just love it.

00:30:42.474 --> 00:30:43.842 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting tool.

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:90%
You enjoy it.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.278 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: I do.

00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:48.346 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You're enlightened by it.

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:51.917 align:middle line:84%
But you don't hold
anything against those of us

00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:52.784 align:middle line:90%
who don't want to use it.

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:54.185 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Absolutely not.

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:57.822 align:middle line:84%
And I welcome people to stand
on their own position with this.

00:30:57.822 --> 00:31:00.792 align:middle line:84%
And I welcome people to
stay with their own faith.

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:01.893 align:middle line:90%
If that's what that is.

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:03.061 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing to
do with my faith.

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:06.698 align:middle line:84%
This just has to do with
something, a tool I use

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:09.834 align:middle line:84%
to develop, to develop
myself in different ways.

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:13.672 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's a message that
the Ouija board has, and that--

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:15.307 align:middle line:90%
well, the way I use Ouija board.

00:31:15.307 --> 00:31:18.543 align:middle line:84%
And the message is this,
that our worlds are larger

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.211 align:middle line:84%
when we go further
within ourselves.

00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:21.713 align:middle line:84%
As we go deeper within
ourselves,

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.615 align:middle line:90%
our worlds become larger.

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:84%
The way I use Ouija,
it teaches us to go

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.219 align:middle line:90%
within to find the answers.

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:30.989 align:middle line:84%
They'll give insight
and ideas and concepts.

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:32.424 align:middle line:84%
And then say, "Please,
now take that

00:31:32.424 --> 00:31:33.525 align:middle line:90%
and let us know what you think."

00:31:33.525 --> 00:31:35.493 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole idea
that you're supposed

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:37.696 align:middle line:90%
to process this yourself.

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:40.031 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Have you ever had
someone come through the Ouija

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:43.668 align:middle line:84%
and you have no idea
who it is or what it is?

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:45.003 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Yes that's happened.

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:47.639 align:middle line:84%
It's happened more in the
beginning when I first started

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't quite clear on
how you keep the balance running

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.713 align:middle line:84%
or the [inaudible], if
you will, the gatekeeper.

00:31:54.713 --> 00:31:58.116 align:middle line:84%
And I've had-- I've been in
houses that have been haunted

00:31:58.116 --> 00:32:00.585 align:middle line:84%
where they'll come through
and I wasn't prepared.

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.988 align:middle line:84%
I'm prepared now, but
yes, there's spirits

00:32:02.988 --> 00:32:04.255 align:middle line:90%
that can come through.

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:07.092 align:middle line:84%
And I will always ask them
to identify themselves.

00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:10.161 align:middle line:84%
And I always immediately
call upon my other guides

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:12.097 align:middle line:84%
and guardians on the
other side to come

00:32:12.097 --> 00:32:13.598 align:middle line:90%
through and help as well.

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:17.268 align:middle line:84%
That's a powerful lesson I
learned many, many years ago.

00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:20.305 align:middle line:84%
Probably 25 years ago, I
think I learned that lesson

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:23.208 align:middle line:84%
that it's important to have
your helpers on the other side.

00:32:23.208 --> 00:32:25.677 align:middle line:84%
You can't do this alone and
you need to pull in those

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:30.515 align:middle line:84%
that you can help you do it in a
proactive way, in a healthy way.

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:32.083 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Remember Karen's
first book, of course,

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:34.753 align:middle line:84%
is called "The Spirit
of Creativity."

00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:38.089 align:middle line:84%
Her second book is
"The Spirits of Ouija."

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:39.691 align:middle line:84%
Karen, good luck with
everything you do.

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:41.092 align:middle line:90%
>> KD: Thank you very much.

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:44.662 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you've been watching,
of course, Beyond Belief.

00:32:44.662 --> 00:33:02.313 align:middle line:90%
