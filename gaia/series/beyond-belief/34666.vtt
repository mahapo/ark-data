fascinates so many people,

How did you get into it?

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:17.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: I was, it was
1975, that almost dates me,

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:18.812 align:middle line:90%
and I was in New York.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.081 align:middle line:84%
And I'll admit, because
I'm not ashamed

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.116 align:middle line:90%
of it, I was a folk singer.

do it now if you want

as long as I don't cough.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:36.029 align:middle line:84%
I'd gone to New York from
New Hampshire in 1970

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.366 align:middle line:84%
to earn my fame and
fortune and I had a goal

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:90%
of having a record album.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.636 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted to
have a record album.

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:47.807 align:middle line:84%
In 1973, I'm not
sure if you remember

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:50.976 align:middle line:84%
or if the audience remembers,
but there was a whole wave

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
of UFO sightings all
around the country.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.282 align:middle line:90%
It made big headlines.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.783 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Mainly in Michigan.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes,
that's right, that's right.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:03.557 align:middle line:84%
And probably the most amazing
story, the most prolific story

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that came out of it was the
story of an Army helicopter

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.864 align:middle line:84%
that was under the control
of Captain Larry Coyne,

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
a four man crew, they
were flying over Ohio

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.403 align:middle line:84%
and this thing was
approaching them very rapidly

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:17.637 align:middle line:90%
from the horizon.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.207 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was a radio
tower beacon at first.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:21.641 align:middle line:90%
And they braced for impact.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.876 align:middle line:84%
They thought they were
going to collide with it.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.578 align:middle line:90%
And instead of the collision,

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:28.181 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden the thing
stopped above their helicopter.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.749 align:middle line:90%
It was a cigar shaped vehicle.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.153 align:middle line:84%
It had no wings, no
horizontal, vertical stabilizers

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:37.257 align:middle line:84%
and it was just parked
in the sky above them.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:39.559 align:middle line:84%
And a beam of light
came out of it

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:43.897 align:middle line:84%
and their entire cockpit was a
green light, everything inside.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:46.299 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
totally scared.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.602 align:middle line:84%
They'd never encountered
anything like this.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:52.873 align:middle line:84%
And within a few seconds their
helicopter was lifted straight

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.408 align:middle line:90%
up into the air by this object.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:90%
In a matter of seconds they went

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.677 align:middle line:84%
for like another three
or four thousand feet

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.046 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Wow.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:01.414 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Straight up
and then there was a bump

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:04.818 align:middle line:84%
and the object released the
helicopter and they were able

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:08.588 align:middle line:90%
to fly back to the Army base.

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:11.024 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as soon as they
got there they radioed ahead

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.392 align:middle line:90%
and said get the press there.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.327 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
what just happened to us.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:17.731 align:middle line:84%
There were witnesses also on
the ground who saw this and so

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:19.032 align:middle line:90%
that added to the credibility.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.033 align:middle line:90%
And the Army

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.368 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
That's an amazing story.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And the Army
didn't mind letting Coyne go

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.273 align:middle line:84%
on TV, and I first
became aware of it,

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:27.974 align:middle line:84%
he was on the old
Dick Cavett show.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.109 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And I
thought, what is this?

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.778 align:middle line:84%
Why are they telling
us about this story?

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:34.047 align:middle line:90%
Shouldn't this be secret?

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.682 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Echoing
exactly what you've just said.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:38.818 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Yeah and
because I think it came

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:40.954 align:middle line:84%
under the category of
well they can't prove it.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Even with eye witnesses they
may have mistaken the craft

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.693 align:middle line:90%
for the planet Venus, you know.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:47.761 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Yeah it just happened

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:48.927 align:middle line:90%
to pull a helicopter up.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:50.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Of course.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.732 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.401 align:middle line:90%
And what got me really curious.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.903 align:middle line:84%
It was also the year
of two fisherman

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.905 align:middle line:90%
down in Pascagoula, Mississippi.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Great story.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Who claimed that
they were fishing on the end

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:05.345 align:middle line:84%
of a dock and they saw this
ship and they saw a creature.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.882 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up being on board
whatever this thing was before

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:10.083 align:middle line:90%
they were let loose.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.985 align:middle line:90%
And that made headlines.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:16.855 align:middle line:84%
And it was just an
amazing year in 1973

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:90%
and I started reading books.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.526 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well I remember
the J. Alan Hynek story too

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.329 align:middle line:90%
where during that period,

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:26.066 align:middle line:84%
he called it swamp gas
and it haunted him.

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:27.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: It did.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:32.872 align:middle line:84%
It was in Michigan in the home
of then Congressman Gerald Ford.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:36.676 align:middle line:84%
And there were sightings of
weird things in rural Michigan

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:41.214 align:middle line:84%
and the Air Force sent Hynek
there to debunk it because Hynek

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:46.119 align:middle line:84%
at the time, in 1967, 68, was
still part of Project Blue Book.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.456 align:middle line:84%
That was the Air Force's
UFO investigating project.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: That's right.

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:54.427 align:middle line:84%
It was a 20 year project that
actually finally ended in 1969.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.496 align:middle line:90%
But they sent Hynek to Michigan.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It was on all the news.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.366 align:middle line:84%
And he basically
said was well I think

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:02.635 align:middle line:84%
that what people are seeing
here is a form of swamp gas.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Well he never lived that down.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.171 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
No he never did.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Until
the day he died.

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:10.009 align:middle line:84%
Because the swamp gas has
always become affiliated

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:10.777 align:middle line:90%
with any kind of

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:11.845 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: With him.

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:13.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: With
him and with UFO's.

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:21.121 align:middle line:84%
And he and I finally met in
1975 when I was so interested

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:24.991 align:middle line:84%
in this whole UFO thing and
this light bulb appeared

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:29.562 align:middle line:84%
over my head one day and said
click on, you're not going

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.198 align:middle line:84%
to pursue your folk
singing career anymore.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:36.069 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
chasing flying saucers now.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.438 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of went with that.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:39.873 align:middle line:90%
And I was reading books.

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:42.675 align:middle line:84%
And there was one book in
particular written by Ralph

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:47.113 align:middle line:84%
and Judy Blum called Beyond
Earth, Man's Contact with UFO's.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:48.448 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And you were hooked.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And I was
really hooked and it was cool

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:53.686 align:middle line:84%
because he at the time
was working with NBC,

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:59.325 align:middle line:84%
doing a special NBC report
about UFO's based on his book.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:04.497 align:middle line:84%
And I used to, where I
worked as a guitar salesman,

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:09.669 align:middle line:84%
was a block away from 30
Rock at NBC so one day I went

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.238 align:middle line:90%
over to NBC because I wanted

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.908 align:middle line:84%
to find this guy and
introduce myself.

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:19.579 align:middle line:84%
And I got to NBC and discovered
very quickly that you can't get

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.248 align:middle line:84%
through security because you
can't get through security.

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.216 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
can't just show up.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.384 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: You can't do it.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.853 align:middle line:84%
And so I got there
coincidentally

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:29.856 align:middle line:84%
at the same time a big group
of people were waiting to go

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:31.925 align:middle line:90%
through security to go upstairs

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:34.093 align:middle line:84%
to watch a taping of
the show Jeopardy.

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:37.697 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Okay and you
kind of pushed your way through.

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:41.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: I got in line
and decided well while I'm here,

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:42.602 align:middle line:90%
I went to see Jeopardy.

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:46.139 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm never going
to get this chance again.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.507 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Yeah, might as well.

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And saw the
show and when the show was over,

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.679 align:middle line:84%
the audience had to leave
and instead of going back

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.348 align:middle line:84%
to the elevators, I
went the other direction

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:90%
and I started asking around.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.351 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
You've been going

00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.953 align:middle line:84%
in that other direction
ever since, you know that.

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:01.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: You and I both.

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.656 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up finding
the office

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:07.393 align:middle line:84%
where Ralph Blum had a desk
where he'd been helping NBC

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
with this TV special and
I told the people there

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.167 align:middle line:84%
that I was there to
pick up Mr. Blum's mail.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:16.202 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Wow,
you were enterprising.

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:20.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And they gave it
to me and I had his address all

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.609 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden, in New York City.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:25.178 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Devious person you are.

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: My father
would have called me a Gunnulf

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:28.481 align:middle line:90%
or a Mitch.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:29.582 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And
I thought alright,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.019 align:middle line:84%
I can get to this address
up on Madison Avenue.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.688 align:middle line:84%
I put all of his mail into
a bag and I wrote a note.

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:37.056 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
you did deliver it?

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:37.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Oh I did.

00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:39.726 align:middle line:90%
Dear Mr. Blum, I'm Lee Speigal.

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:40.727 align:middle line:90%
I love your book.

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:42.495 align:middle line:90%
I've got a couple of ideas.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:43.796 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to meet you.

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.932 align:middle line:84%
And I brought it
up to the building

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:90%
and I gave it to his super.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.069 align:middle line:84%
Because the stuff I
had was too bulky.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.171 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And of course
you were the NBC delivery boy.

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:53.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Oh
yeah, I've just come

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:56.476 align:middle line:90%
from NBC with Mr. Blum's mail.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.979 align:middle line:84%
Left it, went away and a
couple days later my phone rang

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.282 align:middle line:84%
and this voice says
is this Lee Speigal?

00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:04.217 align:middle line:90%
Yes. This is Ralph Blum.

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:06.452 align:middle line:84%
Who the hell are you and
how did you get my mail?

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I love that.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And
I told him the story

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.523 align:middle line:90%
and he said yeah, that's me.

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:14.694 align:middle line:84%
And we became friends and with
his contacts we ended up going

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
to CBS and pitching them on
an idea to give me front money

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.936 align:middle line:84%
and to let me go
around the country

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.637 align:middle line:90%
with a portable tape recorder.

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.739 align:middle line:90%
And at the time, in 1975,

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:29.008 align:middle line:84%
the smallest portable tape
recorder you could get was

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.109 align:middle line:90%
like this big.

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:31.844 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Was
that big, a Sony, right?

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:34.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: It was a Sony.

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:37.016 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly found
myself going

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.385 align:middle line:84%
around the country
interviewing people

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:43.523 align:middle line:84%
like Astronaut Gordon Cooper,
J. Alan Hynek and I should say,

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:44.757 align:middle line:90%
because you'll love this,

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:48.161 align:middle line:84%
the first person we ever
interviewed, Stan Friedman.

00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:51.464 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Yes, four
guys who is still going.

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And I
interviewed Captain Coyne

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.335 align:middle line:90%
about the helicopter incident.

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:59.272 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself amazed at
the people who I was meeting

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:04.544 align:middle line:84%
and talking to and what
it eventually turned

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.846 align:middle line:90%
into was a record album.

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.348 align:middle line:84%
I had always wanted
a record album.

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:09.182 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Yeah, there it is.

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:10.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: There it was.

00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:11.618 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: See perfect.

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:84%
You're writing now for
the Huffington Post.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes I am.

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.089 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I am so happy

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:20.093 align:middle line:84%
that they are giving
you the space to write

00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:22.195 align:middle line:90%
and cover these kinds of stories

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
because as you know there aren't
a lot of major media that gives

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.436 align:middle line:90%
that kind of attention.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: It's great
working for Huffington Post

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:36.976 align:middle line:84%
and I get sometimes a lot
of criticism from readers,

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:38.811 align:middle line:84%
and I think sometimes
justifiably

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:43.383 align:middle line:84%
so because there is no UFO
section or paranormal section.

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Yet
in Huffington Post.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And they want that?

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: A lot of
people would like that, yeah.

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:53.626 align:middle line:84%
But now the most logical
place to put my stuff is

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:55.928 align:middle line:90%
in the weird news section.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:58.264 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll sometimes
find my stories sandwiched

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:03.136 align:middle line:84%
in you know UFO this next to the
man with the largest scrotum.

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.437 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah exactly.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Five headed
turtle born in Indonesia.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.741 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The
world's ugliest fish

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:11.444 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Yeah and I knock
on wood that I'm doing this

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.717 align:middle line:84%
at all and that I'm doing it
for a mainstream publication

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.018 align:middle line:90%
and they're letting me do

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.319 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You get a
lot of pick up on that too.

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:21.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes.

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:24.791 align:middle line:84%
You're very helpful
on Coast to Coast AM.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.527 align:middle line:84%
You reprint and link
to a lot of my stories.

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:30.229 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great synergy.

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:31.497 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Absolutely.

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.766 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: But the
audience doesn't always get it.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.269 align:middle line:84%
They say why are
you on weird news?

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:38.404 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't you on
the UFO section?

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:39.872 align:middle line:90%
Sorry we don't have one yet.

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:41.074 align:middle line:90%
But please keep reading.

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.241 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Exactly.

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.776 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
more about Gordon Cooper.

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Okay.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.878 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I have seen now

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:48.281 align:middle line:84%
for the seventh time the
great movie, The Right Stuff.

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:49.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yeah.

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:51.951 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And you know
Gordon Cooper was highlighted

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:90%
in that movie.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:59.025 align:middle line:84%
And he was a cocky
astronaut and a darn good one.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes he was.

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:03.463 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But he
reported one time at least

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
of seeing several UFO's
and he photographed them.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.568 align:middle line:90%
Tell us that story.

00:11:08.568 --> 00:11:09.669 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:10.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Well
you're actually talking

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:13.072 align:middle line:84%
about two different stories
that he was involved in.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:14.407 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:16.876 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Because I first
interviewed Gordon in 1975

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:20.379 align:middle line:84%
for my album and that was,
I believe, the first time

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:24.417 align:middle line:84%
that he had agreed to
go public on his beliefs

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.452 align:middle line:90%
and experiences with UFO's.

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:30.389 align:middle line:84%
And he said that when he was a
fighter pilot in the late 50's

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.525 align:middle line:90%
in Germany, he was stationed.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:36.129 align:middle line:84%
One day they all
saw these groups

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:41.868 align:middle line:84%
of circular objects coming over
the base in specific patterns,

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:46.072 align:middle line:84%
formations, and he and other
pilots were sent out to try

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.173 align:middle line:90%
and get close to them.

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:48.474 align:middle line:84%
And he said we could
never get close enough

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:49.876 align:middle line:90%
to them to pin them down.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:50.843 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
They were too fast.

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:51.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: They
were too fast.

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:54.614 align:middle line:84%
They were always able
to out maneuver us.

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:57.583 align:middle line:84%
And that was that
particular story.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:00.119 align:middle line:84%
So I said well was there
any other time you had

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:00.787 align:middle line:90%
any encounters?

00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:02.088 align:middle line:90%
He said yes.

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:05.591 align:middle line:84%
When he was a flight manager
at Edwards Air Force Base.

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.561 align:middle line:84%
And one day he had a flight
crew out on the dry lake bed

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.762 align:middle line:90%
and they were doing some work

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:12.131 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing some
photographing and filming.

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And he got a call
from one of the guys

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.304 align:middle line:84%
and they said something
is about to land out here.

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
It's circular and we don't
know what to do about it.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.574 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh boy.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.775 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:24.177 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And the
thing came out of the sky.

00:12:24.177 --> 00:12:29.215 align:middle line:84%
It was a typical flying saucer,
maybe 20, 25 feet in diameter.

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:31.484 align:middle line:84%
These three tripod
type legs came out.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:33.019 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: They all
had tripods, didn't they?

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:33.953 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Back then, yeah,

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:35.855 align:middle line:84%
either tripods or
little modules.

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:36.923 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:37.957 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Depending
on the models.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:39.492 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] George
Noory: That's right.

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:41.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Before the
triangular UFO's decided

00:12:41.394 --> 00:12:42.495 align:middle line:90%
to take over.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:45.631 align:middle line:84%
But this thing came
down, just sat there.

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:49.101 align:middle line:84%
And Gordon said you've got
cameras, start filming.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.303 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:12:50.303 --> 00:12:52.939 align:middle line:84%
And the films were
all sent to Gordon.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
He looked at the films.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.975 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him and
then what happened?

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:58.978 align:middle line:84%
He said I was ordered to
pack them up, ship them out

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:00.613 align:middle line:84%
and they were sent
to Washington,

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.048 align:middle line:90%
never to be seen again.

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:03.416 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
you're looking at him during

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.352 align:middle line:84%
that interview saying
is he making this up?

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Is he pulling my leg?

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.088 align:middle line:90%
But he wasn't, was he?

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: No.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.726 align:middle line:84%
Listen, it was during the same
interview that he was telling me

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:19.031 align:middle line:84%
about that he knows scientists
who were, and this was 1975,

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:22.435 align:middle line:84%
who were working on real
strong theories of how

00:13:22.435 --> 00:13:24.136 align:middle line:90%
to build a time machine.

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:25.304 align:middle line:90%
Like oh my God.

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:27.039 align:middle line:84%
I mean another one
of my passions.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:29.642 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The field
of ufology has been really,

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.044 align:middle line:90%
I think, your staple, hasn't it?

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:33.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes.

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:35.581 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've written
about many other things,

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:84%
including one particular topic
that I can't prove but I'm one

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.988 align:middle line:84%
of those people who
happens to believe

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:45.224 align:middle line:84%
that there might still be
prehistoric beasts running

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.726 align:middle line:90%
around on this planet.

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:47.827 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Like dinosaurs?

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:48.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Like
dinosaurs, specifically.

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.096 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I agree with that.

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:51.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: It is an area,
I wrote a story about this

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:56.969 align:middle line:84%
in the old Omni Magazine where
teams of scientists have gone

00:13:56.969 --> 00:14:02.508 align:middle line:84%
into a specific area of Congo
and have followed the lead

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:06.012 align:middle line:90%
of missionaries and pygmies.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.213 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Eyewitness reports.

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:08.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes,
exactly, eyewitness reports

00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:12.418 align:middle line:84%
from Pygmy tribes who have
no contact with each other

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:15.888 align:middle line:84%
because of the difficulty
of getting to each other

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:19.158 align:middle line:84%
and they all seem to
report what appears

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:24.297 align:middle line:84%
to be a large Sauropod
or like brontosaurus.

00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:28.234 align:middle line:84%
You know elephant body,
long neck, long tail

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:32.405 align:middle line:84%
and so these scientists
would go into these areas

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:34.507 align:middle line:84%
and they would bring
flash cards with them

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:37.677 align:middle line:84%
and on these flash cards
there'd be paintings or drawings

00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:39.111 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Of these dinosaurs.

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:41.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Of typical
dinosaurs, you know T Rex

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:45.451 align:middle line:84%
and triceratops and animals
that we know are indigenous

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:84%
to the area and they
would show these pictures.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.587 align:middle line:90%
Do you know this?

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:49.956 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever seen this?

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:52.959 align:middle line:84%
And every time they showed them
a picture of a brontosaurus,

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
oh yeah, that's [foreign
language].

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.296 align:middle line:84%
Another tribe would say, oh
that's [foreign language].

00:14:57.296 --> 00:15:00.433 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Yeah, yeah,
they've all seen it, separately

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:01.467 align:middle line:90%
but they've all seen it.

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:02.835 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:05.972 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: So eyewitness
testimony holds up in court.

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:07.506 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's a huge planet.

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:08.074 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal.

00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:11.377 align:middle line:84%
We have no, I mean scientists
are discovering things

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:14.413 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of lakes
and oceans in Antarctica,

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:17.149 align:middle line:84%
life forms that we never
could have conceived,

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:20.453 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of things that may
be discovered under the ice

00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:22.254 align:middle line:84%
of Europa, one of
Jupiter's moons.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:23.656 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: That's
right, same thing.

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:27.193 align:middle line:84%
I'm still obsessed with
the hollow earth theory.

00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:30.863 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean that's
fascinating all by itself.

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:33.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: I know
and I believe in that too.

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:36.369 align:middle line:84%
You and I are getting
into trouble here

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:90%
because people are going

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.305 align:middle line:84%
to think what are these
guys talking about?

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:90%
You know can they prove this?

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.244 align:middle line:84%
Well I'll tell you a story
at some point, maybe today,

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:48.381 align:middle line:84%
about scientists coming up
with an asinine statement

00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:50.783 align:middle line:90%
that would require proof.

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.551 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Okay,
why don't you tell me now?

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:53.552 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: I'll
tell you now

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:56.222 align:middle line:84%
because this just
recently happened.

00:15:56.222 --> 00:16:02.028 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of September
there was over in Lincoln,

00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:06.165 align:middle line:84%
Nebraska during the
morning weather report the

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:09.035 align:middle line:84%
meteorologist, a guy
named Sean McMullen,

00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:11.203 align:middle line:90%
was on air live doing a report.

00:16:11.203 --> 00:16:15.174 align:middle line:84%
And behind him they had
what's called the tower cam.

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.076 align:middle line:84%
And while he was
doing the report,

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:18.844 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden the
tower cam picks

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:21.914 align:middle line:84%
up some object that's just
suddenly hovering there,

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:84%
twinkling and moving
back and forth.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.184 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:26.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Changing
colors and he sees it

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:29.021 align:middle line:84%
and he stops his regular report
and he says what is this?

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:31.924 align:middle line:84%
Folks take a good look at this
and see if we can zoom in on it.

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:36.996 align:middle line:84%
And it instantly created
a stir there in Lincoln.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:41.667 align:middle line:84%
And then about like a week later
it started getting more coverage

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.503 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing follow
up reports, follow up updates

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:46.672 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I
heard about it.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.075 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote a story.

00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:52.978 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that really irked
me more than anything else,

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:57.149 align:middle line:84%
this is what I think is one
of the problems of ufology

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:59.585 align:middle line:84%
and people who are you
know self-made experts

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:05.024 align:middle line:84%
and who make claims, the
on air reporter said,

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:10.262 align:middle line:84%
right after the show, she said
I just spoke with the professor

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:13.466 align:middle line:84%
of physics and astronomy at
the University of Nebraska

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:20.038 align:middle line:84%
at Lincoln who says "I
guarantee extra-terrestrials do

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:21.574 align:middle line:90%
not exist".

00:17:21.574 --> 00:17:23.409 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I guarantee.

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:24.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Exactly.

00:17:24.442 --> 00:17:27.645 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the
report I went what?

00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:29.281 align:middle line:90%
What did this guy say?

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:32.384 align:middle line:84%
I mean have his superiors had
a conversation with him now?

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And then all the comments
starting coming in.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.654 align:middle line:90%
Who is this guy?

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:36.756 align:middle line:90%
How can he say that?

00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:39.125 align:middle line:84%
And in my story I
basically wrote

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:42.461 align:middle line:84%
where the late Carl Sagan
had said extraordinary claims

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:43.963 align:middle line:90%
require extraordinary evidence.

00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:46.365 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Yes he had and
he was a believer, by the way.

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:47.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes.

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:48.501 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Extra terrestrially.

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:50.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And
I ended my story

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.605 align:middle line:84%
by saying this physics
professor,

00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:56.642 align:middle line:84%
this whole story means that the
burden of proof, when it comes

00:17:56.642 --> 00:18:00.646 align:middle line:84%
to UFO stuff, doesn't
just solely rely

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:02.314 align:middle line:84%
on the shoulders
of the believers.

00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:05.651 align:middle line:84%
If this guy says that there
are no extra-terrestrials

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:06.752 align:middle line:90%
and he guarantees it.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.187 align:middle line:90%
Let's hear it.

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:08.954 align:middle line:90%
Come forward.

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:10.055 align:middle line:90%
And there's been nothing.

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:84%
There's been no statement
from him.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.192 align:middle line:84%
You can't say I guarantee
something

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:14.593 align:middle line:84%
without being able
to back it up.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.095 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I want to talk
with you about that but let's go

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.998 align:middle line:84%
to a phone call here,
Lee, and see what we have.

00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:22.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey Lee, I wondered what
age you were first interested

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.336 align:middle line:90%
in ufology?

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:30.109 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Well you know
to be really honest growing

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:35.214 align:middle line:84%
up my favorite movies were
all those black and white

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:36.649 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The Day
the Earth Stood Still,

00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:38.017 align:middle line:90%
all that stuff.

00:18:38.017 --> 00:18:39.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Earth versus
the Flying Saucers, you know,

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:44.123 align:middle line:84%
the movie that scared me
the most when I was nine

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.559 align:middle line:84%
or 10 years old,
Invaders from Mars.

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.893 align:middle line:90%
I had nightmares.

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:49.728 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What
about The Mysterians?

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:50.563 align:middle line:90%
Remember that one?

00:18:50.563 --> 00:18:51.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Nobody knows,

00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:52.898 align:middle line:84%
how do you know about
the Mysterians?

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: My father
brought me to it in the movies.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.437 align:middle line:84%
He would bring me, Lee, to
every science fiction movie

00:18:58.437 --> 00:18:59.805 align:middle line:90%
that was out.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:03.075 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, that's what
they produced and especially

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.277 align:middle line:90%
out of Japan, you know.

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:06.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: I know.

00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:09.281 align:middle line:84%
One thing about the Myserians
that always bothered,

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:11.684 align:middle line:84%
because it's a classic
movie, it's a schlock movie,

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:13.619 align:middle line:84%
but every time they
showed the Mysterians,

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:15.154 align:middle line:90%
they were all Japanese.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.255 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:17.489 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: All
of them, all of them.

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:18.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And I
thought well wait a minute,

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.024 align:middle line:90%
this is what aliens look like?

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:19.892 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Gorgo?

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Remember that one?

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Yeah,
Gorgo, that was

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And then
Gorgo fought another one.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:25.531 align:middle line:90%
What was the name of the

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:26.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Do
you mean Godzilla?

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:27.499 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Godzilla.

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:28.734 align:middle line:90%
Who was Gorgo?

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.669 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Gorgo
was a movie

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:84%
about like a large T Rex kind
of creature that was found

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.911 align:middle line:84%
and brought to London to be
put on display and while it was

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:44.216 align:middle line:84%
on display his mother, that was
somewhere else and much bigger,

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:45.618 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Was looking for him.

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Was looking for
him and found her way to London

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.855 align:middle line:90%
to rescue her offspring.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:50.956 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Godzilla but you're right,

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:53.926 align:middle line:84%
they were all Japanese
and they all stemmed

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:55.961 align:middle line:90%
after the atomic bomb.

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:57.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes.

00:19:57.263 --> 00:19:59.565 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And their
theories were bizarre things

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:03.502 align:middle line:84%
could happen later and
they all kept cropping up,

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.237 align:middle line:90%
all those kinds of movies.

00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:06.171 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And
you know what's weird

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
about that whole
atomic bomb thing?

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.275 align:middle line:90%
I still didn't understand,

00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:14.813 align:middle line:84%
even today when a UFO has
allegedly landed somewhere

00:20:14.813 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and the military or other people
have gone out to check it out,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.852 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
things they seem

00:20:19.852 --> 00:20:22.388 align:middle line:84%
to do is let's check
it for radiation.

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:27.559 align:middle line:84%
Why? Why are we assuming there's
some kind of radiation involved

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:28.827 align:middle line:90%
that could destroy us?

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:31.096 align:middle line:84%
Just like what you said
about those creatures,

00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:32.564 align:middle line:90%
what kind of radiation?

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:34.466 align:middle line:84%
Are they expecting
that the UFO came

00:20:34.466 --> 00:20:37.336 align:middle line:84%
through the Van Allen belt
somehow and picked up some

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:40.339 align:middle line:84%
out of space radiation and is
bringing it with him, yeah?

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:44.843 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Remember the
thing about the huge ants?

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Oh Them.

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:49.782 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Them,
and what's the thing?

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:51.383 align:middle line:90%
I've got the titles right.

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:52.518 align:middle line:90%
I've got the movies wrong.

00:20:52.518 --> 00:20:53.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: I
know, the Thing,

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
there were two versions
of the Thing.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.191 align:middle line:84%
The original one which starred
very tall, James Arness,

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:00.159 align:middle line:90%
remember he was on Gunsmoke?

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.427 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:02.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: He played
Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke?

00:21:02.795 --> 00:21:06.598 align:middle line:84%
He played the Thing and he was
the sole occupant apparently

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:08.334 align:middle line:90%
of this flying saucer.

00:21:08.334 --> 00:21:11.103 align:middle line:84%
That it crashed in the
arctic and it had been buried

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.705 align:middle line:90%
in the ice for a long time.

00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:14.073 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I love that.

00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:16.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And so the team
of scientists went up there

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:20.713 align:middle line:84%
and they uncovered it,
brought his ice enclosed body

00:21:20.713 --> 00:21:23.482 align:middle line:90%
into their base there.

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:25.317 align:middle line:84%
When of course something
went wrong.

00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:27.186 align:middle line:84%
The temperature went
up, the ice melted.

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:30.589 align:middle line:84%
He got out and started
killing people.

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:32.324 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
also remember one,

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:37.329 align:middle line:84%
I think it was called The First
Man into Space where he was

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:41.033 align:middle line:84%
in like a special plane
and he went too far

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:43.202 align:middle line:90%
and he went into space.

00:21:43.202 --> 00:21:45.838 align:middle line:84%
But then he came
down but he changed.

00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:49.408 align:middle line:84%
He became evil and
something happened to him.

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:50.642 align:middle line:90%
Those were classics.

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:53.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: I
loved those movies.

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:57.416 align:middle line:84%
My most favorite movie of all
time, in the same bane of you

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:00.018 align:middle line:84%
and I talking about,
the movie I've seen more

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:03.756 align:middle line:84%
than anything else, the
original 1933 King Kong.

00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:05.124 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh yes.

00:22:05.124 --> 00:22:05.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Because this was

00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:07.126 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: A classic.

00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:09.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: The first
notion that I ever had

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:11.263 align:middle line:84%
that there could
be places on earth

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:12.564 align:middle line:84%
where there could
still be dinosaurs.

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:13.699 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:15.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: It just
captured my attention.

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:17.703 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Did
you like Jurassic Park?

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:18.404 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Well yeah.

00:22:18.404 --> 00:22:19.538 align:middle line:90%
I have them all on DVD.

00:22:19.538 --> 00:22:22.241 align:middle line:84%
I have a sense Stephen
Spielberg maybe wanting

00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:23.308 align:middle line:90%
to do a fourth one.

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:24.676 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Oh
that would be great.

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Yeah I love
how the technology kept getting

00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:90%
better and better.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.418 align:middle line:84%
Sure, loved, for some
reason I will occasionally

00:22:32.418 --> 00:22:33.786 align:middle line:90%
have nightmares.

00:22:33.786 --> 00:22:35.921 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of the night I
will be in the middle of a dream

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:40.292 align:middle line:84%
where I am being chased
in a city somewhere

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:42.294 align:middle line:90%
by a tyrannosaurus Rex.

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:44.596 align:middle line:84%
And it only seems
to be targeting me.

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:46.365 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I wonder what
our dream ladies would say,

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:47.199 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: I don't know.

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.067 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's great.

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:51.303 align:middle line:84%
Then the evolution
of television came.

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:55.507 align:middle line:84%
Black and white,
science fiction theatre,

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:56.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes.

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:57.976 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The Twilight
Zone, One Step Beyond,

00:22:57.976 --> 00:23:00.612 align:middle line:90%
Outer Limits, classics.

00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:03.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: One Step Beyond
was like the Twilight Zone

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:06.385 align:middle line:84%
in that every week they
had different stories

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:07.953 align:middle line:84%
of the mysterious
and the bizarre.

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:11.123 align:middle line:84%
And the difference between the
two, where the Twilight Zone,

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
hosted by Rod Sterling,
dealt with fictitious made

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.562 align:middle line:84%
up stories just to kind
of freak everyone out,

00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: But its
counterpart, One Step Beyond,

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:23.068 align:middle line:84%
dealt with real reported
stories of the paranormal.

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.436 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Stuff we had heard

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:26.438 align:middle line:84%
about from the Floridian Times
and things like that, right?

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:27.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Exactly.

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:32.478 align:middle line:84%
And when I was putting that
UFO album together in 1975,

00:23:32.478 --> 00:23:36.114 align:middle line:84%
deciding who I wanted the
host of the album to be,

00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:39.418 align:middle line:84%
I first contacted
Rod Sterling's family

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:42.421 align:middle line:84%
and they said he
was a little too ill

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:43.555 align:middle line:90%
at that point with cancer.

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:44.623 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Yeah
and then he died at 50.

00:23:44.623 --> 00:23:46.024 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And
then he died.

00:23:46.024 --> 00:23:50.496 align:middle line:84%
And so my other second option
was that guy that I always used

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:52.798 align:middle line:84%
to love who was the on
camera host and director

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.967 align:middle line:84%
of One Step Beyond,
John Newland.

00:23:54.967 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I found out he's still
directing in Hollywood.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:84%
We met when I went to California
and over a handshake deal

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.609 align:middle line:84%
at lunch he said I'd
love to be your narrator.

00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:04.176 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Wow.

00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:05.577 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal.

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:09.515 align:middle line:84%
He came to New York and we did
an on camera two minute video

00:24:09.515 --> 00:24:12.684 align:middle line:84%
where he pitched the
UFO album for CBS.

00:24:12.684 --> 00:24:15.153 align:middle line:90%
This was just unheard of.

00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:17.155 align:middle line:84%
No one had ever done
anything like this on TV,

00:24:17.155 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:90%
to pitch a UFO product.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.058 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right, exactly.

00:24:20.058 --> 00:24:22.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: And I had the
producer so that it would look

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:25.497 align:middle line:84%
like the beginning of an
original One Step Beyond episode

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:26.999 align:middle line:84%
where he used to come
out and start talking.

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:28.166 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: He'd come
out and start talking.

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:29.368 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: He's great.

00:24:29.368 --> 00:24:30.736 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And what
happened to the pitch?

00:24:30.736 --> 00:24:31.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: The
pitch did well.

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:33.772 align:middle line:84%
We sold a lot of records
around the country.

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:37.676 align:middle line:84%
It was also being sold on of
course the National Enquirer

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:40.512 align:middle line:84%
and lovely publications like
that but it did a good job.

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:42.214 align:middle line:90%
People liked the idea.

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:45.484 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while, CBS
wasn't making enough money

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:47.586 align:middle line:84%
and they just reverted
the rights back

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:50.222 align:middle line:84%
to my executive producer
and myself.

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:56.461 align:middle line:84%
But it was a thing that launched
me into this whole UFO field

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:59.531 align:middle line:90%
because Alan Hynek said

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Who by the
way became a believer in you.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.968 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Oh yes.

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:04.202 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Just so people know.

00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:05.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Yeah he
wasn't just swamp casting it

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:07.906 align:middle line:90%
until the end of his life.

00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:11.443 align:middle line:84%
He was so happy with
how this ad turned out.

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:13.412 align:middle line:84%
He wanted it to be
made available

00:25:13.412 --> 00:25:16.348 align:middle line:84%
to educational facilities
and he did

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:84%
that through the
setup of UFO studies.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.484 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's great.

00:25:19.484 --> 00:25:21.853 align:middle line:84%
You know that turn
around that he did.

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:84%
He was a consultant as you
said for Project Blue Book.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.927 align:middle line:84%
He was the debunker and he went
around the country doing that.

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:32.064 align:middle line:84%
And I think he said
once it was my job.

00:25:32.064 --> 00:25:33.532 align:middle line:90%
That's what I had to do.

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:34.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:36.201 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What was
his turning point, Lee?

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you think turned him

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.807 align:middle line:84%
from being a skeptic
to a believer?

00:25:41.807 --> 00:25:45.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: I don't
think it was any one case.

00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It probably more had
to do with he was

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.984 align:middle line:84%
on so many committees,
The Robertson Panel.

00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:54.152 align:middle line:90%
And he was a consultant

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:57.923 align:middle line:84%
on the government's [inaudible]
committee from project Blue Book

00:25:57.923 --> 00:26:04.062 align:middle line:84%
and Hynek used to say that he
just kept seeing things go bad,

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:07.065 align:middle line:84%
especially when he was the
consultant for the Air Force.

00:26:07.065 --> 00:26:09.701 align:middle line:84%
He was told to go
out and debunk things

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:11.503 align:middle line:90%
and he couldn't debunk them.

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:13.405 align:middle line:84%
And he did it because
he was told to do it

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:15.374 align:middle line:84%
and it was what they
were paying him for.

00:26:15.374 --> 00:26:19.478 align:middle line:84%
And you know you and I on one of
my earlier appearances on Coast

00:26:19.478 --> 00:26:24.149 align:middle line:84%
to Coast, I read some
portions of this chapter

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:26.118 align:middle line:84%
from an old Air Force
Academy physics book

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:29.187 align:middle line:84%
and over the year you said you
thought this was a possible

00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:29.888 align:middle line:90%
smoking gun.

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:31.223 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:26:31.223 --> 00:26:34.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: In 1968 the
Air Force had a book called

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:36.762 align:middle line:90%
Introductory Space Science.

00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:41.233 align:middle line:84%
It was a textbook for physics
for the academy cadets.

00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:45.437 align:middle line:84%
One chapter simply titled
Unidentified Flying Objects.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.838 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Exactly.

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:49.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Lengthy chapter,
it just opening up all the stuff

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:51.209 align:middle line:90%
that they suspected was going

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:54.279 align:middle line:84%
on with UFO's going
back 50,000 years

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:59.317 align:middle line:84%
and they kept concluding things
like the most simulating belief

00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:04.056 align:middle line:84%
for us is that some UFO's may
be intelligently controlled

00:27:04.056 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial spacecraft
manned by several groups

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.596 align:middle line:84%
of aliens at different
stages of development.

00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:14.666 align:middle line:84%
Well what are you supposed
to believe when you read this

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:17.269 align:middle line:84%
and it's in an official
physics book?

00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:21.973 align:middle line:84%
And skeptics would say well it's
just conjecture and speculation.

00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:26.578 align:middle line:84%
Well wait a minute, speculation
based on things that they know.

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:31.516 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't want to fill their
cadets with these kinds of ideas

00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:34.653 align:middle line:84%
if there wasn't some
truth to it or some basis.

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:35.887 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:27:35.887 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's
phenomenal what's out there.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.692 align:middle line:84%
As we were talking
about Carl Sagan,

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:43.895 align:middle line:84%
a believer in extraterrestrial
life, was not a believer

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:47.733 align:middle line:84%
that we have been
visited, but I do.

00:27:47.733 --> 00:27:49.701 align:middle line:90%
I think you do too.

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:51.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yes.

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we've been
visited for a very long time.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:00.212 align:middle line:84%
And I personally can't prove
it so I don't go out of my way

00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
to come off like a
blowhard and say yes,

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.849 align:middle line:84%
you know of course
we were visited.

00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:07.452 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's enough
evidence, anecdotal evidence,

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:84%
circumstantial evidence,
historical evidence and okay,

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.926 align:middle line:84%
you know, the thing that
nails it for most people is

00:28:14.926 --> 00:28:16.795 align:middle line:84%
when you have your own
very close encounter,

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:19.965 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to get away from it
and I've had my own encounter.

00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:22.968 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You did and
it changed you, didn't it?

00:28:22.968 --> 00:28:24.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: I don't know
if it changed me, George.

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:29.007 align:middle line:84%
It just reaffirmed
it all for me.

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
You could take a group of
10 people, line them up

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:36.214 align:middle line:84%
and ask the group, what would
it take for you to believe

00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:90%
that UFO's, some UFO's,

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.584 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Exist.

00:28:39.584 --> 00:28:40.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: As
Stan Freidman says,

00:28:40.786 --> 00:28:44.089 align:middle line:84%
that some UFO's are
extra-terrestrial in origin?

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:90%
What would it take?

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:46.958 align:middle line:84%
And you'd get 10
different answers.

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Some people would say
oh I want one to land

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.061 align:middle line:90%
on the White House lawn.

00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:52.464 align:middle line:84%
I want the United Nations
to make an announcement.

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:55.167 align:middle line:84%
I want the president to
make an announcement.

00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:57.769 align:middle line:90%
I want to have my own encounter.

00:28:57.769 --> 00:29:00.172 align:middle line:84%
I want them to appear
over major cities.

00:29:00.172 --> 00:29:01.773 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And if they
don't, I'm not doing to believe.

00:29:01.773 --> 00:29:02.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Lee Speigal: Yeah.

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:06.444 align:middle line:84%
So it's really difficult
to get people to believe

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:08.747 align:middle line:84%
if they're already
pre-dispositioned not

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:10.115 align:middle line:90%
to believe.

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:14.653 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, based on a new
Huffington Post Yougov poll

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:20.759 align:middle line:84%
that we just conducted recently,
48% of adult Americans believe

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:26.398 align:middle line:84%
that some people have had
experiences with ET related

00:29:26.398 --> 00:29:28.033 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Directly, directly

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:33.104 align:middle line:84%
and I believe the belief system
is even higher that they exist.

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.472 align:middle line:84%
Lee, thanks for being
on Beyond Belief.

00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:35.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Thank
you, George.

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:36.608 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You know,

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:84%
ever since I was a boy
I've been a believer

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.747 align:middle line:84%
in extraterrestrial life, in
the unusual, the paranormal.

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:44.816 align:middle line:84%
It's great to talk to
people like Lee Speigal

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:46.818 align:middle line:90%
who research it, write it

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:48.587 align:middle line:84%
and then let the
world know about it.

00:29:48.587 --> 00:29:50.288 align:middle line:90%
Lee Speigal on Beyond Belief.

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:51.923 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again, appreciate it.

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:53.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee Speigal: Thank
you, George.

00:29:53.491 --> 00:30:11.209 align:middle line:90%
