00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.578 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: When you regress
people, what do they say?

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHELLEY KAEHR: Pictures,
thoughts, and feelings

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.970 align:middle line:90%
start to emerge.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation just
made sense to me then

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.050 align:middle line:90%
and it continues to make sense.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there's
past trauma, Shelley,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.783 align:middle line:84%
does that come
forward in this life?

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Absolutely it does.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:84%
There are scientific studies
that prove that up to 50%

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
of our actual personality is
being brought through our DNA.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.265 align:middle line:90%
50%

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: It's huge.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.612 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond belief.

00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is beyond belief.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.875 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:10%
For two decades, world-renowned
past life regressionist,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Shelley Kaehr, PhD has
worked with thousands of people

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.910 align:middle line:10%
all around the
world, helping them

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:10%
achieve greater peace and
happiness in their own lives.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:90%
How does she do it?

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Shelley, welcome to the program.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.905 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: George, thank
you so much for having me.

00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:08.322 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by
the way, thank you

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
for what you do because you
have helped a lot of people.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I get so much response
when you're on the radio

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:90%
show with me.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:84%
After the fact, the people
who have talked to you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and called you or
go to your website,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:90%
they feel that connection.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:90%
You do a marvelous job for them.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:84%
On behalf of the
human race, thank you.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Thank you.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
I'd say the same for you.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
The things you've done
through this program.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We need people
like you though to make

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:90%
my show successful.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:90%
So that's important.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in this?

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Helping--

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: It's been--

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.217 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --people like this?

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: --a lifelong
interest of mine.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in Colorado
Springs part of the time,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:90%
and my mother attended--

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a Colorado girl.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:10%
And my mother actually
attended a luncheon

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:10%
with the man who wrote the book,
"The Search for Bridey Murphy."

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Classic book.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous past life
regression cases in history.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And so she bought the
book and brought it home

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:90%
when I was a kid.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.257 align:middle line:90%
I read it and I was just hooked.

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mesmerized by it.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.014 align:middle line:90%
I could see how that happened.

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, there weren't
a lot of stories of past lives.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:90%
They weren't out there a lot.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
home run, I think.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.795 align:middle line:90%
And "Seth Speaks," that was--

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --another one.

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: God, I love that.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get
involved in reincarnation?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Do you get involved in
all kinds of things?

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
What are your thoughts
on reincarnation?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:90%
What do you think it is?

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:10%
>>KAEHR: I really have always
believed in reincarnation

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:10%
probably because of
my own past lives.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have many?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:90%
I know that I've been in India.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I've been in India
in this lifetime,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:84%
but when I went there,
I had a deep sense

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:90%
that I have been there before.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody thinks they
were a famous past person.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.205 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: I don't.

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
one of the things,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.413 align:middle line:84%
when I'm doing the
therapy for other people,

00:02:54.413 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
too, is that I've never found
myself to be anyone famous.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And most of the clients
I work with are not.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.110 align:middle line:90%
They're just regular people.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.902 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
reasons why I thought

00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:90%
it was more valid, you know.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.782 align:middle line:84%
Because not everybody is going
to be some famous person.

00:03:06.782 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Bruce
Goldberg says, I

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:84%
was one of the architects
of the pyramids.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Wow.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That probably makes
me an extraterrestrial.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Probably.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or something like that.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I could
see that about you.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.715 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, anyway, so you
do believe in reincarnation?

00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: I do.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you regress
people, what do they say?

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Well they go, you
know, they're coming in usually

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:90%
with a challenge.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Normally, they don't
come just because things

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:90%
are going wonderfully.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: So we're
trying to get there

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In their life.

00:03:37.648 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Yes, in
their current life.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of times,
they've been to therapy,

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.783 align:middle line:84%
they've been through
all these other things.

00:03:42.783 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, a lot of times
I'm the last resort.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.020 align:middle line:84%
They just need something
to make sense for them.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So we guide them back into
these past experiences.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I ask people these
questions that most of them

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
have never been asked
before, pictures, thoughts,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.473 align:middle line:90%
and feelings start to emerge.

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Even I was talking to someone
before the program who said,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:84%
wow, I had a
regression once but it

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
felt like I was making
these things up.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
common occurrence.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:84%
But these feelings and thoughts
come from something very deep

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:90%
within the soul.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And so if I say, well OK, you
were there in the Middle Ages.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.339 align:middle line:84%
So this thing that
you just described,

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:84%
how does this apply to what I'm
doing here in my current life?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:90%
And they all can tell me.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, as long as that
then becomes something

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that is a tool to make their
current life more peaceful,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
then that is a very powerful
thing for people to do.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we need
regression in order for them

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:90%
to remember their past lives?

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we just
remember them now?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I think we
actually can remember them.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I've done some research on
spontaneous past life memories.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: But I think largely
that the population is not--

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.120 align:middle line:84%
they're not consciously aware
that that's what's happening.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
You have, like, intuition,
or you get a strange feeling

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:84%
when you meet someone
or while traveling.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:90%
This happens a lot.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And so usually, people
need the regression

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:84%
to go more consciously
into those past events.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.518 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, you're
thinking of them just

00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:90%
going through daily life.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find,
Shelley, that you

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
cure people from
afflictions or hang-ups

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
by going back into their past
life and bringing it out?

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I guess I try not
to use the word "cure,"

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:84%
unless I'm making a
joke, because, I guess--

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or help.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Help.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say help.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, again,
sometimes it's just

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:84%
getting a different
perspective on the situation.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I'll use the Middle Ages again.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
They went to the Middle
Ages, they saw this scene,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:84%
they've looked at their own
life through this new lens,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.393 align:middle line:84%
and just that shift just
instantly changes everything.

00:05:46.393 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And makes them
feel more peaceful.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I talked with
author and hypnotherapist

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Georgina Cannon on the
program about past lives

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:90%
and why they don't lie.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:10%
Are you convinced that the
past lives that you pick up

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:10%
from people after you put them
under, are real or are they

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.913 align:middle line:10%
making these things up?

00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGINA CANNON:
I don't believe

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:10%
you can make up emotions.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And most, I would say,
80% of the past lives

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
include some emotion of some
sort, either joy or sadness,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
fear, sorrow, you
can't make that up.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're so impactful
that they make a difference.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
When someone comes back into
today, they say, oh, my God.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Now I know why I
have a fear of water,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and now I know why I keep
choosing people like I do.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or why I have
a mole on my face.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:10%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Chances are
that carries through.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:10%
>>CANNON: Yes.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How many past lives
can an individual have?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: In my case,
probably eight or nine.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:90%
But I'm sure there's many more.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure--

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they could be lives
that last full term, right?

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
80, 85 years old.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Or they could be-- maybe
they died early in birth,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:90%
or who knows.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CANNON: And they could
also come from other planets.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:90%
They don't necessarily--

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:10%
>>CANNON: Oh, yes.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.608 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
come from this planet.

00:07:04.608 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shelley,
you agree with her?

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.734 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: I do agree with her--

00:07:06.734 --> 00:07:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They could--

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: --on that.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --come from other
planets and everything else.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Oh, yes.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Could you have been an animal?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:84%
My past lives with pets,
some of those people

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
were reporting their
lives as animals.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.355 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about reincarnation?

00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:90%
What does your gut tell you?

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I just feel like, as
souls-- even from the minute I

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:84%
heard about the Bridey
Murphy case when I was a kid,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.050 align:middle line:84%
it just didn't make sense
to me that we would be here

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:84%
on this earth for such
a short period of time.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation just
made sense to me then

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:90%
and it continues to make sense.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
thought of reincarnation

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
as a process of reaching
perfection, or heaven, that you

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:84%
keep coming back until you
get to that heavenly state.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And by the mere fact that people
are listening to this program

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and watching it, people
like you are into it,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:middle line:90%
has elevated you to--

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:84%
you're probably not going
to reincarnate anymore,

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:90%
because you're at that level.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.373 align:middle line:90%
You're close now.

00:08:10.373 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: I don't know.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
You know I hear that a
lot of people go, well,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:90%
this is my last life.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well,
I don't know, I'm

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.585 align:middle line:84%
kind of enjoying the
life that I'm having.

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.603 align:middle line:84%
But you might enjoy the
supernatural life, too.

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Yes, I could
be floating around

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:90%
on a cloud bubble.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that would be fun.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.727 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With a heart.

00:08:27.727 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Playing music.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that boring?

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.894 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: It seems
kind of boring.

00:08:32.894 --> 00:08:33.374 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:08:33.374 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I think
we do come here,

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
you know-- when
things are going well,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:84%
that's when a lot
of times people

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:84%
will make things get
messed up, I guess,

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
to get some excitement
in their lives.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often does things
like that change for people?

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:84%
When they come back
again and again,

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do they want to go back?

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Like you just said, you
kind of like this life.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a choice?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I definitely believe we
make the choice, yes, before we

00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:90%
get here.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You pick your family?

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: We pick our family.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.155 align:middle line:84%
We pick the people
we're meeting.

00:09:03.155 --> 00:09:06.460 align:middle line:84%
We pick the circumstances so
that we can learn the lessons

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:90%
that we came here to learn.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you heal
yourself through regression?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: You can.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I think it, first, it
begins with the mindset.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Just changing the
mindset, looking

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.750 align:middle line:84%
at current reality in a new way
through the eyes of the past.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.997 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of
our secret cameras

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
has found you
performing a regression

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:90%
on one of your patients.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how you did.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.512 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: When I count to
three, the three of you

00:09:32.512 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
are going to float
all the way back

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:84%
to the source event
that would most help

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:90%
that side of the family tree.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.720 align:middle line:84%
One, floating back, back,
back, back, back in time.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Two, further and further and
further, you're almost there.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And three, [TONGUE CLICKS]
you're there.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Be there now, floating
down, down, down, down,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.650 align:middle line:84%
down, and down
into those events.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So what year is
this, the first thing

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:90%
that floats into your mind?

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NICOLE NOLAN: 1907.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Beautiful.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:90%
So how does it feel in 1907?

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOLAN: Like there's
chaos going on like crazy.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.215 align:middle line:90%
We're on a island.

00:10:22.215 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Very good.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.640 align:middle line:84%
As you sense the energy
of your ancestor,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.113 align:middle line:90%
is this a man or a woman?

00:10:35.113 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOLAN: It's a woman.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Very good.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.435 align:middle line:84%
And do you have a sense of
what's causing the chaos?

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOLAN: It feels like she's
being hit, like beaten.

00:10:51.695 --> 00:10:57.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:90%
She's scared.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Very good.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that
your spirit guide

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
is going to extend a beautiful
healing light to her.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.585 align:middle line:84%
That light's coming
down from above,

00:11:14.585 --> 00:11:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's getting brighter
and brighter and brighter

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.835 align:middle line:84%
and brighter and brighter
and brighter and brighter

00:11:18.835 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and brighter and brighter
and brighter and brighter.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Lighter and lighter
and lighter and lighter

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and lighter and lighter
and lighter and lighter.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Lighter.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So that it's
really, really light

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:90%
and really, really bright.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Lighter and lighter and lighter
and lighter and lighter.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Brighter and
brighter and brighter

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and brighter and
brighter and brighter

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.305 align:middle line:84%
and brighter and
brighter and brighter.

00:11:42.305 --> 00:11:43.105 align:middle line:90%
And lighter.

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:84%
In this light, you're just
moving over this chaos,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:84%
over this fear, and
it is easing her.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And let me know when this
situation feels lighter

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.472 align:middle line:90%
and better than it did before.

00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:06.805 align:middle line:90%
Lighter and lighter and lighter.

00:12:06.805 --> 00:12:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOLAN: OK, we're there.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long did it
take you to regress her?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.073 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: That was
about an hour, total.

00:12:24.073 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was two
minutes of about an hour.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that standard?

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Yes, about an
hour, hour and a half,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.680 align:middle line:90%
is standard, yes.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did she say anything
that just shocked you?

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:84%
This was a genealogical
regression,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:84%
so we were going
to scenes of things

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:90%
that happened to her ancestors.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things she told
me before the session began,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that happens unfortunately
quite a lot of the time,

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:84%
is that her mother always
told the whole family

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that they been snake-bit,
they are cursed.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
But during this whole process,
this whole regression,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.695 align:middle line:84%
there was never any
evidence to suggest that.

00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
feel that at all.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: No.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:90%
She didn't.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.215 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I tried to get her
to go to those places--

00:13:05.215 --> 00:13:05.487 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was Nolan--

00:13:05.487 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: --but she didn't.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --making
these things up?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I think,
sometimes, as you know,

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:84%
we have good things
that happen in our lives

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and we have bad
things that happen.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And if people are more
prone to pay more attention

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
to the darker stuff,
then you start

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
to notice that rather than the
good things that are happening.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
like a family healing?

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Yes, it was
a family healing.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to know, well,
there were two things.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:84%
One was that the
mother told them

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.010 align:middle line:90%
that the family was cursed.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Another was that a psychic
told her about some things that

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:84%
had happened in her
father's family lines.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So we were just going to
look down these two family

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:84%
lines to see what was
actually happening.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there's
past trauma, Shelley,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.205 align:middle line:84%
does that come
forward in this life?

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.413 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Absolutely, it does.

00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:84%
There are scientific studies
now that prove that up to 50%

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.950 align:middle line:84%
of our actual personality is
being brought through our DNA.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And so likewise, these
traumas from the past

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:84%
are being brought forth
from the DNA, as well.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you drowned
in another life,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.082 align:middle line:84%
are you afraid of swimming
in this life, or the water?

00:14:15.082 --> 00:14:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: It can happen.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.435 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:17.435 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:84%
But maybe, you've never
even been near a pool

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.852 align:middle line:84%
but you see one,
and all of a sudden,

00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
you're having a panic
attack for no reason.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
That can definitely
be caused by that.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then how do
you heal that person?

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.203 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:14:28.203 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Through the
process, I put them

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:90%
into a protective shell.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.970 align:middle line:84%
We go back to those events
and look at those scenes

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
from a safe vantage point and
bring healing and understanding

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:84%
to those things, release
unwanted influences.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had a woman who
was afraid of the water

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:90%
this last year.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.382 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are they
remarkably cured after that?

00:14:49.382 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: She did
go into a swimming

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:84%
pool for the first
time after the session.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without any tension?

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Well, I mean, she
was like, OK, a little bit.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.043 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still a little uptight.

00:14:58.043 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that's
still pretty dramatic.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: It's pretty
dramatic if you've never been

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:90%
able to get into a pool before.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody, let's
say, was stabbed to death

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.430 align:middle line:84%
in the stomach, would
they have a scar

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.017 align:middle line:90%
on their stomach in this life.

00:15:11.017 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: They could have a pain.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.880 align:middle line:84%
They could have birthmarks,
different scars,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:84%
or different strange
anomalies, or they could just

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:84%
have like an ache that's
coming from nowhere.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
They go to doctors, you know,
they can't find anything wrong.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many of them carry
things through from past lives?

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, would one
life lead to another?

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Or if somebody had six past
lives with things happening,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
would all six of
those come through?

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: It could
be different, yes.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all six of them could.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.780 align:middle line:90%
It could be one.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, I believe
that we are actually

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.935 align:middle line:84%
carrying quite a bit of stuff
through from our past lives.

00:15:46.935 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you were
talking about the challenges

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:90%
of families.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:58.230 align:middle line:84%
How does that affect the overall
reincarnation regression,

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
if your father had a
problem, if your mother had

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:90%
problems in past lives?

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And didn't we know each
other in past lives?

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Not you and me, but
I mean, didn't you

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:84%
know your family
members in a past life?

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I definitely
believe we have, yes.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I think we've
chosen our families.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.050 align:middle line:10%
They are people we've either
had past lives with before.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.412 align:middle line:10%
But then we also choose
our ancestors, as well,

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:10%
so there's some real soul
contracts at work here

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:10%
that need healing, they
need our attention.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever regressed
a family in a group session?

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Or is it always one-on-one?

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: I actually have.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I regressed a couple
at the same time.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:90%
It was an experiment.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it work?

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: It did, but I
think that the problem is

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:84%
that things come up and
maybe you don't really

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.572 align:middle line:90%
want your spouse to hear those.

00:16:48.572 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's probably
a little holding back

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
of the actual revelations
that could be happening,

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:84%
which is why I don't
normally encourage it.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever have
anybody cry in a regression?

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Oh gosh, yes.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.360 align:middle line:90%
So those emotions come through?

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you do?

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.657 align:middle line:84%
Do you get them out
of it real fast or--

00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: It depends.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:05.538 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --what do you do?

00:17:05.538 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I mean,
you know, you have

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:90%
to be able to hold the space.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:84%
If I'm having a problem
with somebody crying,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:84%
that's really more
about me, in my opinion.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So you have to hold the
space to let that out

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.680 align:middle line:90%
because it's an emotion.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of
the problem that we're

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.310 align:middle line:84%
having is when we stuff
those emotions down,

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.420 align:middle line:90%
then those can cause disease.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
let them cry it out

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
because it shifts the
energy, and then, just

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
reframe it and get them back
into, what I would call,

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:90%
a more productive state.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes crying
is really good.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shelley, are past lives
beneficial to people or not?

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:90%
At this point.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: If we understand
that we've had past lives,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:90%
that can be very beneficial.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I think when it's not is when
there's just things happening,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
maybe we have an ache,
or pain, or we're

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
having an emotional
outburst about something,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:90%
we don't understand why.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.518 align:middle line:84%
And then, that can
be very detrimental

00:17:58.518 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:84%
because people don't
understand where

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:90%
these impulses are coming from.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And by understanding
that many of them

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.338 align:middle line:84%
are coming from your
past lives and just need

00:18:06.338 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of attention, that
can be very transformational.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
how to attack something?

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.265 align:middle line:90%
In issue, for example?

00:18:14.265 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I have to use
a lot of my intuition.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.558 align:middle line:84%
I really try to-- you know,
that scene that we just looked

00:18:19.558 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:90%
at here, I've got my eyes open.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
But normally when I'm
working with a client,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:90%
I've got my eyes closed.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm concentrating,
and I'm almost

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
trying to go with
them on the journey

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:84%
so that I can really
see, OK, where

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.190 align:middle line:84%
do we need to go next to help
them really have the healing

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:90%
that they really need to have.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Therapist
Elmar Dornberger

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
appeared on the
"Healing Matrix" show

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and talked about
how science is just

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.720 align:middle line:84%
starting to catch up with
these ancestral healing issues.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:10%
>>ELMAR DORNBERGER: Person
named Bert Hellinger.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.030 align:middle line:10%
He's the founder
of this modality,

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:10%
And he used to live in Africa
and worked with the Zulus

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.120 align:middle line:10%
for many years.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:10%
And he noticed that when
there were issues in the tribe

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:10%
or in families, they would
always honor the ancestors.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:10%
So they would look
back to the ancestors

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:10%
and notice if there
was anything that

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:10%
might have been passed
from the ancestors

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:10%
to that particular
person or family.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:10%
So he noticed that there was
great worship done and honoring

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:10%
to the whole family lineage,
and actually to both the living

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.730 align:middle line:10%
and to the dead.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So he noticed that the
dead are not necessarily

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
no longer present.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So there was actually some kind
of an energy form still existed

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:90%
even in the present family.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And later on, he studied
many modalities actually here

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.940 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, and then,
he started combining them.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And so family constellation
is really a combination

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:90%
of different modalities.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But it did come from this idea
that patterns are being passed

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.828 align:middle line:90%
down to us from ancestors.

00:19:57.828 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Which makes total sense.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been thought that a
lot of our emotions and thought

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and so forth are
connected, and experience

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%
are connected in with the DNA.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So this would make sense that
we have inherited certain

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.070 align:middle line:84%
of these, maybe, deep
familial memories and patterns

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:90%
and behaviors.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DORNBERGER: Yes.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the
last 5 to 10 years,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:84%
science has almost kind of
caught up with this modality

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and been proven now
that the DNA actually

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
carries more than just
structural things, but also

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:90%
emotional aspects.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much of an effect
on your personality today

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:84%
have been your
ancestors from the past?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Real scientific
evidence is saying 50%.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: It's huge.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond belief.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.213 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is beyond belief.

00:20:54.213 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I guess it all depends on
what your ancestors are like.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes, I mean--

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could be
a blessing or a curse.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Or a little bit of both
is probably more like it.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it just
says that we need

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to be paying more
attention to our ancestors.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer
in global healing.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:84%
We need to be sending love
and light to all people.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I would just
encourage people

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
to put your ancestors
on that list,

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.410 align:middle line:84%
as well, because it's
very, very important.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
do you regress

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
the brother, the sister, the
mother, the father, in a group

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:84%
or separately, when
you realize there's

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
ancestral issue here?

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Usually I'm always
going at it from a past life

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:90%
perspective first.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So individual?

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.718 align:middle line:84%
They've come in,
they've got an issue.

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to take
them into the past life.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.995 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is, if intuitively I'm

00:21:45.995 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:84%
going-- we're just
not there yet.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:90%
We have not found the issue.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Then that's when I
will have them start

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:90%
going down the ancestral line.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when, yes,
you find, oh, whoops, it

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:90%
wasn't their past lives.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
There's something that happened
to their ancestors that

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:84%
needs healing, and
attention, and compassion,

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and grace, sent to that
incident can really

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.228 align:middle line:84%
make a huge impact in
our daily lives now.

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have a caller.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Her name is Louise,
out of Kentucky,

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:17.120 align:middle line:84%
on my "Coast to Coast"
show who claims that she

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:90%
is the reincarnated Cleopatra.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Now this person is
a delightful person

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and seems to know
everything about Cleopatra.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:90%
She even described Mark Anthony.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
How do we know she's
not delusional--

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:39.640 align:middle line:84%
sorry, Louise, or she really
is the reincarnated Cleopatra?

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.572 align:middle line:90%
How do we know?

00:22:40.572 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: You know,
what's so interesting,

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know whether
Louise is Cleopatra or not,

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
but my very first
book on regression,

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
"Lifestream," which came out in
2002, I talked about the fact

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
that I had regressed five
Cleopatras just in Dallas,

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Texas alone.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
believe all of them?

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I'm not--
well, I have to say no.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I did not.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: OK.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:84%
That said, I'm not
exactly judging like,

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:84%
are they tapping into an
archetype, these traits

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.030 align:middle line:84%
of Cleopatra, or
were they Cleopatra,

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.280 align:middle line:84%
or is this the
collective consciousness?

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.070 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line for me
is, if they can go back

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:84%
into that event, they're
seeing Mark Antony,

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're having this whole
thing happen, that's wonderful.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Why is that applying to
what we're doing now?

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And if they can explain all
that and it's making their

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
now better, than for me, that is
the most important part of it,

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
because it is a therapy
at the end of the day.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, if she claims to
be this reincarnated Cleopatra

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
without regression, so
how in the world would

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.650 align:middle line:84%
she even think
that or know that?

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:90%
How would that happen?

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I've got
some other research

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
into spontaneous
past life memories.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, Plato talked
about something called

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.390 align:middle line:84%
anamnesis, which is the
fact that the soul actually

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:90%
knows who it was.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.865 align:middle line:90%
We know it--

00:23:55.865 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who knows
who all of them.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need a
regression for that.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's certainly possible.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Like I can tell you, I know that
I lived a past life in England.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to go
on a regression.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:84%
When I go there, I just have a
sense I've been there before.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:10.796 align:middle line:90%
Maybe things are familiar.

00:24:10.796 --> 00:24:12.296 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You feel
comfortable there?

00:24:12.296 --> 00:24:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And so likewise, maybe she
just feels she was Cleopatra.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.003 align:middle line:84%
And really, you can't
exactly argue with people--

00:24:20.003 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, because--

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.837 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: --about that.

00:24:21.837 --> 00:24:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you can't
change their mind.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: No.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's not--

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
can't put them down.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.672 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: No, it doesn't really.

00:24:27.672 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:84%
As long as they're
happy with it,

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and they're using it to empower
themselves and make themselves

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.700 align:middle line:84%
a better human being,
then I'm all for it.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's
funny because you'll

00:24:35.283 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:84%
ask her questions about ancient
Egypt, and she has the answers.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It's weird.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Well, I would
say she surely did have

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:90%
a past life in ancient Egypt.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Was it as Cleopatra?

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not to
say-- there's got

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
to be somebody out there who's
Cleopatra, so maybe it's her.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us some
of your case studies

00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that you have in your books that
really just boggle your mind.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: One of the interesting
ones from the new book,

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.090 align:middle line:90%
there's a--

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.798 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the name
of the new book is?

00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: This one's called "Heal
Your Ancestors to Heal Your

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:90%
Life."

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: So in this
one, there-- you

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:84%
know how you could be doing
something your whole life.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.052 align:middle line:90%
You know you're good at it.

00:25:16.052 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, you're
probably going to question,

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:84%
should I really be
doing this or not?

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:90%
So a woman came to see me.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
She was having migraines because
we can, of course, address

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:90%
physical challenges--

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: --using these--

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --that happens.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: --methods.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And she also had been
working as an ER nurse.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Lots of stress,
lots of pressure.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And she happened to mention
that her mother was a nurse,

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
her grandmother was a nurse,
this is just what they did.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:84%
But she was also to
the point in her life

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.077 align:middle line:84%
where she was kind of going,
you know, I'm just wondering,

00:25:44.077 --> 00:25:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is this really what I'm
supposed to be doing?

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we went on the
typical past life regression,

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:84%
but there was still
something I felt needed

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:84%
to be uncovered about the family
line and this nurse connection.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So, she zapped back into
a previous situation

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.597 align:middle line:90%
that happened to her.

00:26:02.597 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
One of her great, great,
great grandmothers,

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.640 align:middle line:84%
she went to the Civil
War and saw this scene

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
where her several
times great grandmother

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.060 align:middle line:84%
was in the middle
of a battlefield.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: You know,
cannons, blasting--

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.242 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
remote viewing, right?

00:26:16.242 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Yes, remote
viewing the ancestor,

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what this is.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: So she went there,
she saw her grandmother just

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:90%
selflessly tending to people.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was so emotional,
it brought her to tears.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And she saw that it was a lot
of the trauma from that war

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:84%
was kind of-- it gets
energetically stuck in people's

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
energy fields and it was
brought forth through the DNA,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:90%
through all the lineage.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
amazing regression.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Yes, it
was interesting.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the physical
healing is one thing.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But the more powerful thing,
which was kind of a surprise,

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
was that she came back,
she was so emotional.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:90%
She goes, oh, my God.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I will never
question this again.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.117 align:middle line:84%
This is where I'm
supposed to be.

00:27:01.117 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm supposed to do.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:90%
This is just what we do.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And she was so selfless, how
could I even be complaining

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:90%
about my life anymore?

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And so she was able to walk
away with just great certainty

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:11.940 align:middle line:90%
about her purpose.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of the
reasons why people suffer,

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.790 align:middle line:90%
it's more of an emotional thing.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Like, what am I doing here?

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And so she didn't
have that anymore

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:90%
and she was strengthened by it.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
regress someone,

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.710 align:middle line:84%
are they hypnotized
or just relaxed?

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: They are hypnotized,
but I think that--

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.503 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean
they're in a coma.

00:27:33.503 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
They're going to remember
what they're saying.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:84%
We're taking the very quick
beta brainwaves, putting them

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:90%
into alpha.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So in that state, you
are still conscious.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:84%
So your conscious mind is
still going, OK, I'm here.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of everything
that's going on.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.905 align:middle line:90%
But yet, you're relaxed.

00:27:49.905 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And so pictures,
thoughts, and feelings

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.870 align:middle line:84%
begin then to bubble
up into the mind.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is,
these are images

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.042 align:middle line:90%
that are coming from somewhere.

00:27:58.042 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:90%
You're saying, wait a minute.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.770 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't make this stuff up.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Where is this coming from?

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:84%
This is a Hollywood
script, right?

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.017 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: That's right.

00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And in the state, though,
because they're still aware--

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
I need them to be
aware, I don't want them

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:84%
in delta meditation
state because I'm

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:90%
going to ask, well, OK, great.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
remember anything

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:90%
when you kind of bring them out?

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: They do.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I want them to, so that
they can get the lesson.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Because that's
what you have to have,

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
is what is the lesson
that you learn and--

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they in shock?

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: --how are
you doing this?

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
They come back and they just
go, whoa, that was interesting.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this tell
you about the entire universe

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that we're going through,
when you have reincarnation,

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:41.680 align:middle line:84%
where you have life after
death, what's it all mean,

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: In my opinion, there
is no such thing as time

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and that these things are
just sitting out there

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously to be accessed.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.290 align:middle line:84%
We talk about a quote,
"past life regression."

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe there is such
a thing as past, present,

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.680 align:middle line:90%
or future.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.270 align:middle line:84%
These things are
happening simultaneously,

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and we can just reach out
into the unified field

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.620 align:middle line:84%
if we know which doorways to
open, access that information,

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and then bring it into the
now through an empowering

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.590 align:middle line:84%
way to make ourselves feel
more peaceful in our present

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:12.430 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you like
what you do, Shelley?

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: I love it.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell the world how.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: I do.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely have loved
this since I was a kid.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I am so thankful that I've had a
chance to do this for a living.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:90%
I can't even believe it.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the soul is?

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I'm starting
to really question

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.730 align:middle line:84%
this idea of where we go when
we die, and what is all of this?

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we are some
vast interconnected

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:84%
network of consciousness,
and that this physical shell

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.520 align:middle line:84%
that we're in is some
kind of an illusion.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:84%
We're really connected
to all things

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.620 align:middle line:84%
throughout all time
in the universe,

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and we've kind of,
somehow, stuffed ourselves

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:84%
into this physical
shell to come here

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.590 align:middle line:84%
to have a very
unique experience.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
But I believe we're always
connected to all things

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.190 align:middle line:90%
throughout time.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look
at a little child,

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and you say to yourself,
that person had a past life,

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and a past life, it's
kind of strange, isn't it?

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: It is.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I see
little kids, and I'm

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.828 align:middle line:84%
sure this has
happened to you, you

00:30:13.828 --> 00:30:15.620 align:middle line:84%
see a little child
walking by, and you just

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:90%
make eye contact with them.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.100 align:middle line:90%
And there's just this, ah!

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.682 align:middle line:84%
This feeling of, oh, whoa,
I'm getting the chills

00:30:21.682 --> 00:30:22.640 align:middle line:90%
even thinking about it.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I knew that
person in another life or--

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:25.563 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --whatever.

00:30:25.563 --> 00:30:27.585 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: And it's
just like that.

00:30:27.585 --> 00:30:28.460 align:middle line:90%
It's really profound.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
could have been

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
your mother in another
life, or your father.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Or your brother.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:90%
But there was a connection.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: There's a connection.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
families reincarnate together

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.840 align:middle line:90%
constantly?

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Maybe not constantly,
but yes, I think they do.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.825 align:middle line:84%
Over time, I think they come
together for different reasons.

00:30:49.825 --> 00:30:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've
been doing this--

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:90%
and how many years now, Shelley?

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Over 20 years.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.967 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 20 years.

00:30:55.967 --> 00:30:57.300 align:middle line:90%
And you're glad you're doing it.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: I am.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you
go next with this?

00:31:00.375 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:90%
What's your next evolution?

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I've got some
new books forthcoming.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.300 align:middle line:84%
One is going to be called
"Blast from the Past"

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.670 align:middle line:84%
where I take some
research that I published

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago about these
spontaneous past life memories,

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and I'm breaking it down into
really a lot of the areas

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that my career has spanned,
including-- you know,

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.130 align:middle line:84%
you could pick up a gem and
you could have a past life

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:24.420 align:middle line:84%
regression, because
those stones are

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.950 align:middle line:84%
coming from different
parts of the world.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.385 align:middle line:84%
You can look into
somebody's eyes,

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:84%
like you just described
with the child,

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.350 align:middle line:90%
and go, bam, that was my mother.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.750 align:middle line:10%
You can travel and
you can be bombarded

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.570 align:middle line:10%
with these spontaneous
past life memories.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's something.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I've just completed
another book on the Akashic

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.175 align:middle line:84%
records where I'm describing
the inter-dimensional--

00:31:44.175 --> 00:31:44.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We all have--

00:31:44.715 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: --doorway--

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.278 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --those
records, don't we?

00:31:46.278 --> 00:31:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.307 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what it's
called "the good book?"

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: Yes, the "Book
of Life," "the good book."

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.605 align:middle line:10%
Shelley, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:31:54.605 --> 00:31:55.980 align:middle line:10%
>>KAEHR: George,
it's been a joy.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Thank you.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe one day,
we'll have you regress me.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.745 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEHR: I would
love to do that.

00:32:00.745 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:90%
That would be a dream.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe
I was beyond Egypt.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Who knows where I was, right?

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGINA CANNON: There you go.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.887 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you were beyond beyond.

00:32:06.887 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we do go to
other planets too, right?

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.232 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Oh, yes.

00:32:10.232 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is fascinating.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KAEHR: Yes.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:15.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Past lives,
they affect who we are

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:10%
and what we are in this life,
so maybe it's a good idea

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:10%
to find out who you were then.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
