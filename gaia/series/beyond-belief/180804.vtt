00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with a
very special favorite guest

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:10%
of mine, Brooks Agnew.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
He is an honor
graduate in chemistry

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
from the Tennessee
Technological University,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:90%
a multi-patented engineer.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.230 align:middle line:90%
He runs a company.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.742 align:middle line:84%
It's an electric truck
company out of North Carolina.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Brooks, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BROOKS AGNEW: Thank
you so much, George.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Way too
busy, that's for sure.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Busy's good
these days, isn't it?

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Busy's good.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You and I got
together back 13, 14 years ago,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
talking about your quest to
go into the Hollow Earth.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
You were going to be in a
Russian ice-breaking machine,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:90%
boat or something like that.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happened to
that and your quest

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:90%
for the Hollow Earth?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: Well, we traveled
the world, of course,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:10%
and gathered information from
all the ancient cultures.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:10%
We went to Tibet and
China and Japan, Mexico.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:10%
And the last thing on the list
was this trip to the Arctic

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:10%
to explore this
legend that there

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.067 align:middle line:10%
might be an opening into
what might be a Hollow Earth.

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
curvature hole, right?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, that
shouldn't be too hard.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:84%
We should be able to
find pictures of that.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:90%
There were no pictures.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So I joined an expedition
in, I think it was 2006,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and it was run by a man
named Stephen Curry.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:90%
And we were all set to go.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.871 align:middle line:84%
We were selling
seats on the boat

00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get it
filled up with enough money

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to go, and suddenly,
really suddenly, he

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.350 align:middle line:90%
developed brain cancer and died.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So there we were, early
2007 with no leader.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So the board came
to me and said,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:90%
well, you run big projects.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.794 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you take over
as expedition leader?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
that's exciting.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Let me think about it.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.075 align:middle line:84%
A couple of months later,
I said, OK, I'll do it.

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you doing
your other businesses

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: I was.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's not easy.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: No, it isn't.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But we set our sights
on the summer of 2008

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:90%
to try to do this.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the economy had
other things in mind in 2008.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So and the reason
we set our sights

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that way is because there was
a very strange weather anomaly

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.240 align:middle line:90%
that occurred that winter.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was the
Northwest Passage actually

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:90%
opened up for the first time.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was it
was a strangely warm winter.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:84%
The wind blew straight across
the ice for months and months

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and just that stress and
that warmness, it broke open.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, well, we'll
just sail up there and go see

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:90%
if there's an opening or not.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And there were
some strange things

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that happened around the planet
at that same time related

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.580 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
In Malaysia, every few
years, they go down

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and sample rays, like
stingrays and manta rays,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
because evidently,
this species responds

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
to stress in the
environment by mutating.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And normally, they see 20,
25 new species of rays,

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:90%
but that year, they found 1,500.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
were not mutations.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They were extinct versions,
fully alive, swimming around.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.875 align:middle line:84%
Frilled sharks, dorsaled squids,
things that we haven't seen.

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thousands of them.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Oh, yeah.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:84%
But they had been gone
for millions of years.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:90%
So we thought--

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
under the ice.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Maybe they
were inside the Earth,

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and the ice gave them an opening
to swim through into our sea,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and they ended up in Malaysia.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, there's got
to be some other evidence,

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:90%
other sciences.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:90%
So we explored seismology.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Turns out, there
was a study done

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Wysession at Washington
University in St. Louis,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and they went through
600,000 seismograms,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
which are these printouts.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
After they have
a big earthquake,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
all the seismometers around the
Earth pick up the vibrations

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:90%
and then make a printout.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But it never really
was thoroughly

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:90%
analyzed as a system.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So they analyzed
it as the system,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and underneath the crust
of the Atlantic Ocean,

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.990 align:middle line:90%
they found another ocean.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:90%
That made news too.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:90%
That was a big story.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, but it
was there and gone.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It was like no further
studies were done.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So we said, well, let's
rent the icebreaker.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
It carries about 100, 105
scientists and filmmakers

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and record keepers,
and we'll just go see.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And it just became too large
of a financial endeavor to do.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's the last
remaining piece.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But since then, we have
gained a lot of interest

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
from Australia and New Zealand,
Europe, Japan, of course.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And now some major efforts to
put it on the small screen,

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.495 align:middle line:90%
as a 13-piece mini series.

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you could recoup
your money back that way.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, it
could be, sure.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Because you could do
pay-per-view or sell

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:90%
advertising or whatever.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.006 align:middle line:84%
It's only like $3 and a 1/2
million to do the expedition.

00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, then there's
post-production work,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.542 align:middle line:90%
but it could be done.

00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
still believe there

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:90%
is a Hollow Earth out there?

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well,
"belief's" a word I

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:84%
don't really use
much as a scientist.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.030 align:middle line:90%
I believe in data.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:84%
So I can tell you that
the old idea that we

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
live on this molten ball
floating through space

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
has now been thoroughly
debunked in the sense

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
that we have enough data to call
into question that whole idea

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:90%
of how planets are made.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
We've also seen other planets
in our own solar system

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that are either
made of two planets

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.882 align:middle line:90%
or are hollow themselves.

00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an
interesting clip on YouTube

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.437 align:middle line:90%
about the Hollow Earth.

00:06:07.437 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Hollow
Earth theory states

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:10%
that the Earth is a hollow
planet with ancient entrances

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:10%
to the subterranean worlds
scattered throughout it,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:10%
including near both polar caps.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
This theory has been
reported since ancient times,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and scientists such
as Edmond Halley

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
have defended it
throughout history.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:10%
From 1818 to 1826, the American
John C. Symmes passionately

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:10%
supported the theory as well.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:10%
According to him, there
was a subterranean world

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:10%
inside our planet
illuminated by a tiny sun

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:10%
and that included mountains,
forests, and lakes.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Symmes launched a
national campaign

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
aiming to raise the necessary
funds to send an expedition

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to the Arctic to
search for an entrance

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:90%
to the subterranean world.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
He even sent a proposal to
the United States Congress

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of
getting government assistance

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
to find the entrance
to the inner world.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately for him, he
died before the government did

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:10%
allocate funding
for his purpose,

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:10%
and the expedition
departed in 1838,

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:10%
although, in truth, its
goals were not so altruistic.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.320 align:middle line:84%
In reality, it was part of the
ploys world powers were trying

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
to learn the importance of the
only land not yet conquered

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:90%
in the world, both polar caps.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Regardless, commanded
by Charles Wilkes,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
the expedition
lasted four years.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
It served to discover the
vast geographical extent

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of the Arctic but no sign
of a passage into the Earth

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:90%
was found.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great story.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: That's a great story.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If it's there.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: One of my
ancestors, Sir James Ross,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
discovered the north
magnetic pole in 1831.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And it took him two tries.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
The first time, his ship
was crushed in the ice.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
They wintered on the ice, and in
the spring, they were rescued.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.720 align:middle line:10%
And the fool tried it again, and
then he discovered it in 1831.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So it was quite a fever
in the early 1800s.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:90%
And it has been--

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:90%
it's been pursued several times.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But the reason
they fall short is

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.910 align:middle line:84%
because they can't seem to
gain access to this area that's

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:90%
kind of locked in by ice.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not flown over very
often, and if it is,

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
it's flown over very high,
and it has cloud cover over it

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle line:10%
But the Russians have these
nuclear-powered icebreakers.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:10%
They're made, they're
ice-rated to go

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.493 align:middle line:10%
through this two
and three-meter ice,

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:34.659 align:middle line:10%
and they're really the only
ships on the planet that

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:10%
could do this.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're excited
about doing it.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, with all
the satellites we've got

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.825 align:middle line:84%
and the shuttle
missions that we've had

00:08:40.825 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and everything we're
doing, don't you

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:84%
think an astronaut
or something would

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
be taking a picture
of what could

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
be a hole in the
center of the planet?

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, it's
difficult to see

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.410 align:middle line:84%
with the naked eye or cameras
through the cloud cover, which

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:90%
would always be there.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
But other forms, like
infrared or X-ray

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
or other forms of wavelengths
could see through it.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
But in 2006, the
NOAA and EUMETSAT

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:84%
passed an international
rule, a law,

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:90%
called the Data Denial Act.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And what this does
is it makes it

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
illegal to post or to
share any real-time imaging

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
data above the 60th
parallel during times

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.055 align:middle line:90%
of conflict or war.

00:09:28.055 --> 00:09:28.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:30.938 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, they're
afraid that that data could

00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
be fed into the targeting
systems of cruise missiles

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and be used for visual
data for navigation.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So they don't release
that information.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Above the 60th
parallel, everything

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:84%
we see on the
internet is animated.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
that hole looks like, Brooks?

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you obviously
believe it's there.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.989 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using that
word "believe" again.

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: If there
is a hole, if there

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:84%
is an opening between the
crust that will blend the two

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
seas together, you
have to remember,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
these oceans are about
4,000 meters deep.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.901 align:middle line:84%
So it could be in the
crust but underwater.

00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now, that's
an interesting point.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, wouldn't the
water sift into it

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:90%
like a funnel or a drain?

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.655 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It would.

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
If the opening was
large enough, maybe you

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.086 align:middle line:84%
would see like a drain opening
where you have a whirlpool.

00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, or the
water just shooting in.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And that
was the whole idea

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.190 align:middle line:84%
behind building the
gyroscopes to measure

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:84%
the curvature of the Earth
while the ship was moving.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So that we could measure if
the ship over-rotates and moves

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.100 align:middle line:84%
into this opening,
and it's not just

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:84%
measuring the normal
curvature of the Earth.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a phenomenon
that has been recorded

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.854 align:middle line:84%
in Maritime records, where a
ship will disappear for a day

00:10:50.854 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:84%
because the ships
used to sail in pairs.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just went
right into the curvature.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.953 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, it
would go into what's

00:10:55.953 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:84%
called the oceanic depression
where sea level isn't quite sea

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, like a drain,
eventually, the water is gone.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Where would the ocean be?

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Why doesn't it
get all sucked up?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, this is where
you have to kind of get

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:90%
into planetary cosmology.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
What does gravity do if
gravity is based on mass?

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
If the Earth is made of
actually two structures,

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:84%
one is maybe a
900-mile thick crust

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and the other is a
solid core but they're

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
separate from one
another, although

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:90%
rotating on the same axis.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a
space in between.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But the crust would
have its own gravity,

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.437 align:middle line:84%
and the core would
have its own gravity.

00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the water
would actually adhere

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:90%
to the inside of the crust.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you were sailing,
you might not even

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
notice that you're
sailing into the Earth.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
You'd just keep
sailing on the ocean

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
until you're on the
inside of the planet.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Admiral Byrd claims
that he went through the North

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Pole, and that he went into some
kind of center of the planet

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:04.810 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The funny thing
about the early 1900s,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
competition to set world

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:90%
records, especially by air.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So when Admiral Byrd took
his ship apart and put it

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:84%
on the "Chantilly" and
sailed the "Spitz Bergen,"

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:84%
he just happened to hit
the window perfectly

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:84%
for getting his plane off
the boat and onto the shore.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Literally an hour
later, it could have

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.320 align:middle line:90%
destroyed the whole mission.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
But those brave souls
rebuilt that plane on shore,

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:84%
took off, loaded with
gasoline, from that surface,

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:90%
which was not an airport.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.934 align:middle line:90%
It was just a flat beach.

00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was just
lucky to have that beach.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.959 align:middle line:84%
Well, they flew a course
which he set by sextant.

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if you've
ever used a sextant or not.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, no.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been in the Navy, but I've
never had to use one of those.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, it's hard enough
to use from a boat, let alone

00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:90%
an airplane.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But evidently, he was a
real expert at using it.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You tie it
into the stars, right?

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: And the sun.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the sun.

00:13:06.015 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And he claimed that he
flew the 2,500-mile route over

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
the North Pole and back,
but he arrived back early.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So it had been done a
couple times after that

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:90%
by other people.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They took longer,
and they didn't

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:90%
see what Admiral Byrd reported.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of, as I
said competition and debunking

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:90%
of one story and the other.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult to know who
was really telling the truth.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
But Byrd did a lot of
television appearances

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
on national television
in those days

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and told the story over and
over again, always pretty much

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:90%
the same.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So I have a tendency
to believe he

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.140 align:middle line:90%
was an aviation hero, for sure.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.809 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the story
is kind of wild isn't it?

00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: There are a
couple versions of it.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
One is his official
version, where he actually

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:90%
flew over lush green areas.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Saw animals, like
dinosaurs or something?

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, his
original version,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.730 align:middle line:84%
he just saw green
areas and there

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't have been any
and liquid water and things

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.750 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.416 align:middle line:84%
And then he turned
around and came back.

00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But over the years, others
that told the story kind of

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:84%
embellished it, woolly
mammoths and dinosaurs.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: UFOs

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Then inside
the Earth, right.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.470 align:middle line:90%
It kind of got really crazy.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a
diary that circulated.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of,
as a scientist,

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I have to separate
the things that really

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
have factual information
from and then

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:90%
unsubstantiated testimony.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So I can't really refute
it because I can't, but I

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.365 align:middle line:84%
can't really support it either
until we try it for ourselves.

00:14:42.365 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Pat Boone
is a friend of ours,

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:10%
and I always talk with
him about his movie,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:10%
the original "Journey to the
Center of the Earth," which

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:10%
was amazing.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:10%
But what I found
fascinating, and what

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:10%
we heard on that YouTube
clip was the possibility

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:10%
of a smaller sun
within the planet.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, it's
always been a question.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I guess it started
a few years back

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
when an image was taken of the
Earth from far out into space.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And it showed auroras over
both poles at the same time.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:90%
This was not expected.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Normally, we thought the
solar wind is what causes it.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And so one side of the
planet or the other,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
season gets the aurora.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this wasn't
the Northern Lights, was it?

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It was but
it was over both poles

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, which
threw everyone into a tizzy.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't do it.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.295 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Not if it comes
from the solar wind.

00:15:36.295 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
It had to come from
another source.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So JPL quickly
built an experiment

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:84%
called the Themis probe, which
was a nose cone with five

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:90%
satellites in it.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:90%
They launched it into space.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.517 align:middle line:84%
It assumed five
different levels of orbit

00:15:48.517 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:84%
so that all the satellites
were going around

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:90%
at different times.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally
they would line up,

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
they would turn the system
on, and take measurements.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the orbits, they
measured a cosmic explosion

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:84%
between satellites
three and four.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And so the explosion went out at
360 degrees in every direction.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
It passed satellite four
and five, went out to space.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Three, two, and one struck the
atmosphere, boom, the aurora

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:90%
formed.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:90%
So they said, well, that's it.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The auroras are formed
by cosmic bullets,

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
end of the report.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They should
have kept going.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, I know.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So now, we've launched
several other probes

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:84%
because we're
trying to understand

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:84%
does this come from
the sun or does

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:90%
it come from inside the planet?

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Do we have this
magnetic electrojet

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that's coming out of
Earth at the poles

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.402 align:middle line:84%
that are causing these ions
in our atmosphere to light up?

00:16:45.402 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a great
story if that's the case.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Just, I think it
was this morning, the Parker

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:90%
probe headed for the sun.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.462 align:middle line:84%
Again, to take close-up
measurements of the sun

00:16:56.462 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before it
burns up, right?

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.586 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, well,
they went at night.

00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:90%
So it'll be OK.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Bottom line is, we don't know.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And what we're really
doing is the right thing.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:90%
We're asking questions.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
And when we ask questions,
we develop experiments

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:90%
to answer those questions.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're spending the money
to conduct those experiments.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's interesting
what we're going to find out.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you mean
by the union of polarity?

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.200 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: When we studied the 44
ancient cultures to write "The

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.027 align:middle line:84%
Ark of Millions
of Years" series,

00:17:32.027 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:90%
which was our first four books--

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great series.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.755 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It was my first
interview on your program,

00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:90%
in fact.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.990 align:middle line:84%
What we discovered
was these cultures

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
had a tradition that goes
back even further than them

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that Earth is made of
really two planets,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:90%
two different kinds of energy.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
One planet is an older,
kind of temporal energy.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:84%
The other is a more spiritual,
newer kind of energy.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth is both 4
and 1/2 billion years old

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and 6,000 years old put
together at the same time.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that's where we get
that different feeling between

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:84%
the religious, who believe,
it's a 6,000-year-old planet

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:90%
and then the 4.5 billion.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
talk to each other.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: But the
truth is that they

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:90%
do go along with each other.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:90%
They are symbiotic.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:90%
There's kind of like us.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
We are this physical thing of
protein and calcium and water,

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and then we're also the
animated being on the inside

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:90%
that gives us our energy.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
When we die, the body stays
behind, and the spirit goes on.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Earth, they
believed, was the same way.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So we carried that forward
and gave it a name,

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.900 align:middle line:84%
which is the union
of the polarity.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
especially cosmologists

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
will say, what a crazy thing,
a planet made of two planets.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But just this year, we
finally get the data back

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and got it analyzed
of the planet Uranus.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.834 align:middle line:84%
It is actually made
of two planets.

00:19:04.834 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is incredible.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It has another
planet on the inside of it

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:90%
that collided with it.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You recently
published "The Birth Trilogy."

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take a look at a
trailer from the first volume.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Bearth-- two
Earths, one race for time

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is true with the use
of fictional characters

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:84%
to help tell the epic
story of the ancient union

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:90%
of the polarity.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
In a white-knuckle
ride, the reader

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:84%
is chased from beginning
to end of the creation

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:90%
and destiny of the Earth.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Enormous financial empires
strategically move billions

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:84%
of dollars to take advantage
of their foreknowledge

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:90%
of the events that are coming.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The events and
espionage are real.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
The names of these billionaires
and world events are real.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Nothing has been changed
to protect anyone

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:90%
because they are all guilty.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
As explained by Dr. Brooks
Agnew on "Coast to Coast AM"

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.530 align:middle line:84%
with George Noory, History
Channel, and National

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Geographic Channel,
planet Earth is

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:84%
made of two planets,
one very high frequency

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and one low frequency,
occupying the same space.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Merged during the
flood of Noah, they

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
have been rotating in harmony
for nearly 6,000 years

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:90%
until now.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Crafted as a trilogy of
major motion pictures,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:84%
this is the epic story
of conflict and conquest

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
between five races
of beings mentioned

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:90%
in the book of Genesis.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The one-party
presidential system

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.250 align:middle line:84%
breaks down, allowing a write-in
candidate, Robert Riker,

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.870 align:middle line:90%
to be elected.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Ancient powers controlling the
economics and military activity

of Earth are thwarted by
the will of the people.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.280 align:middle line:10%
Here and there, pockets of
light are woven together

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:10%
as the ultimate conflict
between the seed of Lucifer

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:10%
and the seed of Adam square
off for the grand battle

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:10%
for inheritance of the Earth.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:84%
History unfolds exactly
as this book tells it.

The battle between good
and evil happens every day

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:90%
on the television news.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And by reading this
book, you will know why.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You will also know
why it is vital

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that you do something about it,
starting with reading this book

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and then getting
others to read it.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:90%
We don't have much time.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.744 align:middle line:90%
The race is on.

00:21:28.744 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's a
novel, but it's based

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of fact, isn't it?

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Sure, it's kind
of a new style of genre.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:84%
We call it faction, where we
take true history, true events,

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and then we inject fictional
characters into those events

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:90%
to carry the reader through.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.574 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So are you
happy with the results?

00:21:45.574 --> 00:21:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, I'm
pretty happy with it.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
People, the readers are
calling it the Bearth journey

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
now because it kind of
takes you from this street

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:90%
race in Pasadena.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And then this group of
misfits kind of comes together

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and understands
these great forces

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:90%
that are at work on the Earth.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the Rapture
and the seed of mankind

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
told from a science
fiction point of view.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.194 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might this be
based on a movie soon?

00:22:14.194 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We're actually working
on a screenplay right now.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.594 align:middle line:84%
It's 42 episodes, so it's
going to be spread over three

00:22:19.594 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:90%
seasons on the small screen.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.551 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's amazing
how that's working.

00:22:22.551 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty
exciting about that.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.270 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: I would say that
the anthropology of mankind

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:10%
is changing.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:10%
In the last 20 years,
we're connected

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.930 align:middle line:10%
in a totally different
way than we've ever

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:10%
been connected before.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
We're able to meet people we
would never have met before.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.265 align:middle line:84%
We're able to share
ideas in an instant.

00:22:40.265 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And where the idea is
that world changes really

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:84%
begin with one
person or two people,

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
that has taken centuries to come
to fruition but not anymore.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, a change can happen
in a matter of hours

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:84%
if the right thought
and the right person

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.675 align:middle line:90%
can get his word out.

00:23:00.675 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about this possibility

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth might have been
the result of two planets.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, it's
not uncommon in space.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We do see binary
planets together.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned that.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And collisions.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And then's there's sun
in the one video we watched.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:84%
We look out in space,
we see snapshots.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.647 align:middle line:84%
We obviously are not
an old enough race.

00:23:23.647 --> 00:23:25.479 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been looking
at space long enough

00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to really know how
planets are made,

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
but we can sort
of see the stages.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We see the giant
accretion disks.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
We see protoplanets
being formed.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:84%
We see three different
kinds of classes

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:90%
of planets being formed.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.560 align:middle line:84%
As this mass comes
together, it begins

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
to spin faster and
faster and faster,

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:84%
like an ice skater
pulling her arms in.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So one of three things happens,
what we witness in space.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Either it gets so
much energy and gets

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.370 align:middle line:84%
so tight that it becomes
unstable and it explodes.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
The other is that
it becomes lopsided,

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and it spins a piece of
itself off and forms a moon.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.740 align:middle line:84%
We have an example of that
in our own solar system--

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Venus and Mercury.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the planets
just expand and cool, expand

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:90%
and cool, expand and cool.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And as that happens, the
crust begins to slow down.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It begins to become
cool enough to where

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:90%
liquid water can exist.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, what happens,
it leaves the core behind.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So the core is still spinning
at its original speed,

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.557 align:middle line:84%
and the crust is
expanding away from it.

00:24:33.557 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what
has happened to Earth?

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It appears
so because now we

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
have two independent
scientific sources that

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:84%
have measured the core
spectragraphically,

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and they've said that it's
actually a solid iron crystal.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:53.214 align:middle line:84%
So if that's true, it has to
be somewhere between 5,500

00:24:53.214 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:90%
and 6,000 degrees.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.400 align:middle line:84%
That is, in fact, what
they have measured.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will it ever cool?

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Well, yes.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Ever, what is ever?

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.840 align:middle line:84%
It could be millions, billions
of years it will cool.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But at that temperature,
if it's iron,

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:90%
it's putting off a white light.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And that white light is
suitable for photosynthesis.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Now it's not
fusion, like our sun

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
with all the short wavelengths,
but the wavelengths

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
of light that are
being put off are

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
suitable for
photosynthesis, which

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.464 align:middle line:84%
means plant life could exist
on the inside of the planet.

00:25:26.464 --> 00:25:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
other countries

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:84%
involved in looking for
this possible Hollow Earth?

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes, there are.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
We, of course, ran
our pilot film in 2007

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:84%
in the Genes of Galileo contest
in Japan on Nippon Television

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Network.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea, but
we won that contest.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
17 million Japanese watched
that film in one night.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It was amazing.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So that created a
kind of fan club.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.563 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are still
following you today, right?

00:26:00.563 --> 00:26:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes, they are.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And we also have Australia
and New Zealand--

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
there are strong groups
of explorers there

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:84%
that have now shown
renewed interest

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and that may be where most
of the financial leadership

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.550 align:middle line:84%
is coming from for putting
the rest of this together.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
organizations or groups

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:90%
like the so-called deep state?

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Are they interested in
something like this?

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, funny you
should bring that up.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:30.160 align:middle line:84%
The deep state is almost
indefinable to most people.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Inside, our
government has formed

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.470 align:middle line:84%
a group of agencies,
departments, bureaus,

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:90%
administrations.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On their own, I think.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yes, kind
of self-sustaining.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:84%
They began during
Roosevelt's day.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a corporate
style of government.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
They needed to get big
things done in a rapid form.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So you couldn't really go to
the people and go to Congress.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And it would just get
mired down in debate.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So they just formed this
corporate way of doing things,

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:90%
and it became its own entity.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Other presidents, like
Eisenhower and Kennedy,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.421 align:middle line:84%
tried to warn us about
this, but there really

00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
wasn't much we could do.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting that
we get a president who

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:90%
comes from outside the system.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:90%
He's not a politician.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:90%
He's not groomed that way.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't like that.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.285 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: No, they
don't really like it.

00:27:21.285 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:84%
But now he's formed
this new space force.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or he's going to.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Well, yes.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And what are we hearing from
the Air Force and from NASA,

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
is oh, we don't
need a space force.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
This has always been
done by the Air Force.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:90%
We know what we're doing.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:84%
This is just
duplication of effort.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But really, I think it is that
the original deep state doesn't

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.380 align:middle line:90%
want us to know these things.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't want us to
find out these things.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So this new division,
as you'll recall,

00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:00.790 align:middle line:84%
we lost hundreds of flag
officers, not just from the Air

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Force but also the
Marines and the Navy.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And these were
experienced people.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:84%
These were the
smartest of the smart,

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:84%
but they wouldn't
follow the orders,

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and so now they were
pushed to the outside.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of them wouldn't
stay on the outside,

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.010 align:middle line:90%
like General Flynn.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And so now they're
being punished

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:90%
for doing that, coming back in.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think this
new space force is

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.180 align:middle line:84%
going to allow some of
this experience, some

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.020 align:middle line:84%
of this leadership to
come back into a system

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:90%
outside the deep state.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:90%
It should be very interesting.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Attorney
Daniel Sheehan has

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.952 align:middle line:84%
talked on "Open Minds," a Gaia
program, about the deep state.

00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Why
do you say the source is

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.127 align:middle line:10%
the national security state?

00:28:44.127 --> 00:28:44.960 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.585 align:middle line:10%
>>DANIEL SHEEHAN:
Because what happened

00:28:46.585 --> 00:28:48.820 align:middle line:10%
is that at the end
of World War II,

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:10%
the United States, for
the first time in history,

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:10%
passed a National Security Act,
where they created a Central

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.720 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence Agency that
was explicitly authorized

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:10%
to go around the world,
disrupting other people's

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:10%
elections to disrupt other
people's democratic choices

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:10%
that they wanted to make,
whatever economic system

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:10%
they wanted, whatever
political system they wanted.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
They said we're not
going to allow that.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that what happened
is they developed

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:84%
a whole covert operations
directorate inside the CIA,

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and they developed this talent
they called a public diplomacy

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.010 align:middle line:90%
capacity.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.219 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Sounds innocuous.

00:29:27.219 --> 00:29:28.384 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: It does, it does.

00:29:28.384 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:90%
It's one of those euphemisms.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.203 align:middle line:84%
What they would do
is they would go in

00:29:31.203 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and they would
infiltrate the news

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:90%
stations in other countries.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
They would infiltrate
the newspapers.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.920 align:middle line:84%
They would feed
them, force feed them

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:90%
information that was false.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that what happened

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:46.600 align:middle line:84%
is when the policies of that
Central Intelligence Agency

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:84%
started to be challenged, when
people started getting upset

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
about what they were
doing around the world,

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
they turned all of those
skills onto the public

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.714 align:middle line:90%
here in the United States.

00:29:55.714 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
the deep state

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.050 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
the Hollow Earth,

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:90%
for example, if anything?

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, one of the
things that humans are good at

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:84%
is exploring,
discovering things.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:90%
We explore space.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:09.070 align:middle line:90%
We explore the oceans.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:90%
We explore ourselves.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're
the best for that.

00:30:11.615 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That's what
we're built to do.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.520 align:middle line:90%
It's just we're a curious race.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes when
you're discovering

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:23.590 align:middle line:84%
things that take away from the
power of a government or a--

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I won't even call it a
government-- a group,

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.860 align:middle line:84%
a cabal, a syndicate that
wants to control the world,

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:90%
then that thought is suppressed.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Especially if it--
and I have to tell you

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.390 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of
the Hollow Earth

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.270 align:middle line:90%
excites a passion in people.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it does.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the unknown
that really gets us.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, it's
more than that.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, lots of
things are unknown,

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:84%
but there's a symbiosis between
the human being and the planet.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.760 align:middle line:84%
It's natural, and it's
almost inexplicable.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But when we start talking
about the possibility of Earth

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.670 align:middle line:84%
being hollow, people get
very emotional about it.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:90%
They get very attached to it.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.550 align:middle line:84%
It begins to enlighten
them, free them.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
get angry about it?

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, they get united
together about something.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's primal
or if it's some genetic memory

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that we have, but it's in
every single ancient race,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.750 align:middle line:84%
they went through huge
effort to make sure

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that we were aware of this,
that it would outlast them

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.250 align:middle line:90%
until now.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And this idea that we are
intelligent, eternal beings

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.850 align:middle line:84%
having a mortal experience
is not something

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that those that want to control
humanity and control the world

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:84%
want us to know, so
they suppress it.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.850 align:middle line:90%
We look at NASA, for instance.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
NASA is an administration
of the government.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.742 align:middle line:84%
We've always trusted them
because they explore space

00:31:53.742 --> 00:31:54.950 align:middle line:90%
and they've been to the moon.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.780 align:middle line:90%
They've been to Mars.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's tons of
evidence that they

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:90%
suppress what they discover.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:90%
They airbrush things.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:90%
They delete things.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.845 align:middle line:84%
They don't tell us
the whole story.

00:32:06.845 --> 00:32:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And lots of people, lots
of people are saying, why?

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Why won't you just tell
us what you've discovered?

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, please.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And it
makes us suspicious.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not just them.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It's every agency, every
bureau that we ask questions.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.530 align:middle line:10%
They either take the Fifth or
they give us redacted documents

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.430 align:middle line:10%
or they airbrush things out.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.460 align:middle line:90%
It happens every day.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You get them with
black all over the thing.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.263 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We're seeing
it all the time.

00:32:37.263 --> 00:32:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And it makes us
mistrust our government

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:84%
and that shouldn't be because
it's not really our government

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:90%
that we mistrust.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:84%
It's this agency government,
this special corporate group

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that has grown up, that
writes all of our laws.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
get so powerful, Brooks?

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That's a
very good question.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that in 1933, when
the crash had happened,

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.960 align:middle line:84%
we'd been through World
War I. The whole world was

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:90%
on its knees.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It was broken.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It needed to get
back on its feet.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this syndicate
found its opportunity.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.320 align:middle line:84%
What they would do is
they would feed people.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take
advantage of weakness.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Make people
dependent upon them.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was, not
just the Treasury of the United

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.090 align:middle line:84%
States, but the
Treasury of Europe,

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:84%
the gross domestic
product of Earth,

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:84%
actually, fell
into their control.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Fewer and fewer people gained
total control over the system.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:84%
They developed international
banking systems.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:84%
They took us off of silver
and gold as a backing to it

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and made it some
ethereal value that they

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:84%
place on it to
control the economy

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:84%
to make sure it doesn't
get too hot or too cold.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And they've basically taken
over the entire world.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, we find
ourselves in a fix.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And nobody
stopped them.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.239 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It wasn't
that people didn't try.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:11.420 align:middle line:84%
We went to war several
times over it and lost.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.409 align:middle line:84%
Each time, we had
an event take place

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:17.630 align:middle line:84%
where the people
realized that they

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.320 align:middle line:90%
were giving up their rights.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We mentioned the National
Defense Authorization Act

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.409 align:middle line:90%
in the video.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:29.179 align:middle line:84%
When 2001 occurred, before
that, in the year 2000,

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:31.761 align:middle line:84%
we would never have given up
our freedom to move about.

00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:32.719 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course not.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.343 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't even have
thought about it.

00:34:34.343 --> 00:34:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: No, we would
have never accepted it.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.610 align:middle line:84%
That act had already been
written years before,

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.830 align:middle line:84%
right after World War II, but
they couldn't implement it.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.323 align:middle line:84%
They needed an event
to implement it.

00:34:46.323 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why
so many people think

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:53.300 align:middle line:84%
this event was created
and it's disappointing,

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.639 align:middle line:90%
but who knows, right?

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That's the
question, who knows?

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:90%
And that makes us doubt.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And doubt is something that
it takes empires apart.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.484 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a supernatural
aspect to any of this?

00:35:08.484 --> 00:35:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: I believe there is.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.590 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
the ancients, a lot

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.900 align:middle line:84%
of the records talk about
shining ones or ancient beings

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.520 align:middle line:84%
or off-worlders, or fallen
angels that have sort of taught

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.170 align:middle line:84%
men, led them along, kept them
in conflict one with another.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.990 align:middle line:84%
There's even a lot
of evidence that they

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:84%
may have been responsible for
forming most of the world's

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.440 align:middle line:84%
religions, and then teaching
each religion to hate

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:90%
all the other religions.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:90%
It was perfect.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kill in the name of
religion, that's what they do.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: But now we're
seeing leaders of the world

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.840 align:middle line:84%
are going to Brussels, as it
were, to get some leadership

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.550 align:middle line:90%
or going to the Antarctic.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Crazy trips down to the
Antarctic for a few days.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.642 align:middle line:84%
John Kerry, a Pope's
representative.

00:35:59.642 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they doing there?

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well,
there's a rumor that's

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.770 align:middle line:84%
out there that in
the Antarctic are

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.314 align:middle line:90%
some of these ancient beings.

00:36:08.314 --> 00:36:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And these people are
actually going down

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.300 align:middle line:90%
for direct instruction.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And artifacts and
everything else down there?

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Could be.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.810 align:middle line:84%
The point is that by the
time you get out of Genesis,

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.850 align:middle line:84%
you're introduced to
five different races,

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:90%
none of whom are from here.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.015 align:middle line:84%
And there's no reason to
believe that they left.

00:36:26.015 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think they're
down at the South Pole?

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.269 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well,
evidence points that we

00:36:32.269 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:84%
have important world
leaders that are going

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.440 align:middle line:90%
to the South Pole for what?

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.664 align:middle line:90%
To see the penguins?

00:36:36.664 --> 00:36:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, does
that make any sense?

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: No.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:40.909 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's down there.

00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: There has to be.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.366 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe
there was a landing

00:36:43.366 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:90%
of a craft of some sort?

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, it's the
oldest, most central continent

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.440 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.960 align:middle line:84%
All the other continents
have floated around and moved

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:84%
as the crust has changed
size, but Antarctica

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.987 align:middle line:84%
has stayed right where it was
because it's right at the pole.

00:36:59.987 --> 00:37:02.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you think we'll
ever get that answer, what's

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.670 align:middle line:10%
going on there?

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: If the
people demand it,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.849 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to take
a great awareness.

00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because it is unusual.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I heard that John
Kerry was going down there,

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going, why?

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.460 align:middle line:84%
There's supposed to
be nothing there.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:84%
We also heard the Nazis
were down there, right,

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:19.970 align:middle line:90%
with a submarine base.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would make
sense that they would.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.529 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of U boats
that were unaccounted for.

00:37:24.529 --> 00:37:28.420 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of technology
that last year of the war.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:33.340 align:middle line:84%
They were moving technology
out of Norway, of Germany,

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.220 align:middle line:90%
of Austria.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:84%
They were putting it on U
boats and sailing it away.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's certainly within
their navigable ability

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.220 align:middle line:90%
to go to Antarctica.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
ancients, was there

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.180 align:middle line:84%
any unbelievable
engineering of that era

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're still
looking at today?

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:57.929 align:middle line:84%
One of the digs that was done
was at a place called Harappa.

00:37:57.929 --> 00:37:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they found

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:04.960 align:middle line:84%
as they exhumed all this
city and dug away at it

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:10.720 align:middle line:84%
is the people that appeared to
be running from something that

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:84%
were lying in the
street preserved,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.280 align:middle line:84%
but their bones were
more radioactive

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.460 align:middle line:84%
than those at ground
zero of Hiroshima.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:27.220 align:middle line:84%
There is no question whatsoever
that a thermonuclear event

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.370 align:middle line:90%
destroyed the area of Harappa.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:33.352 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know if it was a
natural thermonuclear event.

00:38:33.352 --> 00:38:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like an asteroid
strike or something, right?

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, well even
that wouldn't generate

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.760 align:middle line:90%
that wavelength of radiation.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.092 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be from a
nuclear weapon of some kind.

00:38:42.092 --> 00:38:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I think.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And it's
25,000 years old.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the
Bible address that?

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The Bible talks about
several cataclysmic-style

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:56.110 align:middle line:84%
attacks, not the least of
which is Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the entire
city turned to salt.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And Lot's wife turned
to a pillar of salt.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't
Robert Oppenheimer

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:84%
say that he got his
idea of an atomic bomb

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.150 align:middle line:90%
from reading old Sanskrit?

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, he quoted
Sanskrit at Trinity

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.560 align:middle line:90%
when the first bomb went off.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, now I've become
the destroyer of worlds.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.500 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of interesting,
that explosion.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.240 align:middle line:84%
My degree's in
nuclear chemistry,

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and I did my postgraduate
work at Oak Ridge.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So I've held sand from
Trinity in my hands.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, gosh.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Wash your hands, right?

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I'm just
telling you that they

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:84%
had a pool, like we have a
football pool or a soccer pool.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:41.410 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to decide how many
kilotons the bomb would be.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And it was funny because the--

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I forget which scientist
it was arrived last,

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:84%
all the probable
ones had been taken,

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.230 align:middle line:84%
so the only one left was,
I think, five kilotons.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.570 align:middle line:90%
So he had to pick five kilitons.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to be
almost eight kilotons,

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.050 align:middle line:84%
way more than anyone
predicted that it would be.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:04.930 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
that they would not

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:84%
light the entire
atmosphere on fire when

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.910 align:middle line:90%
they blew the bomb up.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be a
message in your work of hope,

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.140 align:middle line:84%
more so than most
people, who tend to leave

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:90%
you feeling empty-handed.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.270 align:middle line:90%
but you have hope.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.159 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I realized after
we'd done all this work

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and created all the books,
especially The Ark of Millions

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.060 align:middle line:84%
of Years, you reach this
point of doom and gloom,

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.222 align:middle line:84%
where, gosh, we're all
going to Armageddon.

00:40:30.222 --> 00:40:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's horrible.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:31.765 align:middle line:90%
We're going to die.

00:40:31.765 --> 00:40:33.515 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, what's
the point, you know?

00:40:33.515 --> 00:40:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Just give up.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But I realized in the founding
fathers, a message of hope,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:43.750 align:middle line:84%
because up until that
time, for about 5,000 years

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.150 align:middle line:84%
of recorded history,
the world was ruled

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.610 align:middle line:90%
by basically one man at a time.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:52.930 align:middle line:84%
One king, with his wooden ships
and his army ruled the world.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you were born a
baker, you were a baker.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:01.515 align:middle line:84%
There was no aspiring to be
a movie writer or a prince.

00:41:01.515 --> 00:41:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A cobbler, you
became a cobbler, whatever.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: That was it.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:08.802 align:middle line:84%
But these founding
fathers learned

00:41:08.802 --> 00:41:10.260 align:middle line:84%
to read the way
everyone else does.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.310 align:middle line:84%
They read the Bible, and
they saw the future laid out

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:15.810 align:middle line:90%
before them.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And they said, let's
choose another future.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's form a nation
where people actually

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.590 align:middle line:84%
get their rights
from God, and where

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:29.040 align:middle line:84%
they can be anything they
want to be and do anything

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:84%
they want to do to pursue
their own happiness.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:84%
It had never been
tried before, ever.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to be, of
course, wildly successful.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's no mention
of America in the Bible.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you could twist the
Old Testament anyway

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:48.390 align:middle line:84%
you want, but there's no
America in the Scriptures.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It's because they
chose another future.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:53.640 align:middle line:90%
It created a new timeline.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, the forces that controlled
the world up to that time,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:84%
they've been trying
to get control back.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And they've come very
close a couple of times,

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you, George,
very close to getting it back.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:90%
But I think--

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.761 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:42:07.761 --> 00:42:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --that it proved
to us, we, as a human race,

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.200 align:middle line:90%
can choose a new future.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to march
inexorably to Armageddon.

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.110 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to
survive all that.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.890 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to exist
for millions of years

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and explore the galaxy and be
the race we were born to be.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But can we
survive if humanity fails

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:37.120 align:middle line:90%
and if technology fails?

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:84%
David Adair, of
course, the Rocket Man,

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.330 align:middle line:84%
has been a staunch believer
in protecting our power

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:49.250 align:middle line:84%
grid from either an EMP attack
or a solar flare from the sun.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.600 align:middle line:10%
And they estimate, David, that
some 90% of just Americans

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.587 align:middle line:10%
could be dead within a year
if the power grid goes down.

00:42:55.587 --> 00:42:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Absolutely.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:57.926 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's frightening.

00:42:57.926 --> 00:42:59.329 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I can give
you a day one scenario.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.520 align:middle line:84%
One day is enough to
scare you to death.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Just in the first 30
seconds, let's say

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.862 align:middle line:84%
you're walking down a
crowded street with people,

00:43:10.862 --> 00:43:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're pushing
a baby stroller.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.740 align:middle line:84%
You've got your baby
out for a nice day.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And you see a flash, and
this could be just an EMP.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:24.120 align:middle line:84%
What will happen is all
the transformers explode.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is covered
in napalm, burning.

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.950 align:middle line:90%
You're on fire.

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Your baby's on fire.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.143 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is on fire,
running through the streets,

00:43:30.143 --> 00:43:32.830 align:middle line:84%
screaming and hollering,
don't know what's happened.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.390 align:middle line:90%
You call for help.

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:35.920 align:middle line:90%
No cell phones.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.210 align:middle line:90%
No satellites.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:38.470 align:middle line:90%
No satellite phones.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:39.880 align:middle line:90%
No landlines.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.800 align:middle line:90%
No communication of any kind.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No ATMs, no
gasoline pumps, nothing.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a dire situation,
Brooks, and it's possible.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: When the
grid was formed,

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.830 align:middle line:84%
it created some
vulnerabilities we

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:57.460 align:middle line:84%
didn't have before because we
used to have isolated systems.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:84%
The grid means that we
can move energy from, say,

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Tampa, Florida or New
York to Oklahoma if we

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.540 align:middle line:90%
want to using the power lines.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.600 align:middle line:84%
But the grid created
three vulnerabilities

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and the National Electrical
Reliability Corporation

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.150 align:middle line:84%
realized this, and they
wrote a report on it.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Those vulnerabilities
are obviously, physical

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.270 align:middle line:84%
or cyber attack, a
natural disaster,

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:25.240 align:middle line:84%
such as a flood
or a solar flare.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or an
asteroid hit, could be.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And the
third is a pandemic.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.007 align:middle line:84%
Like, everybody in
Florida gets the flu.

00:44:31.007 --> 00:44:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to run the
nuclear power plants?

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, they set up a system to
try to compensate for all that.

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And I was at that meeting.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
realize that you're

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:46.090 align:middle line:90%
creating a dependent world.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:50.170 align:middle line:84%
That if an EMP occurs, and
let's say the grid in the United

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:52.420 align:middle line:90%
States goes out.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.720 align:middle line:90%
It may go out for a week.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.374 align:middle line:84%
It may go out for
two, three years

00:44:55.374 --> 00:44:57.540 align:middle line:84%
until we get some of these
big transformers rebuilt.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by that time, the
read statistics were horrible.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:90%
But there are solutions.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.850 align:middle line:84%
There are low-voltage
local solutions

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:06.040 align:middle line:84%
that can be employed
pretty quickly

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.220 align:middle line:84%
to get systems like hospitals
or traffic systems and radios

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.810 align:middle line:90%
back up.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways to protect
if we know that it's coming.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Like a solar flare, we've
got three days warning.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.490 align:middle line:84%
We could disconnect
those transformers

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and protect them,
weather the flare,

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and then fire everything
back up again.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But if it's sudden, like
this EMP he's talking about,

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.370 align:middle line:84%
which would occur 50 to 100
miles above the planet--

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Detonated by a
rogue government, probably.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.480 align:middle line:84%
That pulse puts millions
of volts into the air,

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and the antenna is
the power lines.

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:44.060 align:middle line:84%
It's picked up and conducted
to those transformers.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.700 align:middle line:84%
That's going to occur
within one second.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.650 align:middle line:84%
There is a way to
protect all that,

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.090 align:middle line:84%
but it would take years
to implement that.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're not even
starting yet to protect it.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Some specific high-risk
areas have been hardened,

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.060 align:middle line:84%
but these substations
are everywhere.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a substation
10 miles from here.

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't
companies like Amazon,

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:10.770 align:middle line:84%
that live and die
because of electronics--

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.310 align:middle line:84%
because if the internet goes
down, they're out of business.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they get together
with power companies

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, the estimate
is a couple billion dollars

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.990 align:middle line:90%
to insulate the grid.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jeff Bezos
could write a check.

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:27.930 align:middle line:84%
He's got $150
billion in the bank.

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: This is a
legitimate question,

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and it really should
be put by the people

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.670 align:middle line:84%
to organizations that
are capable of doing it.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.230 align:middle line:90%
It is overdue.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.340 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason for society
to be at risk like this.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Earth has over seven billion
people living on it right now,

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:49.990 align:middle line:84%
but it takes power to
support seven billion people

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.790 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.480 align:middle line:84%
If the power goes away,
even for one year,

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.195 align:middle line:84%
we could see 20% of
that society disappear.

00:46:57.195 --> 00:46:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or more.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Or more.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Because no refrigeration.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.120 align:middle line:90%
The old or people that rely on--

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't pump water.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Your water pumps won't work.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.052 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And people that rely
on prescriptions for survival,

00:47:09.052 --> 00:47:10.760 align:middle line:84%
like blood pressure
medicine or diabetes.

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're gone.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: They're gone.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So it would put a tremendous
stress on the world.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Though
you're always hopeful,

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.180 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
people out there

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.360 align:middle line:90%
who claim of the apocalypse.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.620 align:middle line:90%
That we're in it.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.270 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.045 align:middle line:90%
What does Brooks Agnew think?

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, I think the
consciousness of mankind

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:31.640 align:middle line:90%
is much higher than that.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:36.770 align:middle line:10%
I think programs like Gaia TV
and others, "Coast to Coast,"

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.990 align:middle line:10%
others, are there
to enlighten people,

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:43.040 align:middle line:10%
there to give people the tools
that they need to put out

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.960 align:middle line:10%
that kind of consciousness.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.650 align:middle line:10%
As a race, we, as I said, have
this symbiotic relationship

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:50.210 align:middle line:10%
with the planet itself.

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:90%
We can overcome this.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.900 align:middle line:90%
We can supersede this.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:59.630 align:middle line:84%
There is a way for this evil
to be virtually eliminated

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:02.600 align:middle line:84%
from the planet by
this positive energy.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely,
and let's hope we do it.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Without violence
and without conflict.

with this program
he's done it again.
