>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm joined by author
and public speaker Brad

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Olsen, who will be discussing
his very latest trip

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
to Antarctica, where he spent
days searching for crafts

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:84%
buried deep into the ice, ET
civilizations, and the hole

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.290 align:middle line:90%
to the Inner Earth.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Brad, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BRAD OLSEN: Well,
thanks, George.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
It's always great to be back and
talk with you about these very

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.768 align:middle line:90%
interesting subjects.

00:00:47.768 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you end
up getting to Antarctica?

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:90%
What's the route that you take?

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: The route I took was
through southern Argentina,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.030 align:middle line:10%
which was a town
called Ushuaia, which

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:10%
is the gateway to Antarctica.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:84%
It's about 90% of
all ship traffic

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.209 align:middle line:84%
goes through
Ushuaia, both cruise

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:84%
ships and sailboats, which I
had the opportunity to go down

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:90%
on a 14-person sailboat.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's docks down there in
the South Pole and everything

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:90%
else, huh?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, there are
docks at some of the stations,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:84%
but a cruise ship port in
Ushuaia and also a yacht

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
dock, where we were able to
meet a captain and on the spot

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
get signed up for a trip
that was going down there.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you get
there, is it cold?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It is cold, but
it's a bit of a misnomer

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that it's freezing
cold every day.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:84%
We actually had
two days down there

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:90%
where it was t-shirt weather.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
We were up on the
deck in our swimsuits

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and getting a little
bit of a suntan.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And we even did
the polar plunge,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.755 align:middle line:84%
jumping in the Arctic
water with icebergs--

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --floating around.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.940 align:middle line:90%
We did, yeah.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How cold was that?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.345 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, below
freezing, but--

00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.528 align:middle line:84%
Well, you didn't stay
in there long, did you?

00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Not for very long, no.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you went
down there back in 2019.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:90%
How long did you stay?

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It was a 26-day
trip, but it took four days

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
to get down there crossing
the Drake Passage.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And we caught a storm
going in, so sea sickness

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
was prevalent
throughout the ship.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Only a few people
that didn't get it,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
fortunately they
didn't because they

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:90%
were able to sail the boat.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And it took us six
days to get back

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:84%
because we had to
tack against the wind.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you got there,
what did you start looking for?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, we first got
to the South Shetland Islands,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and there are many
bases there, including

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:90%
the Polish base, Arctowski.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And we were on a Polish
vessel out of Gdansk, Poland,

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.900 align:middle line:84%
with 11 Poles and
three Americans.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So they had pre-set up
our meeting with the base,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and we arrived with vegetables
and fruit for the base.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And they welcomed us in and
let us take showers and had

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
meals with them and a couple
nights of playing music

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:90%
and drinking.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:84%
It was quite nice to get
off the boat after that very

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.962 align:middle line:90%
rough stormy sea passage.

00:03:03.962 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it was
smart bringing the fruit,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
because without that,
no showers, right?

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I guess that
was just a complimentary gift.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.447 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, they were
very appreciative.

00:03:14.447 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of research did you

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:90%
do before you went down there?

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I've been
researching Antarctica

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
for years, but especially
on the trip leading up

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
collecting maps,
looking at Google Earth,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
going through just about
any information I could get.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, when
we were down in Ushuaia,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I started talking
to ship captains,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
asking them if
they knew anything

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
about a craft under the ice,
antediluvian civilizations,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
perhaps giants or giant fauna
being taken out of the ice,

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:90%
being excavated.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
The resounding response
was no, that people just

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:90%
didn't know about this.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not to say that
it couldn't be there,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:90%
but they just didn't know.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we were going to the
far northern tip of the Palmer

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Peninsula.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Antarctica is a big continent.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's huge.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's the fifth
largest in the world.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So the distances are
quite vast to try

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to go to some of these
inland locations.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There have been rumors
that the Nazis, after World War

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.170 align:middle line:84%
II, fled to Antarctica, went
under the ice with their subs,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and started building
bases and things.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Did you see anything like
that while you were there?

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, that's the
Neuschwabenland region

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:84%
of East Antarctica, which
is basically directly

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%
below South Africa, which, of
course, during World War II

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
was a fascist country itself and
were supporting the Nazis going

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.480 align:middle line:84%
George, when I was looking
at maps of Antarctica

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
before my trip, I came across
some Cold War era maps,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:90%
and the Nazis never left.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:84%
They still had West German
bases in Neuschwabenland.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah,
including this region

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
called the Kohnen
Base, which I found

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:84%
was the most
fascinating and perhaps

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
the best evidence for some
kind of craft under the ice.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, tell
me about that base.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.405 align:middle line:90%
How big is it?

00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It's inland.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:90%
It's only seasonal.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:90%
So right now, it's mid-April.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's getting out of
Antarctica for the season.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
There's only a skeleton
crew on the remaining base.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.438 align:middle line:84%
There's only 1,000 people
on the whole continent.

00:05:23.438 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:84%
The fifth largest continent in
the world, only 1,000 people--

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --there.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And Kohnen is one of
those seasonal bases,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
so they have already
left and gone

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:84%
to the Neumayer Base, which is
the other German base, which

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.450 align:middle line:90%
is in Neuschwabenland.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.727 align:middle line:84%
And so the Kohnen
Base, in 2013--

00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when
you say Kohnen Base,

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm expecting equipment
and buildings and things.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.168 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's there?

00:05:46.168 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, according
to the Antarctic Treaty,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
you can't leave anything
there permanently.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So everything is always
in a temporary state.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes in
these seasonal bases,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:84%
they'll just pull
everything out.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So it'll look like
hardly anything is there

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
if they're not doing any
research between seasons.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you went to
Google Earth right now,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
you would just see what look
like circus tent poles popping

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
up that presumably are hoisting
up a giant tarp covering up

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.372 align:middle line:84%
what could be something very
interesting under the ice.

00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to take a
look at some pictures with you

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.345 align:middle line:84%
on this base, and
you kind of describe

00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:26.470 align:middle line:90%
what we're looking at here.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Sure.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at our first picture.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.028 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, this is
what it would look like.

00:06:32.028 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:84%
These would be those tent poles
holding up like a circus tent,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:90%
as best as I could describe it.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right now, Brad,
here's our second picture.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.822 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:06:42.822 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it was clearly
some kind of excavation

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
on the top there
because all the snow

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.470 align:middle line:90%
and ice has been perturbed.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
You can also see just a
little off the picture

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:84%
there is a landing strip
and then a route, which

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
looks like snowmobile tracks
coming down to this area

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.112 align:middle line:84%
where they're doing some
excavation and some work.

00:07:03.112 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big is this
area we're looking at?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, this would be
about a mile or so across.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I understand the
craft that you see

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom there is
about half a mile long.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So there is something
down there that

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
is not symmetrical
or in such a way

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that it looks like
it's fabricated.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
saying, when you

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
say there's something down
there, you mean under the ice?

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's correct.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Because when they covered it
up, it's just the tent poles

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:84%
that you can see on
Google Earth today.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you go in
the Wayback Machine,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:84%
this is what you
would see in 2013.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How thick is
this ice here, Brad?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: This is on top of
the Polar Plateau, which

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.185 align:middle line:90%
is two miles thick.

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez, huge.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And then when you consider that
Antarctica is the most actively

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
volcanic continent
in the world, you

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
have the propensity for
these large cavities

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:90%
to be below the ice.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, and here's
our next picture, which--

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, it gives
you an idea of not only

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:84%
the size of this
thing, but the symmetry

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
involved, how all
the spines of it

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
are exactly the
same on both sides.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Nature doesn't create
symmetry like that, George.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you see some
tracks off on both sides

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
that people were cruising around
on snowmobiles presumably.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is on these
Cold War maps as well.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
This Kohnen Base has been
there at least since the 1980s.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who built it?

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it's
unknown who built it,

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.315 align:middle line:84%
but who's been researching it
have been the Germans since--

00:08:39.315 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is anybody
allowed to go there?

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I don't think so.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Any country?

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.211 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You'd need
some kind of permission

00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:84%
through the German government
because it is their base.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're
controlling it?

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, and
each base is kind

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.520 align:middle line:84%
of like an embassy is,
that they're controlled

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:90%
by the country of origin.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So you'd need permission
through that country.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why the fascination
with Antarctica, Brad?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it's kind of
the final frontier, George.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I know,
I'm the only researcher

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:84%
in this field who's actually
been down there to investigate

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
some of these great mysteries.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's chock full of
mysteries, so many lost

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
civilizations we've
heard of, from pyramids

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
poking through the ice to
antediluvian civilization

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to these giant craft
being down there.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of
wanted to try to get

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of these
things and see if anybody

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.297 align:middle line:90%
knew some of this information.

00:09:28.297 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were
to put the United

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
States on top of Antarctica,
how would the size compare?

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it's
bigger than the lower 48.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:84%
It's about the lower 48 and
most of Canada combined.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's a
pretty good size continent.

00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:41.745 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:09:41.745 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Are you in wonderment
about this continent?

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I sure am.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It was about as close as you
could get to going off planet.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Things are so
different down there

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
frozen continent.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:84%
99% of the land
is covered in ice.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:84%
You lose all the primary
colors except for blue,

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:84%
so there's no reds
or greens of trees.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just black and
white and blue are

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:84%
the primary main colors
you see down there.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And it occurred to me one day
when we were on the sailboat.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I went scuba diving
really deep one time

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
at the Blue Hole
in Dahab, Egypt,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and you lose all
those colors as well.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just blue and
white and black

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:84%
when you go really
deep, over 200 feet.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of like
this other world

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that you get when
you go scuba diving.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It's quite a different
scene of Earth

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:90%
than you've seen anywhere else.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.702 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael Salla, of
course, is a great researcher,

00:10:40.702 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and I had a chance
to interview him

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
on "Beyond Belief"
about Antarctica

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and got his thoughts on what he
thinks might be under the ice.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:10%
The craft that you say
might be down there now

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:10%
that they're launching.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:10%
Might they be what we
consider to be UFOs here

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.310 align:middle line:10%
when we see things?

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.218 align:middle line:10%
Could it be those craft?

00:11:01.218 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL SALLA: Well, we
need to kind of differentiate

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:10%
between these ancient
motherships that came down

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:10%
after this kind of
catastrophe on Mars

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.345 align:middle line:10%
that kind of landed
in Antarctica

00:11:14.345 --> 00:11:15.595 align:middle line:10%
or crash landed in Antarctica.

00:11:15.595 --> 00:11:17.898 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And those
were from ETs, right?

00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:10%
>>SALLA: Those were
extraterrestrial,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle line:10%
and they formed the hub
of the civilization that

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:10%
became Planet Y. But then
after the ice sheets began

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:10%
to grow after the catastrophe
and this was all buried

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:10%
under the ice, then you
had the Germans coming

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:10%
during the Second World
War building a space

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:10%
program, these fleets of
spacecraft that has now

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:10%
become a transnational
program that operates out

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:10%
of Antarctica.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:10%
And they can be very large
craft, a whole range of craft.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
triangle-shaped craft,

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:10%
dart-shaped craft.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The Phoenix Lights,
1997, mile-long object

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.610 align:middle line:10%
they think they saw.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:10%
Might it have
originated down there?

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:10%
>>SALLA: Well, it could be.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we don't
know whether that

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.012 align:middle line:10%
was a genuine extraterrestrial
kind of triangle

00:12:08.012 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:10%
or whether-- because
that was very large.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:10%
It seemed to be much
larger than the TR-3B

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:10%
that many researchers
have been describing,

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:10%
which is about 600 feet in size.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.350 align:middle line:10%
Whereas the Phoenix
Lights, some estimate

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:10%
that to be like a mile wide.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking about
something that if it's not

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial, it belongs to
something much more advanced,

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:10%
whether we're talking better
a navy space program out

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:10%
of, say, Utah or
whether we're talking

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:10%
about a kind of transnational
program out of Antarctica.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing, Brad.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I have the greatest
respect for Dr. Salla.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
We've worked together,
different conferences,

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and we were on "Ancient
Aliens" together one time.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:84%
He has some
incredible information

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
he gave to me right
before my trip.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
When I told him I was going
to the Palmer Peninsula,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:84%
he said to try to get
down to Rothschild Island.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:84%
He said that there
may be some kind

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of weather manipulation going
on from this particular island.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get even
close, but certainly I

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
was watching down in the
southern part of the Palmer

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Peninsula, if we had seen
any kind of perturbations

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:90%
in the clouds.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe HAARP can
sometimes make clouds look

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:90%
like the bottom of the sand.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't see
that, nor did we

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
see any chem trail activity
or any kind of flyovers.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:84%
It's very desolate
down there, George.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.395 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the
Germans that are

00:13:38.395 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
down at the Kohnen
station are excavating

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
for some kind of hidden craft,
like Michael was hinting at?

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I think
in 2013, they certainly

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.270 align:middle line:84%
were, as we could see from
those Google Earth photos.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.445 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They may have gotten
what they were looking for,

00:13:52.445 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:90%
and then they covered it up.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And then when the remote
viewers went down there

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:84%
with Courtney Brown out
of The Farsight Institute

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and said that they had
gone into the craft,

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.427 align:middle line:84%
the remote viewers did, and
said that this is nothing--

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through remote viewing?

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That this was
nothing natural made,

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
that this had been fashioned
or built by some kind of higher

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.178 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was human
or extraterrestrial,

00:14:15.178 --> 00:14:16.200 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't tell.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:84%
But there is
something down there.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So when you get the data
points that match up,

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.040 align:middle line:84%
then I think there is more
credibility to the claim

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
that this is something
under the ice.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the craft
that could be under there,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:90%
how big, do you think?

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well,
that's the question.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:84%
As you mentioned with
the Phoenix Lights,

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.680 align:middle line:84%
about a mile long,
that's a figure

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I keep hearing too, about
a half mile to a mile in--

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sheesh.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, diameter.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could that
be a mothership?

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: If that's what
we define them as, yeah.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, much bigger than any
kind of craft that we know of

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.370 align:middle line:90%
or that we could make by humans.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as large as a
battleship basically.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think it was
there and then got frozen over?

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Because why is it still there?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't it leave?

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it must have either landed
and couldn't take off again

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
or landed and got
frozen in the ice

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and has just been left
there for posterity.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And I will go so
far as to say, I

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:84%
think the Germans chose this
particular region of Antarctica

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:90%
because of this craft.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
gone inland, they

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:90%
had found it in the late 1930s.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, they were
fascinated with the occult.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
They were fascinated
with anything

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial they
could get their hands on,

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
including a crash in the
Black Forest in the 1930s

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and working with Mussolini,
who had a craft in Italy.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So they were very keen on
backward engineering anything

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:90%
they could get their hands on.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And if they had located
this during the Schumacher

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:84%
expeditions of
the late 1930s, it

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
would have been enough reason
for them to claim this area.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
countries might

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:84%
be aware of this kind
of situation down there?

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, I think
a lot of people

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:90%
are aware in high government.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
hide it, can you?

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: You can't hide it.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.415 align:middle line:84%
And if we're talking about
it because we've seen it

00:16:11.415 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
on Google Earth, it
would seem that anybody

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:90%
has access to this.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the craft
protruding out at all?

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it had
been in 2013, as we saw.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But then they put some
kind of covering over it.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
a cover over it.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And the last time
I went to those GPS

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
coordinates, it had looked
like the first slide we saw,

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
with just like all these
circus tent poles sticking out.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this craft is pretty
high up on the surface, right?

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, which may lead
us to think that perhaps it's

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:90%
not as old as it could be.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's on the
top of the Polar Plateau--

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instead of under.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Being very old and being
underneath, that perhaps it's

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:90%
a newer arrival.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if it's still
functioning and there are--

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Great question.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.998 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --occupants
in there and they're

00:16:56.998 --> 00:16:59.773 align:middle line:84%
just living, doing
whatever they do?

00:16:59.773 --> 00:17:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Wouldn't
that be a game changer

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god, huge.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --if we were
to find that out?

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:03.075 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:03.075 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we
ever find this out?

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, this is the
great interesting question

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:90%
about Antarctica.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe disclosure is right
here on planet Earth, George.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe all we need
to do is find out

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:84%
what's inside that craft at the
Kohnen Base or other locations

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
where there are presumed
craft in Antarctica.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can't we get a
United Nations team together?

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
We can barely get a United
Nations team together

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:90%
for anything.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But just to go down there with
the Russians and the Germans

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and us and any other country
and just get this done?

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.742 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they don't want
us to know about it.

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it's
been they don't

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.250 align:middle line:84%
want us to know about
it for all this time.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But now that we
have the new Space

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Force, a new arm of the
armed forces coming in,

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.930 align:middle line:84%
perhaps in this new age of
disclosure, something like this

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.758 align:middle line:90%
could happen.

00:17:49.758 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us more about
the remote viewers and some

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:90%
of the things they saw.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, Courtney Brown
is the head of The Farsight

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Institute, and
they did a project

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
where they were using their
remote viewers to go directly

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:84%
to the Kohnen Base
to investigate.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And they said first, that it was
certainly nothing natural made,

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and that's quite evident
by the symmetry we

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:90%
saw in that picture.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And two, they got into the
chambers of this craft.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall any sign
of life that they saw.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.780 align:middle line:84%
They certainly, I think,
would have brought that up.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But they did say that there
were massive cavities.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:90%
They were fashioned.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:90%
They were built.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
see technology?

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.345 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They saw technology.

00:18:35.345 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wonder what that--

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.553 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I don't think it
was functioning, though.

00:18:38.553 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
This particular one
does seem to be defunct.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe they left
it, got in another craft,

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.083 align:middle line:90%
and took off.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Or perhaps there is
more nearby that they could--

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could
be all over the place.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: All over the place.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing about
Antarctica, George.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:84%
It is such a mystery
down there because you've

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
got two miles of ice
over the Polar Plateau.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
You have volcanoes that create
giant cavities underneath,

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:84%
which create temperate
climates and fresh water.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Even the possibility
of growing food

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:90%
if you had UV lights down there.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I suspect that some of
the craft might have been here

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and then something happened
where it froze over

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't get away.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.605 align:middle line:90%
Something fast.

00:19:23.605 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That is a common
narrative that I've heard

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:84%
as well, that they got
trapped there, then--

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe an asteroid hit
and changed the planet quickly

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we've heard of
these woolly mammoths being

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
found frozen with food
still in their mouths.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.198 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So whatever happened,
they flash froze instantly.

00:19:41.198 --> 00:19:43.115 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Like a pole
shift just occurred and--

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.127 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just boom.

00:19:44.127 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Perhaps even moved
the continent to its present

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
location--

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Probably shifted it.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --from
a warmer climate.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Because they have found
fossils down there.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a mountain
called Mount Buckley.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It's at the very top of
the Beardmore Glacier,

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
Scott expedition got

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
held up because
they were collecting

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:90%
all of these fossils of ferns.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
doing the race

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
to the pole with Roald
Amundsen of Norway,

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
who beat them there
by only 35 days,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle line:84%
the Scott party
couldn't make it back

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:84%
to their final stash of food,
and they all died on the ice,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:90%
where Amundsen--

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --made it
back to his ship.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we've had a lot
of fatalities down there.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, it's
a dangerous place.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the most inhospitable
conditions on Earth.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you get stuck
down there, your life

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:90%
is certainly in danger.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were
your living conditions

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.792 align:middle line:90%
when you were down there?

00:20:33.792 --> 00:20:34.905 align:middle line:90%
Did you stay on the ship?

00:20:34.905 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Every night.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you'd wander
onto the mainland, come back

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.313 align:middle line:90%
to the ship?

00:20:41.313 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's right.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of a misnomer
that we had to get permission

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:90%
to go everywhere.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:90%
We had a zodiac on the boat.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.400 align:middle line:84%
We were able to go off
and get close to whales.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And the whales, they
have no fear of humans.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.647 align:middle line:84%
They come up to you
instead of run away.

00:20:56.647 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They probably
don't know what humans are.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They don't.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:90%
We had one--

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fish food.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --swim right
under our boat even.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And the penguins just
have no fear of humans.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
You could go right up
to one with your iPhone

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:90%
to take a picture.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And the mother with
her little baby

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
right there is kind of
like, get out of my way.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't snap at
you or anything like that?

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No, not at all.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what you are.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
if all that ice melts?

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:90%
What do we see?

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Paint us a picture.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We see the
oldest continent

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, which is
over 3 billion years

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
old on the Eastern
plate of Antarctica.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
say the oldest continent,

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:84%
wasn't it all formed
together, this whole planet?

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It was all
formed together.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of Pangea,
Gondwanaland, and it broke off.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.193 align:middle line:84%
It had once been connected
with New Zealand and Australia.

00:21:44.193 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It floated
that far, huh?

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It floated that far.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And it has fossil records that
match in those other countries

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if
everything melted,

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.813 align:middle line:90%
might we see craft there?

00:21:58.813 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We might
see craft there.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:84%
We might see antediluvian
civilization there.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.070 align:middle line:84%
We might see perhaps
civilizations

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:84%
that have a way of
existing under the ice.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How crystal clear is
the night sky down there, Brad?

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.672 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, it's as
clear as you can imagine.

00:22:15.672 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's in
the Southern Hemisphere,

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:90%
so all the stars are different.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:90%
You see the Southern Cross.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.790 align:middle line:90%
You see the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's
hard to imagine,

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.123 align:middle line:84%
but you're right,
everything's flipped over.

00:22:26.123 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, totally
different night sky.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you see
any objects zooming by

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We did not,
but we had heard reports

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
from another base,
Argentinian base, that

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:84%
had seen some craft the month
before we were down there.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And they had talked about it
through the different bases,

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and it got to the
Brown Base personnel.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of twisted the
guy's arm a little bit

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
to get it out of
him, that they had

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:84%
seen a sighting at one
of their bases of orbs

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:90%
and craft, a flyover.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And that base, the
Belgrano II Base

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:84%
where they had the sighting,
is in East Antarctica,

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:84%
not too far away from
the Neuschwabenland claim

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:90%
of Germany.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many bases
are down there, Brad?

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: There's
about 56 bases run

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:90%
by about 25 or 30 countries.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.080 align:middle line:90%
All--

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, so a
lot of countries.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, even some really
small countries like Uruguay

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:90%
has a base even.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they doing?

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, they're
mostly doing weather research

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:84%
or studying the animals,
studying the climate,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:90%
studying the ocean.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.880 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of climate
change going on down there.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:84%
There was a map that came out
just before our trip from NASA

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:84%
that showed certain
parts of Antarctica

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:55.400 align:middle line:84%
were melting very, very quickly,
and other parts, paradoxically,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:90%
were gaining in ice.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And this could be the reason
why we haven't seen huge swings

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.542 align:middle line:90%
in sea level rising.

00:24:02.542 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That could be.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.882 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That somehow
Mother Nature just

00:24:04.882 --> 00:24:05.142 align:middle line:90%
has a way to balance.

00:24:05.142 --> 00:24:06.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But don't
you find it unusual

00:24:06.725 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that there are so many
countries down there working

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.780 align:middle line:90%
in such a desolate area?

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:90%
Something else is going on here.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, it
would sure seem so.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:10%
And at the South Pole base,
which is the Amundsen-Scott

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:10%
South Pole Base, there is
a huge no fly zone over one

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:10%
of the portions
of the South Pole.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And this corresponds with what
some of the whistleblowers that

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
have spoken to
Linda Moulton Howe

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:84%
have said, that there is
a huge hole under the ice

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.410 align:middle line:84%
right near there, that this
is some kind of entrance

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:84%
into the Inner Earth or just
some kind of massive cavity

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that goes below
the Polar Plateau.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Admiral Byrd, when
he made his so-called discovery

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.940 align:middle line:84%
of the hollow Earth, was going
in through the North Pole,

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:90%
I believe, right?

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And it's presumed
that there are holes on both

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:90%
of the top and the bottom.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brooks Agnew is a
good friend of mine,

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.462 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking at
doing an expedition to--

00:25:02.462 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's been
working on that.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.915 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --the North
Pole region, yeah.

00:25:04.915 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wanted to
rent a Russian trawler

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:90%
to get down there.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: He wants
me to go with him,

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.682 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to take a look.

00:25:09.682 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
He says he has the coordinates
of the hole in the North Pole,

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and we know where the
hole in the South Pole is.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:84%
My only concern
is, we're probably

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
not going to be allowed to
go, that someone like the NSA,

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.158 align:middle line:84%
who controls a lot of things
concerning UFOs, might show up

00:25:27.158 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, you're going to
stop your boat right here.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have any
pictures under the planet Earth?

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, has NASA ever conducted
any flybys underneath it?

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:84%
You look at the planet
as a whole out in space.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:41.960 align:middle line:84%
You've got the North
Pole, the South Pole.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But in order to see
the bottom, to see

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:84%
if there's a hole
up there, you got

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:84%
to get under the
planet like that.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Have we done that?

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, we have,
and I have a couple photos

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:84%
in my presentation, The Hidden
Anomalies of Antarctica,

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
that I go to conferences
and show them.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Are they Photoshopped?

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you that for sure.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Do they look real?

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, of course.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of Photoshop does.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does it look like?

00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it just looks
like a massive hole in the ice,

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a drain?

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.252 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Like a big
drain hole, yeah.

00:26:11.252 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's so huge, George,
that Admiral Byrd's account

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
of flying a plane into it
safely, turning around,

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and coming back out
wouldn't be a problem.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.020 align:middle line:90%
It's that big.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.395 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
and you don't even

00:26:21.395 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:84%
know you're flying into it
because of the curvature,

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I
think you can see it.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And according to "Brian
S," Linda Moulton Howe's

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.940 align:middle line:84%
whistleblower who flew
over it against orders--

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
but they had an
emergency evacuation,

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.690 align:middle line:90%
and that's why they did it--

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
he said from the South Pole
station he saw tracks--

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
it's really not that far away,
only about 10, 15 miles away--

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and a road going down
into it on the ice.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:52.172 align:middle line:84%
So you could take like a snowcat
down into the hole on a road.

00:26:52.172 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And come back.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.088 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: And come back.

00:26:54.088 --> 00:26:55.775 align:middle line:90%
Or fly in and fly out.

00:26:55.775 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say,
of all the continents

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
that we have on this
planet, that Antarctica

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
might be the one that has all
these very strange anomalies?

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it is, George,
because we have 7.6 billion

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:84%
people on the planet, but only
1,000 people down in the whole

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.500 align:middle line:90%
continent--

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --of
Antarctica right now.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's vast.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's vast,
and it's the size

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.842 align:middle line:90%
of two Australias combined.

00:27:21.842 --> 00:27:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's only
1,000 people, so--

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the entire
continent ice and snow?

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Over 99% of the
landmass of Antarctica

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:90%
is covered with ice and snow.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.597 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
mountains down there?

00:27:32.597 --> 00:27:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Huge mountains.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.862 align:middle line:84%
The tallest mountain is Vinson
Massif, and it's 14,500--

00:27:38.862 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa!

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --feet.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So you
have a lot of people

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:84%
that want to climb all the
highest peaks of the world,

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and so, of course, they
have to go to Antarctica

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
to climb all seven
continents' highest mountain.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The wonders of
gravity, because you're actually

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:90%
standing upside down.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, but you--

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aren't you?

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --feel the same way.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.663 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I mean,
technically, you are, but--

00:28:00.663 --> 00:28:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
feel different at all--

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Not at all.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --standing upside down?

00:28:03.675 --> 00:28:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No, no.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't feel that?

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: When I was
in Australia, George,

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.630 align:middle line:84%
they have a funny map down there
they call Up Over Down Under,

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and they flip the
world map upside down.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:84%
It looks so foreign
to us because we're

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:90%
used to it one way.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it, up,
down, below, sideways, it's

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.020 align:middle line:90%
all the same planet.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think Antarctica looked

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.292 align:middle line:90%
like before it got iced over?

00:28:27.292 --> 00:28:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, that's
what's really fascinating

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.480 align:middle line:84%
because Antarctica was once
a very temperate climate.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:84%
There were dinosaur
species that can only

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:84%
live in warm climates that
are unique to Antarctica--

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.595 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --that have been
found only on this continent.

00:28:41.595 --> 00:28:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Trees,
vegetation, everything?

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Very unique
to Antarctica.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And the fossil record
shows that it had once been

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.470 align:middle line:90%
a steaming jungle as well.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So before the ice covered it,
it was a very temperate, even

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.910 align:middle line:84%
tropical climate down there,
with a whole host of animal,

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.940 align:middle line:90%
insect, and flora species.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
happened to the planet

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.430 align:middle line:84%
to create that kind of
ice sheet down there?

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, as you mentioned
with the Siberian mammoths that

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.935 align:middle line:84%
still had food in their mouths,
there were some sort of--

00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:15.102 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:29:15.102 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --sudden cataclysm.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a pole shift
that would have shifted

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
continents around, rising,
falling, volcanoes going off,

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:90%
tidal waves all over the place.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And this could have been the
opportunity of the continent

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to shift down to that
Southern Hemisphere

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and been locked
into place, and then

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.322 align:middle line:84%
the snow and ice
accumulated over time.

00:29:37.322 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there frozen lakes
there and things like that?

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: There sure are.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.040 align:middle line:84%
There are a whole series of
lakes underneath the ice,

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:84%
including river systems that
are now being mapped out.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:51.820 align:middle line:84%
The largest lake, Lake Vostok,
is as large as Lake Ontario.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, it's--

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.033 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --one of the top 10
largest lakes in the world,

00:29:56.033 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's completely locked
under the two miles of ice

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:90%
on the Polar Plateau.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.257 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you live there,
or would you go stir crazy?

00:30:03.257 --> 00:30:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: [LAUGHS]

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:84%
I would love to go to some
of these under ice situations

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:90%
to check them out.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god, yeah.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I don't know if I
could live there too long

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:84%
or if anybody would
want to, but it

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:84%
would seem that it's
possible with all

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:90%
the geothermal activities.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:90%
You could take a hot spring.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.580 align:middle line:84%
You could be in sort
of a warmer climate

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.220 align:middle line:84%
away from the harsh
elements above.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think the light would
be really fascinating during

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:90%
the long 24-hour summer days--

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.611 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --of just like
a blue hue of light

00:30:34.611 --> 00:30:35.486 align:middle line:90%
coming from the dome.

00:30:35.486 --> 00:30:36.944 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your
Circadian clock would

00:30:36.944 --> 00:30:39.012 align:middle line:90%
be all thrown out of whack.

00:30:39.012 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And that's
what people say

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.610 align:middle line:84%
who work on these
year-round bases, that it

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:84%
does start to drive you
a little stir crazy.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
under the land mass?

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.407 align:middle line:84%
All ocean underneath
it, do you think?

00:30:51.407 --> 00:30:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it's like
in any kind of continent.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:90%
It is a landmass.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, it has a large
polar plateau on top of it.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, sometimes
I think of a continent

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
of landmass couple miles thick
floating on top of water,

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:90%
but it's not shifting.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:14.405 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
case, I would assume

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:18.920 align:middle line:84%
that the landmass is connected
to the bottom of the seabed.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Well, it is.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a very old continent.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
holding it in place, right?

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and if you look at the
under ocean topography maps,

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:84%
you have the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, which comes down

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.150 align:middle line:84%
the entire length of
the Atlantic Ocean,

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and it connects to Antarctica
right in Neuschwabenland.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's where a lot
of volcanic activity

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.330 align:middle line:90%
and hot springs are.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:84%
This is one of
the tectonic fault

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.850 align:middle line:84%
lines that travels
through Antarctica as well

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.580 align:middle line:84%
as up the Palmer
Peninsula, where

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.760 align:middle line:84%
there are a whole bunch
of volcanoes as well.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And we got to visit
some of those.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some time ago,
former Secretary of State

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.120 align:middle line:84%
John Kerry made a
visit down there.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Why in the world
would he go there?

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:05.960 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there, Brad?

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And why would he go
during the election between

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Hillary Clinton and--

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Donald Trump.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --Donald Trump?

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Why would he go there at
the most critical time

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.160 align:middle line:90%
for his party?

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I have a friend that
works at the McMurdo Station.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he's just left
a couple of days ago.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Was posting a lot of his
pictures on Facebook.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And he was down there
when Kerry was there,

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and they landed at McMurdo,
took a day or two to acclimate.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they disappeared
for a couple days

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.590 align:middle line:84%
before they came back, and
nobody knew where they went.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So it was quite interesting
that they used McMurdo

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.130 align:middle line:84%
as a jumping point
to go further inland

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.943 align:middle line:90%
to some undisclosed location.

00:32:47.943 --> 00:32:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there an
airport down there?

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, there's
air strips on the ice.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:90%
You can land--

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you stop?

00:32:53.835 --> 00:32:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Well, it's--

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, is it all ice?

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.257 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, it's all ice.

00:32:57.257 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But just like a runway, I think
you can put the brakes on,

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:01.310 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they don't have
concrete or anything like that?

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No, they don't.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.705 align:middle line:90%
It's all landing on the ice.

00:33:05.705 --> 00:33:07.205 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's amazing.

00:33:07.205 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But they can
make the runway as long

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.890 align:middle line:90%
as they need to make it.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how would
you stop on ice flying

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.175 align:middle line:90%
in at 200 or 300 miles an hour?

00:33:15.175 --> 00:33:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And there are
these big cargo planes

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:90%
that come and go all the time.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
My friend that worked down
there, that was his job

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.748 align:middle line:84%
was loading and
offloading these planes.

00:33:23.748 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's truly
remarkable, isn't it?

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Mm-hmm.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you go again?

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.997 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, I'd
love to go again.

00:33:28.997 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to go down to
the Neuschwabenland area.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to go with
a Geiger counter, George,

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.020 align:middle line:90%
and that is because--

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:39.130 align:middle line:84%
do you remember Project
Argus in the late 1950s?

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:90%
It was these top secret US--

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.748 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:33:41.748 --> 00:33:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --nuclear tests.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.325 align:middle line:84%
They were saying that they
were doing high atmospheric--

00:33:45.325 --> 00:33:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Down there, right?

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Down there in
the Southern Ocean just

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:84%
off the shore of
Antarctica, just

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.120 align:middle line:84%
off the shore of
Neuschwabenland.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.740 align:middle line:84%
But to go to
Neuschwabenland and go

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.410 align:middle line:84%
to this Point 211,
the new Berlin base,

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.660 align:middle line:84%
with a Geiger counter
and see if they actually

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.773 align:middle line:90%
nuked this old German base.

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
some more looks

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:84%
at what could be a hole
in the Antarctic area.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at some of these.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, there's a hole there.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.337 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's what
it looks like for sure,

00:34:14.337 --> 00:34:16.170 align:middle line:84%
including what might
be that road coming in.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how big
do you think that is?

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.045 align:middle line:84%
What's the diameter
of that hole?

00:34:19.045 --> 00:34:19.845 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:34:19.845 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, several
miles across.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That big?

00:34:22.315 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, look at the
curvature of the Earth on top.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:27.449 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking
from outer space at it.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:29.596 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, is
that an asteroid hit?

00:34:29.596 --> 00:34:30.929 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's a good question.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:35.145 align:middle line:84%
How it was formed, I don't
have any information on that.

00:34:35.145 --> 00:34:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
look at the other picture

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:84%
and compare that
to this one here.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Once again,
shooting from outer space

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:43.344 align:middle line:90%
looking down on it.

00:34:43.344 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that the
hole to the right?

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:45.965 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's it.

00:34:45.965 --> 00:34:46.929 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you can compare it
to the curvature of the Earth,

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:90%
you can see how massive it is.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And there is a satellite
shooting from outer space

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:90%
and looking down on it.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, why
aren't these pictures being

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.077 align:middle line:90%
shown to the public by NASA?

00:35:03.077 --> 00:35:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's a good question.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just like how the Space
Station always blocks out

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
every time there's a presumed
UFO sighting from the Space

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Station.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Why do they do that?

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:13.860 align:middle line:84%
They're still trying
to hold information.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
that's remarkable.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.762 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It really is.

00:35:16.762 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, clearly,
there's a hole there.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know
how deep it goes.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:21.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I think
it would go at least

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.700 align:middle line:84%
down to the continental
plate level, which

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.290 align:middle line:90%
would be over two miles deep.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would there be water
down at the bottom of the hole?

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:30.885 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Well, there are.

00:35:30.885 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:90%
There are lakes down there.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole area
called the Lake District

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.440 align:middle line:84%
because there's so many
lakes, freshwater lakes too,

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as hot
springs percolating up

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.632 align:middle line:90%
through the fault lines.

00:35:43.632 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aside from
the North Pole,

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.990 align:middle line:84%
are there any other areas that
are just as perplexing as what

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.610 align:middle line:90%
we've been seeing?

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I think Antarctica
is even more perplexing

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:84%
than the North Pole
because, of course,

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that's on the Arctic
Ocean, and it's just

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.670 align:middle line:84%
ice floating on
water, where this

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.640 align:middle line:84%
is a whole continent
that is virtually

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.840 align:middle line:90%
unknown and unexplored.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.840 align:middle line:84%
It really is the final
frontier on planet Earth

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.710 align:middle line:90%
for exploration.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the climate
down there changing at all?

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's
changing very rapidly.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.780 align:middle line:84%
The area we were at was
showing huge sheets of ice

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that were melting and just
dropping in elevation,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and we even saw the
calving of glaciers.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.520 align:middle line:84%
George, it's one thing
I'll never forget,

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.660 align:middle line:84%
these massive sides
of a wall of glacier

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.170 align:middle line:84%
just dropping down
into the water.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Fortunately, we
were a couple miles away.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could you hear it?

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.995 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, first you
see it, then you hear it.

00:36:34.995 --> 00:36:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The sound is
a little slower, right?

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:38.453 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: A little
slower, and then you

00:36:38.453 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:84%
see the waves starting
to percolate out.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to
fashion our boat

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.258 align:middle line:84%
to go directly into the
wave because when they hit--

00:36:46.258 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're like mini
tsunamis, aren't they?

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --a mini
tsunami is created.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's look
at this NASA picture, which

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.895 align:middle line:90%
they talk about climate change.

00:36:53.895 --> 00:36:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.900 align:middle line:90%
So what are we looking at here?

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.070 align:middle line:90%
What is this shape?

00:36:59.070 --> 00:36:59.370 align:middle line:90%
Is this the continent?

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That is the Polar
Plateau in the middle.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's the
Transantarctic Mountains that

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.202 align:middle line:84%
go up the side, and
that's the Palmer

00:37:05.202 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Peninsula where I visited.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:10%
So basically, that finger
on top that's all red

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:10%
was signs of great
melting, calving ice,

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.930 align:middle line:10%
the glaciers are
lowering in elevation.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.590 align:middle line:10%
But the blue areas-- and
this was produced by NASA--

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.630 align:middle line:10%
those colors just
represent the areas

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.480 align:middle line:10%
that are melting or
increasing in ice,

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:10%
and that's the blue area.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.570 align:middle line:10%
So somehow Mother Nature
knows to balance itself out,

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.470 align:middle line:10%
and that's why Miami Beach
and other sea level cities

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:41.230 align:middle line:10%
have not experienced
huge sea level rises.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, is this the
whole continent, or most of it?

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, that just gets
cut off at the bottom there,

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how come we
can't see a hole from here?

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I have
images in my presentation

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.090 align:middle line:84%
where Google Earth
masks off certain areas.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.532 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes very sloppily
they'll just put a white--

00:37:59.532 --> 00:38:01.365 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there could
be holes there but--

00:38:01.365 --> 00:38:02.115 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: There could be, but--

00:38:02.115 --> 00:38:03.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --they're covered up.

00:38:03.365 --> 00:38:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --they're covered up.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been traveling
around the world searching

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.908 align:middle line:90%
for different anomalies.

00:38:07.908 --> 00:38:09.450 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
this all your life.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:13.442 align:middle line:84%
What would you say about this
area compared to other spots?

00:38:13.442 --> 00:38:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I've been to
all seven continents now,

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.380 align:middle line:84%
George, and I'll
say that Antarctica

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.720 align:middle line:84%
is unlike any other
place on Earth.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely frozen
desolate otherworldly climate

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.740 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
visiting another planet

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.730 align:middle line:90%
in many respects.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:84%
The animals have
no fear of humans,

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and the ice is just so vast,
covering just about everything

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and coming right
down to the water.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a place that you'll
never forget if you see it.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might there be a hidden
submarine base down there?

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, there could
be multiple submarine bases

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.108 align:middle line:84%
down there, and we
wouldn't know it

00:38:52.108 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:84%
because not only would
it be under the ice,

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.760 align:middle line:90%
it would be under the water.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:84%
But we do know from some leaked
documents of the Third Reich

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:84%
that they had mapped out
the region, including what

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.510 align:middle line:84%
were routes that could be
taken by submarines to go

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.580 align:middle line:90%
to some very remote locations.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say that's the
route Hitler took to escape

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.605 align:middle line:90%
to Argentina, assuming he did.

00:39:17.605 --> 00:39:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Well, that's right.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And Admiral Donitz, who
then assumed the Fuhrer

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.980 align:middle line:84%
at the very tail
end of the war, he

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.320 align:middle line:84%
was known as saying
in 1943 that they

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.220 align:middle line:84%
had built "an impregnable
fortress for our Fuhrer

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.080 align:middle line:90%
in a land of ice."

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is the new Berlin
base in Neuschwabenland.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:42.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the place that I would
like to go to with a film crew,

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:90%
maybe yourself.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.783 align:middle line:84%
We can go down there
on an exploration.

00:39:44.783 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe I can do
remotes for "Coast to Coast"

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:47.750 align:middle line:90%
down that way, huh?

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.042 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Wouldn't that be cool?

00:39:49.042 --> 00:39:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we'll get our
buddies at "Beyond Belief"

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.240 align:middle line:90%
to foot our bill.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Let's go.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.067 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's get it.

00:39:54.067 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Get your bills going, producers.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.688 align:middle line:84%
How long would we
have to be down there?

00:39:58.688 --> 00:40:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, you'd want to
go for at least two weeks,

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.901 align:middle line:84%
I think, because it's
quite a distance to go,

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:05.234 align:middle line:90%
and the distances are very vast.

00:40:05.234 --> 00:40:06.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would we wear a big
parka and stuff like that?

00:40:06.955 --> 00:40:08.538 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We would
have to be outfitted

00:40:08.538 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:90%
with very cold weather clothes.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And then to get the permission
to go to the Kohnen base,

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I think, would be the
coup d'etat on this--

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it windy down there?

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It can be very,
very windy some days,

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.830 align:middle line:84%
but then it could also
be very temperate.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:23.170 align:middle line:90%
It just depends on the climate.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, seasons
are opposite here.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So now we're coming into
springtime in the Northern

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Hemisphere, they're
going into fall.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And the time to go is
around Christmastime

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.855 align:middle line:90%
until mid-February.

00:40:35.855 --> 00:40:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Do they have earthquakes
down there, Brad?

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.342 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, there
are fault lines,

00:40:40.342 --> 00:40:42.820 align:middle line:84%
so I would presume that there
could be earthquakes as well.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think
that huge chunks of ice

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.237 align:middle line:90%
would fall off.

00:40:46.237 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They could, yeah.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:52.690 align:middle line:84%
We went into this caldera
called Deception Island,

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's still an
active volcano.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.280 align:middle line:90%
The sand was steaming.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Had the tide not
been coming in, we

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:01.990 align:middle line:84%
could have laid down
in the hot spring

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:90%
and soaked in some hot water.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you go from
the ocean to a beach--

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Miami, California--
it's kind of flat.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It kind of just like eases
right into the beach.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.500 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
case, is it flat coming

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.380 align:middle line:84%
from the ocean to
the Antarctic Shelf?

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Or is it high, and
as you approach it,

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:27.100 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a mile high
or something like that?

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: When we were coming
across the Drake Passage,

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.500 align:middle line:84%
the first thing we saw
were the massive icebergs

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.070 align:middle line:84%
that were calving off, some as
tall as a 30-story building.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a
fraction of what's below.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So we had to take turns doing
watch to keep an eye out

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:90%
for these big icebergs.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.940 align:middle line:84%
When we did see the first
landmass of the South Shetland

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Islands, it was quite a relief
to finally see some land,

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and they just rise
very dramatically.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.440 align:middle line:84%
The West Antarctic Peninsula
that I got the opportunity

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.320 align:middle line:84%
to visit, that's a
much newer landmass.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica is actually
two landmasses that

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.730 align:middle line:90%
are combining in the middle.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:08.790 align:middle line:84%
The West Antarctic Peninsula,
the Palmer Peninsula,

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that's only 700
million years old.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Now that sounds
like a big number.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all, right?

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:15.143 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's all.

00:42:15.143 --> 00:42:19.950 align:middle line:84%
But compared to the 3 billion
year old East Antarctica plate,

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:21.733 align:middle line:90%
which is much, much older--

00:42:21.733 --> 00:42:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost as old as the
planet, for crying out loud.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, so there you
have very soft curvatures

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.690 align:middle line:84%
of the land, to
answer your question.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in West Antarctica,
very dramatic mountains

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.620 align:middle line:84%
that just rise straight
up out of the ocean,

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:84%
with glaciers coming
off either side.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Besides the reports
of a craft underneath the ice,

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:48.790 align:middle line:84%
have there been any reports
of UFO activity above?

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, there
have been quite a few.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.680 align:middle line:84%
We heard of one at the
Belgrano II Argentinean base

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.050 align:middle line:84%
the month before
we got down there.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:00.965 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
bring it up, that I

00:43:00.965 --> 00:43:02.590 align:middle line:84%
think there's some
credibility in this,

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:06.440 align:middle line:84%
is because the two researchers
that I was speaking to,

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.390 align:middle line:90%
they didn't want to tell me.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And the one woman there,
she says, no, no, no, we

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:90%
can't tell them.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.470 align:middle line:10%
She went away, and
then the other guy,

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.790 align:middle line:10%
who I spent about an hour
talking to his research--

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.650 align:middle line:10%
he was studying the ice fish
that live under the ice,

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:24.100 align:middle line:10%
a completely unique species
that lives down there--

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.100 align:middle line:10%
he finally told me
that they had seen

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.700 align:middle line:10%
some craft and orbs over
the Belgrano II Base

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.350 align:middle line:10%
the month before.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So I found that
credible because he

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:36.405 align:middle line:90%
was reluctant to talk about it.

00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:39.505 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating journey.

00:43:39.505 --> 00:43:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Thank you, George.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Always a pleasure
to talk with you.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
always traveling all

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.010 align:middle line:84%
over the planet looking
for different anomalies

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:45.980 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.930 align:middle line:84%
But for people who want
information, how do

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:48.730 align:middle line:90%
they find you?

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:49.563 align:middle line:90%
What's your website?

00:43:49.563 --> 00:43:51.438 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So if you want
to know more about me

00:43:51.438 --> 00:43:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm doing,
bradolsen.com.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:57.490 align:middle line:10%
And my publishing website
is cccpublishing.com for all

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:00.340 align:middle line:10%
the books that I publish
and some other authors under

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.015 align:middle line:10%
the CCC Publishing--

00:44:02.015 --> 00:44:03.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But going
through Brad Olsen--

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.720 align:middle line:10%
O-L-S?

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.520 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: E-N.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: E-N, not an O.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:07.665 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: I'm a "sen."

00:44:07.665 --> 00:44:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Dotcom, bradolsen.com.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Brad, thanks again for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Always a pleasure
to speak with you, George.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.847 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
to talk to somebody

00:44:14.847 --> 00:44:17.440 align:middle line:10%
who's actually been to
Antarctica looking for all

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:10%
these strange anomalies.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one day I'll make
a trip down there too.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:22.540 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.320 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.000 align:middle line:90%
