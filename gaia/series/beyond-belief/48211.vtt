00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.840 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.464 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.469 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:10%
You know, by the
end of this program,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
you are going to
make a decision about

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:10%
whether you should
take vaccines or not.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:10%
Now it's not our intention
to tell you what to do.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:10%
We want you to make
up your own mind.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:10%
Take a look.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SHERRI TENPENNY: The whole
issue of vaccine safety

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:84%
has been that we've always been
told that vaccines are safe.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But we've never really
explored the other side,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:90%
are vaccines unsafe?

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Vaccine safety
studies are short.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:90%
They're inconclusive.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't go on for
a long period of time.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:84%
All the studies are performed
on children who are not ill,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:84%
on no medications, and are,
by definition, healthy.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.280 align:middle line:84%
But once a vaccine
is approved, it's

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
being given to all children
and all adults, even

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:84%
those who have been
chronically sick

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and are on many different
types of medications.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So we really don't
know until that

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.956 align:middle line:84%
happens what the true clinical
trial is around safety.

00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our special
guest on "Beyond Belief"

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
is Dr. Sherri
Tenpenny, of course,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
from the Tenpenny
Integrative Medical Center

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:90%
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.720 align:middle line:84%
She's also a noted
author and researcher.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And Sherri, welcome.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Thank you, George.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always a
pleasure to talk to you.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Great.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was a little
boy, I hated vaccines.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Mom and dad would
bring me to the doctor,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.009 align:middle line:84%
and I knew what was
going to happen.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was running
all over the place.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:90%
They had to catch me.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.142 align:middle line:84%
I probably was pretty
smart, wasn't I?

00:01:46.142 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Absolutely.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] That's just
what I was thinking.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.323 align:middle line:90%
That was good.

00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in the '50s,
I got all those kinds

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
of vaccines that include
the simian monkey virus

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.760 align:middle line:90%
and everything else in there.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:90%
What's in my system now, Sherri?

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Prior to 1985, there
were only three vaccines.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:10%
There was the MMR,
polio, and the DPT.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.887 align:middle line:10%
Now up through 1972, we also
gave the smallpox vaccine

00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:10%
to the general population.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:10%
But that stopped in '72.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.149 align:middle line:10%
So with measles, mumps,
rubella, with polio,

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:10%
which has the simian virus in
it that you were talking about,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:10%
the contaminant that
is known to cause

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:10%
several different
types of cancers.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: The simian virus
was in the polio vaccine.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And then the DPT, which
is tetanus, diphtheria,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:90%
and pertussis.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Those were the only three that
were around up through 1985.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:84%
In 1991, there was a
big ramp-up of vaccines

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that started with the hepatitis
B vaccine, now given at birth.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And now children get 40 doses
of 16 different vaccines

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
by the time they
start kindergarten.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
There are many more
in the pipeline

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
for children who are
in middle school.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And there are about 22
more under development

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:84%
headed towards
adolescents and adults.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the
CDC will say, we're

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:90%
doing this to protect the kids.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Big pharmaceutical
companies will say,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.107 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to sell more
and more drugs and vaccines.

00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Exactly.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.237 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's correct here?

00:03:08.237 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well,
there isn't anything

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.278 align:middle line:84%
that can come through a needle
in the way of a vaccine that

00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:14.572 align:middle line:84%
can do anything to
protect your health.

00:03:14.572 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
There have been
innumerable studies

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
now that have shown that
vaccines are not safe.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:90%
They don't protect you.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:90%
And yes, they do cause harm.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these children
who get these vaccines who then

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
have side effects and
suffer consequences

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
from that, who are
then sent to a variety

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
of different specialists
for blood tests and upper

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and lower GIs and CAT scans and
all of these different things,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
are just the heavy drivers of
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And a portion of them
who get sick and have

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
chronic illnesses, with
asthma, allergies, ADD, ADHD,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:84%
seizure disorders,
cancer, Crohn's disease,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
rheumatoid arthritis,
all of these things,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:84%
then are the drivers of
the pharmaceutical industry

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:84%
because all those children
then become customers for life.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.696 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we not eradicate
polio because of vaccines?

00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: No.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
When people are
new to this topic,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
they usually start
from two places.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:90%
What about smallpox?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And what about polio?

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.470 align:middle line:84%
We know that smallpox went away
primarily because of hygiene.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It has been hypothesized that
the smallpox virus was actually

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:84%
spread by bites
from a bedbug that

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
were in straw mats in the
third world countries.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And so as they stopped
sleeping on straw mats

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and went into more cleanly
types of sleeping conditions,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and didn't have 27 people
sleeping in the same room

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
anymore, we stopped
spreading that.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we
think that smallpox

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:84%
has been eradicated because we
don't talk about it anymore,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:84%
but the virus has
actually morphed.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And there is a condition
called monkey pox that

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:90%
looks very similar to smallpox.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have monkey pox outbreaks
in Africa periodically, which

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.910 align:middle line:84%
is actually a milder
form of smallpox,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
but we can't call it that
because the CDC, of course,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:84%
says we have eradicated smallpox
since the last smallpox was

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.530 align:middle line:90%
in the United States in 1949.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And the last known case of
smallpox was in the 1980s.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are these third
world countries the areas

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
where so many of these
diseases are prevalent?

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Ebola, things like that?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to
pop out of there.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.234 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: I think it's
because of a hygiene issue.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I also think that all
those third world countries

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:84%
are actually the
experimental places

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:84%
for the pharmaceutical
industry and for the food

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.670 align:middle line:84%
industry, where Monsanto
goes in and has pesticides

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of spraying and
genetically modified food.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And so their immune
systems are much weaker.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So the viruses,
then, can pop up.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there are all
sorts of bioterrorism things

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
that are tested on people
in third world countries,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:90%
particularly in Africa.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They figure, hey,
we can get away with this.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's going to say anything.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.911 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: And nobody's
tracking anything.

00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:90%
And nobody sees anything.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And so back to your issue--
you asked me about polio.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:90%
Because that's the second part.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Polio was well on its way out,
in terms of an incident rate,

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.094 align:middle line:84%
before the polio vaccine was
actually instituted in 1954.

00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
There are many countries
around the world that

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:84%
never had a polio vaccine
that it's eradicated.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's because polio is
a gastrointestinal virus.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:84%
If you got exposed
to polio, chances

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
are what you would have
would look like the stomach

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:90%
flu or maybe food poisoning.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It would go through your
system in three to five days.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
You would have
immunity for life.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
There is only a very small
portion of people, less than 2%

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
of people, who were
exposed to the polio virus

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
that actually developed anything
that looked like paralysis.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And of that 2%, more than
90% percent of people

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.810 align:middle line:84%
had full recovery
within two years.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
But we have this whole
concept burned into our brain.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I give community
talks about polio,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.674 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say, if I
say the word polio,

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:50.673 align:middle line:84%
what's the first thing
that pops into your head?

00:06:50.673 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me?

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.881 align:middle line:90%
Iron lung.

00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Right.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.590 align:middle line:10%
Braces, kids with braces,
iron lung, paralysis.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:10%
But the truth of
the matter is, that

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:10%
happened in such a small
percentage of population.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I can't even find
statistics about it.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they even
have iron lungs anymore?

00:07:06.032 --> 00:07:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Well, they don't.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But the iron lungs were
actually the precursor

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:90%
of modern-day ventilators.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.625 align:middle line:90%
So it's not really so scary.

00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
just so big and bulky.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Right.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
technology at the time.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.682 align:middle line:84%
And now we've
evolved to what you

00:07:19.682 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
would see in an
intensive care unit, what

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
a normal, daily ventilator
would look like.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But we've got that emblazoned
into our brains for over 60

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.775 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:07:29.775 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
thing that people say.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Even two
generations away now,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
young parents today are
the same thing: braces,

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:90%
paralysis, iron lung.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:90%
60 years later.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:90%
We need to change that paradigm.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's how, you
know, I was brought up.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember seeing
a newspaper article

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:90%
in Detroit in the Detroit News.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Some little kid sitting
there in his iron lung.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, mommy,
mommy, how long

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:90%
does he have to stay in here?

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.275 align:middle line:90%
And she said, forever.

00:07:54.275 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Possibly.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.769 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it was scary then.

00:07:56.769 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: It was scary.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.809 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little kid, I'm
seven, eight years old.

00:07:59.809 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And you look at that, and you
go, wow, give me my vaccine,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.106 align:middle line:90%
please.

00:08:03.106 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: [LAUGHS]
And as they chased you

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:90%
around the doctor's office.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, so there
was a great fear factor.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Right.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To get people to
run around and get vaccines.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, we
didn't have social media

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:90%
like we have today.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So people just did what
they thought was right.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:19.940 align:middle line:90%
And it caught on.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Everybody caught on.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I remember getting the
little sugar cube later on.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh my gosh, we don't
need a vaccine anymore.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Pop it in.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.410 align:middle line:84%
But that's how
they pulled you in.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: And it's
that oral polio vaccine

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
that is still used in third
world countries today.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every time
they do something

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:84%
that's called a National
Immunization Day, an NID,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
sponsored by the World
Health Organization

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and frequently sponsored
by Rotary International,

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
because they want to
eradicate this virus.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't talk about
eradicating paralysis.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:84%
We talk about eradicating
a particular virus.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Every time we do
that, we probably

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
create somewhere around
800 cases of paralysis.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.824 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 800?

00:09:00.824 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: That's
the statistics.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Because about 2%
of the children who

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
get yet another dose of
the oral polio vaccine,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:84%
either the drops
or the sugar cube,

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
they actually
contract paralysis.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:84%
But because we
don't have any way

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.110 align:middle line:84%
to track that in
third world countries

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.804 align:middle line:84%
and India and Africa and
China, Southeast Asia,

00:09:19.804 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
many of those
children will get up

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.450 align:middle line:84%
to 20 doses of the
oral polio vaccine.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And as that becomes more
sensitized in their system,

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:90%
we are creating paralysis.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the World
Health Organization

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.962 align:middle line:84%
doesn't even track anymore
the number of cases

00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that we are actually
causing because they

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:90%
don't want people to know.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:90%
What does a parent do?

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And what are the rules
in the various school

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.332 align:middle line:90%
districts about vaccines?

00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: That's
a great question

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:84%
because that's always what
comes up with parents.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.566 align:middle line:84%
They always say, well,
I got to get them shots

00:09:49.566 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to get
them into school.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Some day when I
win the lotto, I'm

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
going to put up billboards
all across the country that

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
says, "No shots, no
school, not true."

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Every state has an
exemption policy.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:84%
The only two states that
are really difficult

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:84%
are West Virginia
and Mississippi.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:84%
The other 48 states have
a religious exemption.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are 19 states which
have a philosophical exemption,

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
which says if I don't-- I
understand that the risk

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
of the vaccine is greater
than the risk of illness.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:10%
I will take my
chances on keeping

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.080 align:middle line:10%
my child well and healthy
without injecting them

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:10%
with things that can
cause long-term harm.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So parents now,
there are many states

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to do away
with these exemptions.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
They are getting the
force of the government

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and of the pharmaceutical
industry that

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
are coming in and
saying you should not

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:90%
have a right to refuse.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:84%
We need to inoculate
your children

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
with things that can
potentially harm them.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:84%
We need to give
them these vaccines.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So in several states--
Colorado just passed a ruling

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.724 align:middle line:84%
and in Oregon and
in Washington, and I

00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:84%
think they're even doing
it in California now.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're clamping
down on parents now.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.784 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: That parents
need to go and watch

00:10:54.784 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:84%
an indoctrination
video sponsored

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.400 align:middle line:84%
by the CDC and the
government to tell them

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
that they are bad parents
if they don't vaccinate

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
their children and all
the potential problems,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:84%
that you could be killing your
child if you don't vaccinate

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:84%
However, they are never given
the other side of the story

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
about the risk of vaccines and
the long-term complications.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:90%
So it's an indoctrination.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.526 align:middle line:84%
It's a government
indoctrination policy

00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that we are now seeing that
I think is quite frightening.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.983 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and the
other part of that problem,

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
too, is states, like
Massachusetts, have passed laws

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
that they can go and take your
child away from you if they

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.470 align:middle line:84%
believe-- they believe--
that you aren't

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:90%
doing the great job as a parent.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So what's the definition
of what a great parent is?

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you beat your kid?

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you have grounds
to lose your child that way.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But if you decide you
don't want a vaccine,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:84%
does that mean
you're a bad parent?

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And can the state go in and
take the kid away from you?

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't even get a chance
to see your own child.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.974 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening
now in states.

00:11:56.974 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Yes.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the
threat that they're

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.062 align:middle line:90%
hanging over parents' heads.

00:12:02.062 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And parents that are
on Medicaid and need

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:84%
to get WIC to be able to
get food for their children,

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:90%
they have to vaccinate them.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
We have got a government
that's out of control

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:90%
with this vaccine issue now.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Not only with children
and the potential

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
of taking their child away--
which is actually more

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:90%
of a threat than a reality.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's happened
one or two times,

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:90%
but that's how government works.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
They make an example
one or two times,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.222 align:middle line:84%
and then that puts the fear
factor into other things.

00:12:26.222 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But now we are doing
things like forcing people

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.209 align:middle line:84%
to get a flu shot in
exchange for a job

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and that they have to get a flu
shot if they work at a health

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:90%
care facility.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I got a call about two
years ago from a gentleman

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
who said, "I work in the IT
department of my hospital.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.302 align:middle line:84%
I work in a building down
the street from the hospital.

00:12:44.302 --> 00:12:45.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even in the hospital.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I have no contact with
patients, and I still

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:84%
have to get a flu shot or
I'm going to lose my job."

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:84%
We're headed down a very
slippery slope there.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
If we have to get one
vaccine, a flu shot,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:84%
will the next one
be a pneumonia shot?

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Then a measles,
then chicken pox.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're
having a bad day,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.076 align:middle line:84%
so you better go
take your Prozac.

00:13:02.076 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we ought to
check your blood sugar,

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
because maybe you need your
blood sugar pill today.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Where does that stop?

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
administrators, the people

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:84%
who are force feeding this,
are they well intentioned?

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Are they misinformed?

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Are they just doing this
because they're on the take?

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.274 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:13:19.274 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: I think a little
of all of those three things.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that
they're misinformed.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are
barely a doctor, if any,

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
out there who has actually gone
so far as just read a package

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
insert to even know
what's being injected

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.480 align:middle line:90%
into an adult or children.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.840 align:middle line:84%
We talk about children a
lot, but vaccines are also

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:90%
given to adults.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I've actually given
parents, said memorize three

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
vaccine ingredients
from the package insert.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
When you take your child
in, say to the doctor,

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
can you tell me two or three
things that are in that shot.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.725 align:middle line:90%
I can assure you they can't.

00:13:49.725 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't know.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Then the
answer is, why should I

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:84%
allow you to inject
that into my child

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.204 align:middle line:84%
if you don't even
know what's in it?

00:13:55.204 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think some of
them are misinformed.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.312 align:middle line:84%
I think some of them just bought
the Kool-Aid that vaccines

00:14:00.312 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:84%
are safe, effective,
harmless, and protect you.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And they've never gone
any farther than that.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there
is a lot of money

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
to be made at the highest
ends of the vaccine

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.030 align:middle line:90%
industry, the manufacturers.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:90%
To them, it's just a widget.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.742 align:middle line:84%
It's no more than selling a
carburetor or a spark plug.

00:14:14.742 --> 00:14:16.283 align:middle line:84%
And the more of
those that they sell,

00:14:16.283 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:90%
the more money that they make.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, there's
a lot of money in it.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
When I started this,
George, back in 2000,

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
when I started all
of this research

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and putting this
information out,

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
the vaccine industry was
about a $10 billion industry.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
They are now anticipating in
2015 for it to be a $42 billion

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's just the vaccines.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Now when you look at
the vaccine industry

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:84%
as being the driver of the
rest of the health care costs,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:84%
it's why we are approaching
a trillion-dollar industry.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.509 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you involved
in this in the first place?

00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: I just started
looking at this information.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:10%
I got invited to go to the
National Vaccine Information

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.790 align:middle line:10%
Center meeting, and I
listened to all these people

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:10%
and said, how did
I not know this?

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:10%
How did I not understand that
there was a problem here?

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't vaccinated as a
child when I was growing up.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a three generations
of chiropractor family.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In those days,
they were quacks, right?

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.724 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Absolutely.

00:15:08.724 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
ones who started

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
reporting all of
the paralysis that

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
was coming with
the polio vaccine.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:90%
So I started reading CDC papers.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the next
paper and the next paper,

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and I just felt
if I read enough,

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:90%
it would finally make sense.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But now, about 18,000
hours worth of research

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
into this over nearly 14 years,
I can solidly say-- and stand

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.980 align:middle line:84%
on my own research and
reading and understanding

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:84%
of only peer-reviewed
papers, only CDC documents,

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
not conspiratology.com
and things

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
like that, the internet
is not my source,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream
medical is my source--

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:90%
that vaccines are not safe.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.500 align:middle line:84%
They've never been
proven to be effective.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:10%
And they definitely
do cause harm.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.935 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do any work at all?

00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: No.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Any of them?

00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: No.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Health does not come
through a needle.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Health is an
inside-out phenomenon.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat right,
take care of yourself,

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
do these things to
protect yourself,

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.739 align:middle line:84%
that's what really
health is all about.

00:16:06.739 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about vaccines and what

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.640 align:middle line:84%
was the theory
behind it in terms

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:84%
of how they were
supposed to work?

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.910 align:middle line:84%
You get a little bit of
the virus, the disease,

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and injected it into somebody
and let your body build up

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.250 align:middle line:90%
an immune system?

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.525 align:middle line:90%
Was that the concept?

00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: That
was the concept,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that we would just inject a
little virus into your system,

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and you would develop this
thing called an antibody.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.402 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem
with that is that when

00:16:30.402 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
you get that virus
into your system

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:84%
through an injection,
that is not the way

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:84%
the virus normally
gets into your system

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:90%
if you're going to get sick.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:84%
It comes in through your
respiratory tract or your GI

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:90%
tract.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it gets introduced
in a very abnormal method.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't engage
your entire immune system

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to take
it out of your body.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.090 align:middle line:84%
We developed this thing
called an antibody, which

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
even the conventional,
mainstream medical people say,

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.390 align:middle line:84%
"We think antibodies keep
you from getting sick,

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:90%
but we're not sure."

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's my belief
and my opinion

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that that antibody
is nothing more

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:90%
than a marker of contamination.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:84%
We have contaminated
the immune system,

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
the immune system developed this
antibody to try to glob onto it

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of it.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.592 align:middle line:84%
But just because
you have an antibody

00:17:12.592 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:84%
doesn't keep you
from getting sick.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
And there are many documented
cases now and reports

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.943 align:middle line:84%
of people who have adequate
antibody, what they call

00:17:19.943 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
protective antibody, and
they get sick anyway.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:22.494 align:middle line:90%
Even tetanus.

00:17:22.494 --> 00:17:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: There are
many cases of people

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
who have high levels
of tetanus antibodies,

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and they've still
gotten tetanus.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:84%
The CDC does a report
every two years or so

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
about the number of cases
of tetanus in this country.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And there are always somewhere
between 120 and 150 cases out

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:90%
of 300 million people.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And of those people,
somewhere between 16% and 20%

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
of people who get
full blown tetanus

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
have had four or
more tetanus shots.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So does the tetanus
shot protect you?

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Does the antibody protect you?

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a marker
of contamination.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.939 align:middle line:84%
It does nothing to keep
you from getting sick.

00:17:57.939 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sherri,
during my Navy days,

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I had to get the series of
shots, including a cholera

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:90%
shot.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And I never went to any
region that had cholera,

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:90%
but you had to get that.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you, that night
my arm swelled up so big,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.977 align:middle line:84%
and I had to play a
softball game the next day.

00:18:16.977 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Oh gosh.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was horrible.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Yeah.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, vaccine side effects
can range from anything

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:84%
from a sore, swollen
arm up to a death.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
anywhere along the way.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.330 align:middle line:90%
It can be high-pitched fevers.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It can be development
of autoimmune disease,

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:37.500 align:middle line:84%
neurological diseases,
autoimmune diseases like lupus,

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Crohn's disease,
asthma, allergies,

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
a whole long list of side
effects and complications.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
problems, in my opinion,

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
is that if you have a death or
a really serious complication,

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.127 align:middle line:90%
you can't sue the government.

00:18:52.127 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
You can't sue the doctor
who gave it to you.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.032 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:90%
They're immune from that.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: You can't sue
the manufacturing industry.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through
what's called the Vaccine

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Court, through the
Federal Court of Claims,

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and have somebody, who
is a non-doctor, called

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:84%
a special master, decide whether
or not that vaccine really made

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.950 align:middle line:84%
you sick and really
caused your problem.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And so they look
at the evidence,

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and if they decide that
it didn't, then you're

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:90%
just out of luck.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's what
the vaccine does, then.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
It makes them
immune to law suits.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.319 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: [LAUGHS]
I guess it does.

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: See?

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:90%
It does work.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: And immune to logic.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a doctor
who had a flu shot who

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.974 align:middle line:90%
came down with some syndrome.

00:19:26.974 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Guilliain-Barre.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:90%
France

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Guillain-Barre.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It affected him.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:90%
He just didn't act right.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It affects your nervous
system or something, right?

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:36.963 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: It does.

00:19:36.963 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
It causes an
autoimmune reaction,

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
which means your body turns
on itself to your spinal cord

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:90%
and your peripheral nerves.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:84%
That's called
Guillain-Barre syndrome.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.284 align:middle line:84%
We know that that happens,
not only in flu shots,

00:19:48.284 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:84%
but it can happen
in tetanus shots

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and just about any other
vaccine can have that.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What causes that?

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: It's this whole
disruption, this whole chain

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.830 align:middle line:84%
reaction, of what
happens when you

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle line:84%
inject these things
into your system.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
You develop an
autoimmune response.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And the autoimmune response
can be to neurologic tissue,

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
to lung tissue, to GI
tissue, to heart tissue.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:10%
It could be to wherever
that immune response happens

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:10%
to click in based on a principle
called molecular mimicry, which

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:10%
means--

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:17.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: God, that's scary.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: It's very scary.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.031 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean, you
go in, you're healthy.

00:20:20.031 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:90%
You get an injection.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:90%
And you get sick.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well, the
Gardisil vaccine--

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.230 align:middle line:84%
now we have at least
120 confirmed deaths

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:90%
from that vaccine.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.170 align:middle line:84%
The Gardisil vaccine is the
vaccine given to young girls

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:84%
to keep them from
getting cervical cancer.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But in the last two years,
they're now also giving it

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.914 align:middle line:84%
to young boys because it's
these dirty little boys that

00:20:40.914 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:90%
spread that virus, you know.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're the ones.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: They're the ones.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And there have been 15,
20 deaths among the boys

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.535 align:middle line:84%
that we've just started and at
least 120, maybe more by now--

00:20:51.535 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From this vaccine.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.909 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: From this vaccine.

00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So you've got young girls that
are somewhere between 9 and 15

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:84%
who are getting this shot, who
were athletes, cheerleaders,

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.741 align:middle line:90%
prom queens, musicians.

00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's sad.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: And now
they are either dead

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.640 align:middle line:84%
or they're sitting in a
chair, completely debilitated

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and have no life in the
future, over a vaccine

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:90%
that's completely unnecessary.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a parent who
wants to do the right thing.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
This has got to be a
horrible decision for them.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:10%
Because they're
bombarded on one end

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:10%
from the media, from
doctors, from pharmacies,

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:10%
from pharmaceutical companies:
vaccination, vaccination,

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:10%
vaccination.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:10%
And you don't want to
screw up your child's life.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to
think, oh my God.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:10%
I made a mistake.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:10%
I didn't get the vaccine.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:10%
What have I done to my child?

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:90%
What does a poor parent do?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well, I always
tell parents that when

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.450 align:middle line:84%
you choose to have children, you
sign up for some level of risk.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.152 align:middle line:90%
Kids don't come with a manual.

00:21:56.152 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It ain't easy.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: [LAUGHS] And
there are some levels of risk,

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:84%
like for example, when your
kids go out and ride a bike.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:90%
You have them wear a helmet.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You teach them how to
swim, so that cuts down

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:90%
the chance of them drowning.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:84%
There are things that you
do to mitigate those risks.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the vaccinations,

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
you say, well, if
I don't vaccinate,

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.100 align:middle line:84%
what can I do to keep
my child healthy?

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I can feed them good food,
get them to bed on time,

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:84%
make them take vitamins,
love them a lot,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.790 align:middle line:84%
because we know what love
does to the immune system.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
things I can do

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to keep my child from getting
sick, Vitamin D, vitamin

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:90%
C, all sorts of things.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:84%
When I choose to
vaccinate, the risk of that

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
is completely unknown,
and you can't unvaccinate.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So when you inject something
into the body, you as a parent

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.080 align:middle line:84%
lose all control
over that outcome.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
That outcome can be
anything, as we've

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:84%
said, from a sore
arm to a death.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot predict
that in advance.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So when you weigh
those risks, these

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:84%
are things I can do to
keep my child healthy,

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I lose total control when
I decide to vaccinate.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And why are we so afraid of
a cough, a fever, and a rash?

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Which is what pertussis,
measles, mumps, rubella,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:84%
chickenpox, all
those things are.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.126 align:middle line:90%
A cough, a fever, and a rash.

00:23:13.126 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And if they were so
deadly, George, you and I

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.509 align:middle line:84%
would no longer be here, because
anybody over the age of 50

00:23:17.509 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:90%
would just be gone.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:18.941 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: So I think
that parents need to look

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:84%
at mitigating risk and what
they can control and what they

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:90%
can't.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's much
more safe to err

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
on the side of not
vaccinating and keeping them

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
healthy than to inject
them with something that

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
can cause them a
lifetime of bad health.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you debate people
from the medical side often?

00:23:39.615 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: No.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's only because
they won't debate me.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're afraid.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: I've
actually volunteered.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to talk to
many of the big wigs

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
in the pro-vaccine industry, and
they won't take on the debate.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And their argument is, from the
CDC is that if we debate it,

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.390 align:middle line:84%
then we give credence to the
fact that there's a debate.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And in their mind,
there is no debate.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:84%
You vaccinate, vaccinate,
vaccinate, vaccinate.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's no other way
around it except to vaccinate.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The people
who are creating

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:84%
these vaccines, the
researchers-- not

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:84%
the companies, but
the researchers-- I

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.642 align:middle line:90%
assume they're well intentioned.

00:24:13.642 --> 00:24:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: I think so.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, they've
bought the Kool-Aid.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And they really
believe that a vaccine

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:84%
can eradicate an
infection, which

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
we need to stop calling
these things diseases.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.881 align:middle line:90%
They're infections.

00:24:23.881 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They come and go just
like the flu or a cold.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
If they can eradicate
that, then why

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:90%
isn't that a little bit better?

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
They give no
recognition whatsoever

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
to what that injection
can do in terms

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.300 align:middle line:90%
of causing other side effects.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of money in it.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you develop a
vaccine that comes to market,

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.010 align:middle line:84%
we're talking hundreds of
millions of dollars, maybe even

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:84%
billions of dollars if you
get that instituted worldwide.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.659 align:middle line:84%
So I guess people
who are inventors

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:50.700 align:middle line:84%
are probably well intentioned,
but there's always

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:90%
an economic driver.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.148 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
guess the person who

00:24:53.148 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
creates it gets
his bonus, right?

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: His bonus.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Either he gets the money or
he gets his names up in lights

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.960 align:middle line:90%
or whatever makes him famous.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's always a driver.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are other
nations, not third world,

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.540 align:middle line:84%
but other nations,
doing about vaccines?

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Every country
has a vaccination policy.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Most of Western Europe,
South America, all of them

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:90%
have a vaccination policy.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But we are the only
country that has mandates.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:84%
We are the only
country that forcibly

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.570 align:middle line:84%
has these kids get injections
before they come to school.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
The other countries,
they offer them,

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that doctors are
much more lenient about, well,

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:90%
you know, your child has asthma.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.020 align:middle line:90%
He's sick, he has a fever.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.547 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we shouldn't
do this today.

00:25:33.547 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I know that in some
countries, they actually

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.260 align:middle line:84%
even do skin testing
with the vaccine

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:84%
to see if the child's
going to react

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.832 align:middle line:84%
to any of those litany of
ingredients that are in there.

00:25:41.832 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like those
allergy tests .

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:43.998 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Yeah.

00:25:43.998 --> 00:25:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And if they create a
big wheal, it gets red,

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:84%
then it's like, well,
your child would probably

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:90%
react badly to this.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.495 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to give it.

00:25:49.495 --> 00:25:50.992 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that here.

00:25:50.992 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that we don't do is

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.260 align:middle line:84%
that when you give the first
shot, then the second shot,

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and the third shot, they
are given in a series,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
ostensibly because
not everybody is

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
going to develop that
antibody that we talked about.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So we give it three times,
because the first one

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:90%
creates a little reaction.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
a larger reaction.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:10.840 align:middle line:90%
And then the third one--

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
the booster, right?

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Right.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And that booster
on that third one

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:84%
can sometimes put
those antibody levels

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.235 align:middle line:84%
in a child up into the tens
of thousands of levels.

00:26:19.235 --> 00:26:20.110 align:middle line:90%
They don't need that.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's risky and high.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: It's very
risky and very high.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have the
economics in our system

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
to test each child
after one shot to say,

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.140 align:middle line:90%
do you have enough antibody?

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Is it good enough for us
in the way we define it?

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a one size fits all policy.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.380 align:middle line:84%
All the children,
all the adults,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:84%
get all the vaccines
on a certain schedule

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.460 align:middle line:90%
without exception.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They give the
whooping cough vaccine,

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:90%
but it's still around.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:90%
They haven't eradicated that.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Yeah, and there's
been a lot of discussion

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:84%
about that in the past
couple of years, too.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
scratching their head.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.210 align:middle line:90%
They don't know why that is.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Part of it, I believe, it's
because that vaccine was

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
developed in 1940s,
and the bacteria

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:84%
has morphed and changed out
there in the environment.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.633 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's smart.

00:27:01.633 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: And in fact,
the pertussis bacteria,

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.800 align:middle line:84%
which is what causes--
the spore of that

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.720 align:middle line:84%
is what causes the
whooping cough.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Now they're saying that
most of the cases of that we

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:84%
see in kids that we would
define them or diagnose

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:84%
with whooping cough is
not caused by pertussis.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It's caused by another
bacteria called parapertussis.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.846 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:27:22.846 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a vaccine in
development for that one, too.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:25.761 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, great.

00:27:25.761 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long are
these vaccines at trial

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.800 align:middle line:90%
before they come to marketplace?

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: That can vary.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:84%
That can vary anywhere
from 4 to 20 years.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, sometimes--

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.491 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long.

00:27:37.491 --> 00:27:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: They've been trying
to develop a new flu shot being

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.890 align:middle line:84%
made from this, what's
called a cell line.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And several times--
Baxter's brought

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.040 align:middle line:90%
this to market several times.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.136 align:middle line:84%
And it's been so
reactive and causing

00:27:49.136 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:84%
so much fever and so
many side effects,

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.910 align:middle line:90%
they've taken it off the market.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.868 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: There's
another vaccine

00:27:53.868 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
called ProQuad, which is
measles, mumps, rubella,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:90%
and chickenpox all in one shot.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:84%
They've had that one
on and off the market

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe about three times
because it causes so many side

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:90%
But they keep trying it.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They keep trying
to bring it back.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hear measles
are coming back.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Oh, you
know, George, we

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.360 align:middle line:90%
have 40 cases of measles.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.205 align:middle line:84%
And we've got the
media in an uproar.

00:28:13.205 --> 00:28:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, my god,
it's all this--

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's over!

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: It's all
those unvaccinated--

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ebola's coming here!

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.966 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: [LAUGHS] It's all
those unvaccinated kids that

00:28:19.966 --> 00:28:23.750 align:middle line:84%
are causing these
epidemics to come back

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.410 align:middle line:90%
of these eradicate diseases.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:26.290 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can have tens of
thousands of side effects.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every year, there
are 12,000 vaccine reactions

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
reported to the CDC,
at least 12,000.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And they believe
that's only 10%.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.710 align:middle line:90%
So we have all these reactions.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever hear anything
about that in the news?

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
But we have 40 cases of
measles or 20 cases of mumps

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.654 align:middle line:84%
or 50 cases of pertussis--
oh my gosh, it's horrible.

00:28:50.654 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a travesty.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a pandemic.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: It's a pandemic.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of all those
unvaccinated kids; however,

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
when they peel back
the onion, they

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:84%
find out that all of those
kids who've ended up sick,

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:84%
like the mumps outbreak
that they're having right

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.920 align:middle line:84%
now at Ohio State, all of those
kids have had at least one,

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:90%
usually two, mumps vaccines.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the fact that I
had the measles, and the mumps,

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.342 align:middle line:84%
and all that when I was
a kid, I'm immune now?

00:29:18.342 --> 00:29:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well,
what happens when

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:84%
you have a natural infection
is that your immune system has

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:90%
two arms.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as kind
of like a teeter totter.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:90%
And one arm's called TH1.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:90%
And the other arm's called TH2.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you actually
have a real infection,

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:90%
you engage both sides.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.580 align:middle line:84%
That teeter totter
goes back and forth

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and activates into
a long-term immunity

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:84%
because you've had
fever, and you've

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:84%
engaged cytokines and
all these different parts

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.510 align:middle line:84%
of your immune system so that
now you have a real immunity.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.960 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
vaccine, you only

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.970 align:middle line:90%
have a TH2 side, no TH1 side.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:90%
So you have a false immunity.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this
stuff all goes away.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why
people who have actually

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.170 align:middle line:10%
had these infections,
like you-- I

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:10%
had measles, mumps, rubella,
chickenpox, pertussis,

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:10%
all these things
when I was a kid.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's one of the
reasons why we're possibly

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.396 align:middle line:10%
so healthy today.

00:30:08.396 --> 00:30:10.270 align:middle line:10%
Plus, I think we take
good care of ourselves.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:10%
We like to take
vitamins and supplements

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:10%
and eat right and exercise.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:10%
And that's what it
takes to be healthy.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Health does not come
through a needle.

>>TENPENNY: Thank
you so much, George.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, we're
not here to tell

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:10%
you to get vaccines or not.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.020 align:middle line:10%
You make up your own mind.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:10%
You get the information,
and you decide.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:30.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.330 align:middle line:10%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
