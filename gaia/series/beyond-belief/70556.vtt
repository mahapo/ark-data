00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.011 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:10.636 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:13.944 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.185 align:middle line:84%
We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.532 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure if you've
come across somebody

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:10%
who has been
possessed, somebody who

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:10%
has been attacked by a demon.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But it is, trust me, one of
the most scariest, frightening

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:90%
feelings that you can imagine.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Bill Bean is a
spiritual warrior.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:90%
He's a minister.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:90%
He's an exorcist.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:90%
And he faces this every day.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:84%
In our earlier edition
of "Beyond Belief," Bill,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
you talked about your
family upbringing

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and what you went through,
and truly it was horrendous.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
How did you end up
pulling yourself together

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
to be where you are today as
a minister, as an exorcist,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.891 align:middle line:90%
as a spiritual warrior?

00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL BEAN: It's a miraculous
transformation, George.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.610 align:middle line:90%
There's no other way to say it.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
For so many years I was
empty, faithless, hopeless,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:90%
lived in darkness.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wandering around.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Wandering around in a
great deal of pain and despair,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:90%
seeking death.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:10%
But yet God had another
plan for my life,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:10%
and it took many years for
it to manifest and unfold,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.700 align:middle line:10%
because I was so, I
guess, unruly in my ways

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:10%
and just couldn't
tune in to what

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:10%
God was trying to provide
for me or the path

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:10%
that he was trying
to lead me down.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a
gradual transformation.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Now God gives us all
free will, so we're

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:90%
free to make our choices.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I
made the conscious effort

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and decision that
hey, I can do better.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:90%
I can be better.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.167 align:middle line:84%
I can have some
happiness in my life.

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you hit the bottom?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Oh absolutely,
I hit the bottom, yes.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And even after the passing of my
beloved mother and grandmother,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that caused such pain for
me and I was so young.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I had quit school and
lied about my age,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
so I left school in
the eighth grade.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that affected me to where
I felt like oh, I'm uneducated.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
For many years I wanted
to tell the story,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:84%
but I felt intellectually
inadequate,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that I could not properly
present the story.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So it held me back
for so long, and then

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I made that decision that hey,
I'm going to educate myself.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And knowledge is power, George.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And I started to study anything
and everything that I could.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
It was like God had
flipped a switch for me,

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
my mind was a sponge,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and I started studying
and absorbing things.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that really catapulted me
in this transformation process.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I
just said to God one day,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:90%
I make you first in my life.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:90%
I want you to guide my life.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I thank you for my life.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I accept your salvation
through your son,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeshua, Jesus the Christ.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:90%
And I got baptized.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I got
baptized together.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.677 align:middle line:90%
It was the greatest day.

00:03:16.677 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a turnaround

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: George, it
was the greatest day.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my life
truly had come full circle,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and that God had put
that calling on me.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
decide, or at what point

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
did you decide to become a
spiritual warrior to help

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
people from all these demonic
forces that are out there?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well first of
all, I didn't want it,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:84%
because even before getting
baptized-- I wasn't baptized

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
until 2008, so I started doing
the interviews-- Discovery

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Channel, a haunting series aired
my episode September 7, 2006.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And after that, well, I
became a public figure then.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I was getting contacted by
people from all over the world.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
people were in need,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
so I would refer them
to people that I knew.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I had no intention
of going into this

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.155 align:middle line:90%
and getting my hands dirty.

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These were
just experiences

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:90%
that you'd gone through.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh yes.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing all the
shows, and the interviews,

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was on
"Coast to Coast,"

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I was still having some
problems from the enemy.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, many show hosts
would line up and say, hey,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.516 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you what happened
while I was interviewing him

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:90%
on my show.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:90%
They were hearing voices.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
They were seeing
manifestations in their studios

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:90%
while interviewing me.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until I got
baptized that it all stopped

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:90%
and then it all changed.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And once that took
place, God put

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.986 align:middle line:84%
that calling on my life,
which I very much resisted.

00:04:35.986 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, did
you just wake up one day

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:90%
and say I've got to do this?

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: No, because right
after being baptized--

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.181 align:middle line:84%
I mean right after-- I felt
this huge calling in my spirit--

00:04:47.181 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you had never
been baptized before?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: No.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt that I
needed to help people.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
God was telling
me that I could be

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
hands on in helping
these people.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And it took a while
though, George.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And so finally I couldn't
resist it anymore,

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and I went and started
helping these people,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:90%
going in spiritual warfare.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.420 align:middle line:90%
And now here I am today.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So this has been going on now
since, I'd say, probably 2009.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you how
many people all over America

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:84%
that God has worked through
me to free from evil,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
else that I'd rather

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.902 align:middle line:90%
be doing with my life.

00:05:23.902 --> 00:05:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a lot
of evil out there, Bill.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: A lot.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:90%
And I will tell you this.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.666 align:middle line:84%
Without truly
knowing the answer,

00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
what I feel about this.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.726 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:33.726 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I feel there
are certain things going

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:84%
on in the world that is--
let me say it this way.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:84%
There are forces
on the Earth that

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
don't have the best
interest of mankind.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:84%
They are in league
with demonic forces.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.774 align:middle line:84%
They are of the very
seed line of Satan.

00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always were, right?

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes, yes.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And they are causing things
to happen on this Earth,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and I think such things as the
harp device that is opening up

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:84%
these giant sinkholes
all over the Earth.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I feel that's some portals
are opening and releasing

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.320 align:middle line:90%
more demons onto the Earth.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm telling you,
George, at this point in time,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.270 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to just last year,
the number of demonic cases

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:90%
that I've dealt with--

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Huge.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Huge increase.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something's
happening to people.

00:06:27.168 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Something is
a really happening.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People are scared.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:90%
They're not acting right.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're uptight.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:90%
They're angry.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
being bombarded.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about demonic
forces, what are they?

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Is that a natural process
of what's in the universe?

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Or were they created after
goodness was created?

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Biblically
speaking, we see

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:84%
that Yahweh created Satan
as this great angel that

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.980 align:middle line:90%
had pipes in him.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh created
pipes in him, and he

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
was the-- I guess we would
call him the choir director

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:84%
He was in charge of the praise
and worship music for God.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And so he was this
beautiful adorned angel,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:90%
and then suddenly he rebelled.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He turned.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: He turned.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And so Yahweh cast him out
with a third of the angels out

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:84%
of heaven, and they came down
here and took human women

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and produced a hybrid
offspring called the nephilim.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that this
is where it all began.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And then that seed line
just goes right on through.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.619 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there are demonic
humans from that seed line.

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: I certainly believe it.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore if we go
back to Genesis 3, 13 and 15

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
where God has called Adam,
Eve and the serpent together.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And he says what have
you done with the woman?

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
done this, I will

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
create enmity--
which means hatred--

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:90%
between you and the woman.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And I will create
enmity, hatred,

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.172 align:middle line:84%
between your seed
and the woman seed.

00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So could Hitler
have been one of them?

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: It is quite possible.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
the answer to this.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you this,
I go by discernment.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
God could-- he
could give all of us

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:84%
discernment when we have
that connection with him.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:84%
In these demonic cases, before
I even go into the home,

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:84%
once I had arrived
at the residence,

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%
God will start to put
a mental picture--

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and I don't claim to be a
psychic or anything else--

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.359 align:middle line:84%
he puts a mental
picture in my head,

00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:41.567 align:middle line:84%
and I start to develop a knowing
of what's going on in there

00:08:41.567 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:90%
and what I'm dealing with.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a gift.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic church,
Bill, has about 120

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
practicing exorcists out
there roaming the planet,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:90%
trying to do what they do.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:90%
You perform exorcisms as well.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Take us through one.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what do
you do when you-- I

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.870 align:middle line:90%
mean, how are you contacted?

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:90%
What do they ask you?

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.757 align:middle line:84%
And what do you see
once you get there?

00:09:03.757 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Yeah, it's amazing
because, again, there's

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.798 align:middle line:90%
so many people in need.

00:09:06.798 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And most of these people
contact me via email,

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:84%
although some do have my
number from other people

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.676 align:middle line:90%
that I've helped.

00:09:13.676 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So I have a waiting
list, George.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
There is a waiting
list of people.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You travel
all over the country.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.128 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: All over the country.

00:09:19.128 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Every weekend I'm travelling.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I do is I
have a discussion with them

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and they start telling me
things that are going on,

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and some will try
and send me pictures.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll say look, you're
telling me now.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm really not interested
in seeing the pictures,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.470 align:middle line:84%
because I'll rely on God to
give me everything that I need.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You get
your own pictures.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:37.721 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yeah.

00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm really not interested in
seeing that, because again,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:84%
just talking with
someone you could

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:84%
start to feel what's
going on here.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So then I will get
to the residence,

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.839 align:middle line:84%
and before I even get
out of the vehicle--

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feel it.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.254 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I could
not only feel it,

00:09:55.254 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
but God is starting to
unfold things in my mind.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that because of
maybe your experience as a boy?

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I believe so, to where
he's put this calling on me.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, I could not be
here had I not been there.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So in a strange way,
God allowed those things

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.322 align:middle line:90%
to happen as a preparation--

00:10:09.322 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For you.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: For where
I'm at right now.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:90%
So I will say--

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.926 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At the unfortunate
sacrifice of your family.

00:10:15.926 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Unfortunately, yes.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Do I wish I could change it?

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
If I could go back in time,
if I had a time machine

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.462 align:middle line:84%
and could go back in time, I
absolutely would change it,

00:10:24.462 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
especially when it comes to
the suffering of my mother, who

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.378 align:middle line:84%
suffered more than
any other person

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:29.554 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen in my life.

00:10:29.554 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Certainly I would go
back and change it,

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:90%
but I can't change it.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
This is part of where I'm at
now in moving forward in life.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I regret that all
those things happened.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
I wish they hadn't
happened, but now it's

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:90%
part of my journey in life.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that you get that
call, let's say, from a family

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:90%
in Wichita.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.394 align:middle line:90%
You go there?

00:10:48.394 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh absolutely.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then what happens?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: The first thing is
when I arrive at the residence,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.585 align:middle line:84%
God starts to put this
mental picture in my head

00:10:56.585 --> 00:10:58.460 align:middle line:84%
so I'm starting to get
a understanding what's

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:90%
going on here.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, George,
unfortunately sexual abuse

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
is at the root of a
lot of these problems.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So I will say a prayer
outside in Hebrew.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.745 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking Yahweh to
bring his giant warrior

00:11:10.745 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:84%
angels to come and to carry
off these demonic forces,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
to work through me to bind
them and cast them out.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a short prayer?

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.022 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:11:18.022 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want to do it,
just so we know what it's like?

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Yeah, so
what I would say

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.330 align:middle line:84%
is, again, I'm just
calling on Yahweh,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
so Yahweh Elohim, Yahweh
Elohim, Yahweh Elohim.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Or you could say Adonai
Sabaoth , Adonai Sabaoth,

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Adonai Sabaoth.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing
that we're doing

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
is it comes up to where you're
saying holy, holy, holy.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're calling
on God and we're

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:84%
asking him to bring
his giant warrior

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
angels to come in and carry
these demonic forces off,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.734 align:middle line:84%
to work through me to bind
them and cast them out.

00:11:49.734 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
outside the house.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So then I've anointed
my head with oil.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.891 align:middle line:84%
And I use a combination of holy
oil, holy water, and holy salt.

00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been
afraid to go in the house?

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Never once.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you why.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Because as a deliverance
minister, as an agent for God,

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.520 align:middle line:84%
as an extension for God, I
have to be in total faith.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.189 align:middle line:84%
If my faith waivers
for one second at all--

00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shattered.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: It's over.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:90%
So I have to be--

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
useless to them.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.153 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Right.

00:12:21.153 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So I have to be in
warrior mode 24/7.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.065 align:middle line:84%
I know that's easier
said than done.

00:12:26.065 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
to exhaust you.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: It does get
exhausting sometimes.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So when I go into the house,
I will say the Lord's Prayer

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:90%
at the door.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you can feel this?

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh yes.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:90%
By that time I know.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a picture
what's going on.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So then I'll say house blessing
prayer right at the front door.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I anoint the family's heads
with oil and then we sit down.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.779 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now are you exorcising
the house, the family, or both?

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Both.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a
process, George.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:90%
You have to clean everything.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So then I sit down
with the family

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:90%
and I become a counselor.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these
talks are hours.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere from two to six
hours of sitting down.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I have to dig.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I want
to know everybody's

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:90%
deep and dark secrets.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I have to know them,
because we have

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.064 align:middle line:84%
to get to the root of what is
going on here, because Satan--

00:13:12.064 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
honest with you?

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's a process
there, too, and let

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
me say this, Satan
and his minions,

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:90%
they deal in legalities.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.547 align:middle line:84%
So if they feel they have
a legal right to be there,

00:13:25.547 --> 00:13:26.630 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be there.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So I have to dig into this
person's personal life

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.741 align:middle line:84%
to find out what
that legal hold is.

00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I have
to assume while you're

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:84%
doing this, while they're
sharing you information,

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:90%
the demons are in this house.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.232 align:middle line:84%
They've got to be fit
to be tied, literally.

00:13:43.232 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: No question about it.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they come at you?

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: No, they have
to flee my presence.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you why.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not me.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not my power.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It's God's power that works
through me, which is so strong,

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
George, that it
repels these things.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can't get to you.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.056 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: They have no choice.

00:13:57.056 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:90%
And I praise God for that.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Again, it is not my power.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't claim to be
anything or anybody, just

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
a warrior for God, a
humble servant for God

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that God works through
to help other people.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's sitting down with these
people, it's gut wrenching.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So after
this two to five,

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:84%
six hour meeting with them, you
get the information you need,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:90%
then what do you do?

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Once I have the
information that I need--

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and this is part of
the purging process.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you and I, we're
sitting and you tell me

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.290 align:middle line:84%
all your deepest, darkest
junk, and we all have it

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
for many years of
whatever it may be.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a purging process,
because the people are

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.034 align:middle line:90%
getting it up, and out, and off.

00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:39.324 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they crying when
they're telling you this?

00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Oh yes, and
it's heartbreaking.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.140 align:middle line:90%
It's gut wrenching.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Especially when it comes to
the sexual abuse of-- some

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.410 align:middle line:84%
of these people had been
sexually abused from childhood.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they abused by the
family member who's in there?

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Some.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a gut
wrenching process.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to get this
stuff up, and out, and off.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of
the transformation.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So then I'll take
a person's hand.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll say take my hand-- and
again, this is not my power.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
This is God's power
working through me.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say to them I want
you to close your eyes.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I want you to imagine
yourself in total darkness.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to manifest
every single horrible thing

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
you could imagine in your life
that you've ever experienced.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I want you to manifest it
all in your mind right now.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
So I give them a second,
and I'll say do you see it?

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say yes.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:90%
I'll say now--

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they generally
pick the worst moment?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.799 align:middle line:90%
Or everything?

00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: They're picking
everything that they can.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.881 align:middle line:84%
These people, they're
trying to-- and I want them

00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:45.787 align:middle line:84%
to, because I want
them to get it all--

00:15:45.787 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get it out.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Get it out.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.215 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: So then
I say, I want you

00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
to see this
magnificent light that

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.480 align:middle line:84%
is now swallowing
that darkness up.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I give them-- I'll
say, now, do you see it?

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And they're saying yes.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.089 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is part
of the exorcism process?

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And so then I say, OK, there's a
figure emerging from the light.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
In his right hand he's
holding a window that is open.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it?

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say yes.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say OK, he's standing
right in front of you.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take every
one of those horrific events

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and problems that
you have manifested,

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to see
yourself balling it up

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
into one gigantic,
ugly, black beach ball.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say I want you to
see yourself creating it.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say OK.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So then I'll say on
the count of three

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see
yourself kicking

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
that ball through that
open window as hard

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:90%
as you possibly can.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And don't miss.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Yes, so we'll go through
the one, two, and then three.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Bang.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.329 align:middle line:84%
So I say OK-- now
you can see and feel

00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:90%
the relief of the person.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say OK, the one who
is holding that open window is

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:84%
none other than Yeshua,
Jesus the Christ.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to receive
the power of God in your body

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to feel
it starting at your feet,

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to
feel it filling you

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:90%
to the top of your head.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is a process, George--

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their eyes are closed?

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a process to where--
literally like an oil change.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I call it a
spiritual oil change.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It is literally flushing out
all the gunk and the garbage

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:84%
that the enemy has built
up for all these years.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And now God's power
is replenishing it.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So it forces it to
the top of the head,

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.747 align:middle line:84%
and as crazy as this might
sound to you or the viewers,

00:17:39.747 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:84%
once it gets to the top of
the head-- and I'll say that.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
I want you to let
me know when this

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:90%
gets to the top of your head.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:90%
And they say OK.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.382 align:middle line:84%
So then I go over to
the person's head,

00:17:51.382 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:90%
and I literally--

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:53.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You touch them?

00:17:53.195 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: No, not touch them.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:01.359 align:middle line:84%
I literally grab that
entity that has manifested--

00:18:01.359 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Near their head?

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Literally pull
it out of their head.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Demonstrate.

00:18:04.135 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: So I would
come over to your head,

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and I would literally
pull it out like that,

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:84%
then I go to the front
door, I walk outside,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.762 align:middle line:84%
and I ask God's angels to
come and carry this thing off.

00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get rid of it.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.412 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't just bind
it and cast it out,

00:18:21.412 --> 00:18:23.036 align:middle line:84%
because we got to be
careful with that.

00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
instant relief?

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Or has there ever been a
time where it didn't work?

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well, there has
been times that it's worked.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
But there's also been times
to where someone fell back

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
into some things to
where I had to go back.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.136 align:middle line:90%
So that happens.

00:18:37.136 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Couple days later?

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.343 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Couple days later.

00:18:39.343 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Couple weeks later.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.195 align:middle line:90%
Couple months.

00:18:41.195 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spirit comes back?

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:90%
The evil spirit?

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:10%
>>BEAN: It comes back, because
we have to be very careful,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.140 align:middle line:10%
George.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:10%
When these things
take place, we have

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:10%
to be very careful to keep
certain doorways closed

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:51.935 align:middle line:10%
to the enemy.

00:18:51.935 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And if that doorway opens
back up, well guess what?

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
They're coming, and seven more
wicked are coming with it.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
So this person finds
himself in a worse place

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:90%
than they were originally.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
wondered, Bill,

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:06.330 align:middle line:84%
if people bring this
onto themselves.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I will say some do
by dabbling into some things.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And some unwittingly do, because
we're saturated as a society.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:90%
As a people we are saturated.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Satan is the prince and
the power of the air

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and I believe the
airwaves as well,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and there is some
programming, whether it

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
be through TV, or music,
entertainment industry, movies,

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:84%
whatever it may be, there
are certain things that

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:84%
are presented in that way that
is really mind programming

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and has the capacity and
propensity-- these demons have

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.300 align:middle line:84%
that to travel--
literally travel through,

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:84%
because I believe some of these
things are portals as well.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember movie
The Green Mile with Tom Hanks?

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And John Coffey who
would release evil from people,

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:90%
but he would have to absorb it.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.004 align:middle line:90%
He would take it in.

00:19:59.004 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Exactly.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would come
down in his mouth.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Does that happen to
you sometimes where

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.155 align:middle line:84%
this evil that you
released goes into you,

00:20:10.155 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
even if it's just
for a short moment.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.044 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: No, and I thank
God for that, because--

00:20:15.044 --> 00:20:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would get you.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Yeah, I bind
and rebuke that.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I won't have any part of that.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So part of this purging
for the individual

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
is to pull this out
of them, and then I

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%
release it to God and his mighty
giant warrior angels that come.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'm literally handing
this thing off to them,

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and then I go through the
entire house, the entire house,

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and I bless, seal,
sanctify, purify,

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and cleanse, and make
holy the entire home.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll even go into
closets and everything.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're always
in closets, aren't they?

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I go to the
outside of the house,

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to bless and
seal the outside of the home

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you one
exorcism that I recently

00:20:55.230 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
performed in Gettysburg was
just absolutely one of the most

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
intense that I've
ever been involved in.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: To make a long
story short, this lady, who

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:84%
has become a very
dear friend of mine,

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:84%
she was suffering greatly
for many, many years.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And after performing
the exorcism,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I went through the
entire house, which

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
is a very large
house in Gettysburg,

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.364 align:middle line:84%
and in the attic-- which
was one of those walk

00:21:27.364 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
through type of attics that
you could make an office

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:84%
or whatever out of--
went through there.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And I sensed the presence
of evil up there.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was back
in a dark corner.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hiding?

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So I said by the
mighty power of Yahweh

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
in Jesus' name I bind you and I
command you to depart at once.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you screaming?

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: In a very authoritative
voice, absolutely.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And so then I threw the
holy water-- the oil,

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the water, and the salt--
in the direction where

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:90%
I sensed the entity.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
George, I've done
these types of things

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:84%
now all over America
for several years.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I have never heard
a sound like this.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.949 align:middle line:90%
When I did that, this thing--

00:22:14.949 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A wailing sound?

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: A screeching sound
like I've never heard before.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.587 align:middle line:90%
And it departed.

00:22:20.587 --> 00:22:21.211 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scary.

00:22:21.211 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: But I'm
telling you right now,

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I have never heard
anything like that before.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hail from St. Louis.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Born in Detroit.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:90%
But been in St. Louis since '79.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And now Los Angeles.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:32.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm all over the place.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But that's where the
exorcism of the little boy

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:42.060 align:middle line:84%
occurred that they did the
movie The Exorcist for.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And the priest,
the main priest who

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:84%
was involved in that exorcism,
lived in St. Louis, Bill,

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and refused to
talk to the media.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Did not want any
involvement after that case.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
He was, I think, so
overcome by this exorcism

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.255 align:middle line:84%
that he performed, I don't
think he was ever the same.

00:23:04.255 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: I can believe it.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:90%
I can absolutely believe it.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you there's times
when I come out of these things

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:90%
where I'm totally exhausted.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't have anything left.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It killed Edgar Cayce.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.234 align:middle line:90%
That kind of trance like state.

00:23:16.234 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to be careful.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well this is where
I say this is not my power.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:84%
This is God's power
that works through me.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.696 align:middle line:84%
So I have to remain
in 100% faith.

00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So when we have faith,
we have strength

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.903 align:middle line:84%
and we have courage
that go with that.

00:23:28.903 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Faith and fear are
not compatible.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So I have to remain--
doesn't mean I'm perfect.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm fallible.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.684 align:middle line:84%
I make mistakes just
like everybody else.

00:23:36.684 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't claim to be perfect.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.680 align:middle line:84%
However, I could tell you
I try each and every day

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.480 align:middle line:90%
to be the best that I can be.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And I keep my faith strong.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And I rely on God to work
through me and to keep me safe

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:47.320 align:middle line:90%
and protected.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And he does, and I thank
him and praise him for it.

they meet you for

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.423 align:middle line:90%

you say to them?

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I try to explain a
little bit that, again, this

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:90%
is very faith based.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without
freaking them out.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.856 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Without
freaking them out.

00:24:14.856 --> 00:24:16.830 align:middle line:84%
That I'm a man of God,
and God calls us all

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.569 align:middle line:84%
to do certain things
in life, and this

00:24:18.569 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:90%
is what he has called me to do.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm literally the guy that
runs into the burning building

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:90%
when the others are running out.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
way to describe it.

00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: It's the
greatest feeling

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:90%
that I could ever imagine.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine anything
better than that,

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.964 align:middle line:84%
because I know what
it's like to suffer.

00:24:38.964 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is why people
relate to me, George.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
If I walked into a home and
I was this great scholar.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I knew it all.

Yet I'd never had an experience.

It would be cold.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't relate to me.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But being who I am and having
the experiences that I've had,

these people make an
instant connection.

And I'm telling
you right now, when

you're dealing with people
who have been traumatized

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:84%

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:36.913 align:middle line:90%
Oh absolutely.

00:25:36.913 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And I read from
the Bible as well.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.119 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to
have the Bible there?

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I feel it's
essential for me

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.170 align:middle line:84%
because God guides
me in a certain way.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I have a certain
routine of doing things,

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.370 align:middle line:84%
yet each and every case
is unique in its own,

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.470 align:middle line:84%
so I'll do things
differently per each case.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.730 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a structure
of how I go about things

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and that requires reading
biblical scripture.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Psalm 91 is my favorite,
and I read that every time,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Lord's Prayer
and Hebrews 11 and other things.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.271 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is possessed more?

00:26:07.271 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Male?

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Female?

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Child?

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: It doesn't matter.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:90%
It really doesn't matter.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it runs the gamut.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Yeah, I would say--
in thinking about this,

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
off the top of my head,
very few children.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.954 align:middle line:84%
The number of children compared
to the adults is way down.

00:26:22.954 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.579 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the movie
kind of flipped us there.

00:26:26.579 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yeah.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so it's mostly adults.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Mainly adults.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's very sad
because you would

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:84%
be shocked, George,
if I told you

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.250 align:middle line:84%
about some of the higher profile
people that have contacted me

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:90%
for deliverance over the years.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you would be
absolutely shocked.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And people in places of
authority and local government

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.137 align:middle line:90%
Just absolutely amazing.

00:26:52.137 --> 00:26:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At least they're
smart enough to call for help.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes, praise God.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And again, what I do is I
don't just go and perform

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.540 align:middle line:84%
this deliverance and that's
the last they see of me.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.367 align:middle line:84%
I stay involved
with these people.

00:27:04.367 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I tell them I'll stay
in the fight with you.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.962 align:middle line:90%
I stand for you.

00:27:06.962 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They need you.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.961 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I'm in it with
them, because they need me

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:90%
as a source of support.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:84%
When people have
this kind of trauma,

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:84%
it's not a one, two, three
thing that they could just

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.239 align:middle line:84%
say OK, I don't have to
worry about that anymore.

00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they're delivered from it.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
However, it requires
a mindset change.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we have
this kind of trauma,

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:84%
we're so used to being in a
certain pattern of expecting

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.980 align:middle line:84%
things-- and for
myself, for many years

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.901 align:middle line:84%
I expected things
to go negatively.

00:27:34.901 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I would wake up and say
oh what a horrible thing

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen today?

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.650 align:middle line:90%
It requires that mindset change.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I have to
stay with them in the fight

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:84%
to help them along
to where they have

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:84%
that total victory in
mind, body, and spirit.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What percent relapses?

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: A small percentage.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.060 align:middle line:90%
A small percentage.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.120 align:middle line:84%
But it is heartbreaking
when that relapse occurs,

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.210 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
passionate for me

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to see people
delivered from this,

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to see them flourish in
every aspect of their life.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have time to
go into it on this show,

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
but God has led people to me
from so many different places.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Just yesterday in the
airport, a poor lady

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.695 align:middle line:90%
was grieving over a family loss.

00:28:20.695 --> 00:28:21.486 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:28:21.486 --> 00:28:22.152 align:middle line:90%
That's expected.

00:28:22.152 --> 00:28:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I happened to be there
as a minister to help her.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:90%
And she said you know what?

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.702 align:middle line:84%
I believe God arranged
this, because I needed this.

00:28:29.702 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:90%
This is how God works.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had a case where you just

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:90%
couldn't get rid of the demon?

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I've never
had a case to where

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I-- God working through me
couldn't get rid of the demon.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:45.039 align:middle line:84%
However, there have been
cases to where God did work

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:84%
through me to get
rid of it, and then

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
the people went right
back to the things

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that they shouldn't have
been doing to start with,

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:90%
and it's back.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.140 align:middle line:90%
It comes back.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you get
rid of that demon,

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:59.010 align:middle line:90%
that ball, where does it go?

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.792 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well, I just I feel that
God's heavenly giant warrior

00:29:01.792 --> 00:29:04.250 align:middle line:84%
angels carry it off to wherever
they're carrying it off to.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
demon jail up there

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.550 align:middle line:90%
in heaven or something?

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Who knows?

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or hell?

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: One would have
to think that there

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:84%
is some sort of type
of holding facility.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Enoch talked about the
seven levels of heaven,

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and in one of those was
a facility of that type.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Classic
Twilight Zone where

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.170 align:middle line:84%
there was the devil
in the cell, and he

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.214 align:middle line:84%
kept trying to convince
this guy to open the door

00:29:27.214 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:90%
and let him out.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.004 align:middle line:90%
And he finally let him out.

00:29:29.004 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Exactly.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that
happens, I guess.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh yeah.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is where I
have to totally rely on God.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:90%
And I go on behalf of God.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:41.670 align:middle line:84%
I would never ever, George,
proclaim to you or anybody else

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:84%
that I'm this all powerful
individual, and I can do this,

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:90%
and I can do that.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:84%
The glory and the
praise goes to God.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.182 align:middle line:84%
I thank him for working
through me to help others.

00:29:52.182 --> 00:29:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anybody out
there needs your services,

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.264 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you, Bill?

00:29:55.264 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:10%
>>BEAN: The best way
would be billbean.net.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:10%
And it'll connect you to
the ministry site as well.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.960 align:middle line:10%
And I answer every
single message,

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.250 align:middle line:10%
no matter how tired I am.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.240 align:middle line:10%
You're exactly right, there's
times that I get exhausted.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But God re-energizes
me, because this

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:90%
is a mission to me, George.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
else on this Earth

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.135 align:middle line:84%
that I'd rather be
doing with my life.

00:30:16.135 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief," Bill.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: My pleasure.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Demons.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's hope you never need Bill's
services to get rid of a demon,

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.780 align:middle line:90%
to get an exorcism.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:10%
But if you're ever
possessed, if you

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:10%
know of a family member
that has this situation,

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:10%
you've got people like Bill
Bean out there to save you.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.680 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:57.634 align:middle line:90%
