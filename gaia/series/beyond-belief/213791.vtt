What is the True
You Hypnotherapy?

>>LAURIE MCDONALD: It's
a clinic in Sacramento

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:10%
where the main goal is to
identify the authentic self

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:10%
and to create integration
between different aspects

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.560 align:middle line:10%
of the psyche towards
self-actualization.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I teach people to become the
architect of the subconscious

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
mind, creating a
blueprint of how

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:90%
they'd like to live their life.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laurie, how did
this evolution occur for you?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I was on
track to be a psychologist.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:10%
I had considered
being a psychiatrist.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:10%
I did some hypnotherapy
work and realized

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:10%
that 90% of our
behavior is driven

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:10%
from the unconscious
and the subconscious,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:10%
and all other therapies only
working with the 10% left.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So I felt that it was prudent
to go through the right door.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you did.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I did.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly
is consciousness?

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Nobody
knows for sure, George.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But what we do say
is it's an aspect

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:90%
of knowing what we don't know.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
It's an ability to expand
outside of the physical body

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and to elevate
our awareness into

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.795 align:middle line:90%
a multi-dimensional existence.

00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.045 align:middle line:84%
Now, are there different levels
of consciousness, Laurie?

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.218 align:middle line:90%
And if so, what are they?

00:01:53.218 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: There are different
levels of consciousness

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:90%
in the daily world.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:90%
We have the beta brainwave.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking in right now.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
This is a level
of consciousness.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.790 align:middle line:90%
It's critical thinking.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We have the subconscious
mind, the unconscious, all

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.610 align:middle line:84%
correlate to
different brainwaves.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious is
the alpha brainwave.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
We move a little deeper
into the delta and theta.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But more important, we can go
into the gamma brainwave, which

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:84%
allows us to tap into that other
energy that people talk about,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
the place that is outside of
the third dimensional reality.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
all brain-related?

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: No.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the brain is
the biggest inhibitor

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:90%
to consciousness.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is so
expansive that the brain

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
has to break it up into
different categories

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to bring it into us
through different levels.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It has to come through
the unconscious,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
through the subconscious,
create a neural pathway

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:90%
into the conscious brain.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:90%
There's so much out there.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing in
so much information.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious
is on all the time.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:90%
It's basically a receiver.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
It's picking up outside of
your conscious awareness

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:90%
through all of our senses.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And the human has
about 21 senses.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You explored
your consciousness

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:90%
early in your life.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important to people?

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, it's important
that we know what we are

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and who we are so that we
can figure out what exactly

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:90%
we're doing on this Earth.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
If we don't understand
our mind, if we

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:84%
don't learn how to
control our mind,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
then, in fact, we're
opening the possibility

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
of somebody else controlling it
for us through different types

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:90%
of programming.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a program.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
subconscious is a program.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:90%
It's created through repetition.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Subconscious mind
loves repetition.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
It gets it enough, it manifests
it into your daily routine

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:90%
or reality.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.773 align:middle line:84%

control is all about, don't we?

00:03:56.773 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:90%

How important is
that to identifying

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:90%
who we become in this life?

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, past
life, or as others

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:90%
refer to it as reincarnationism.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras, Socrates, many great
philosophers and mathematicians.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about the
soul's ability to travel.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:84%
The idea, though,
is for the soul

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
to travel towards
human attainment,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.950 align:middle line:84%
to become the best
human that we can

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:84%
be that the good and
bad things that happen

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
are just conceptualized
ideas created by the humans.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:84%
What's important
is the experience

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and how we learn
from it, not the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:84%
label that we put on it, because
that's a negative usually

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:90%
or a judgment.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is hypnotherapy,
which is what you are?

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Hypnotherapy
is our ability to,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
through therapeutic
means, that's our goal,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is to create some
form of therapy.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:84%
We access memory
in the subconscious

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.670 align:middle line:84%
to begin the propagation
of deep healing

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:84%
through the integration of
the layers of the psyche.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you have a
judgment-- maybe there's

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
an internal judge that tells
you that you're not good enough

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and maybe there's an internal
mother that coddles you.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's an
internal saboteur.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But once we can identify
them and integrate them,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.713 align:middle line:90%
we're a whole authentic person.

00:05:33.713 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking
of hypnotherapy,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:84%
you recently did a
past life regression

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:84%
with a client who
regressed to a time

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%

that should be brought

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.746 align:middle line:90%
to your conscious awareness?

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.130 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:90%
- And what is that?

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:90%
- Another Earth life.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
- Tell me about that
other Earth life.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.625 align:middle line:90%
- In the Amazon.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:90%
- And what did you do there?

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:90%
See it.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Smell it.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
in through your nose.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Your olfactory sense is
deeply related to memory.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.735 align:middle line:90%
Smell the Amazon.

00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.025 align:middle line:90%
What did you do in that life?

00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:90%
- I was a builder.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:90%
- A builder.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Were you a man or a woman?

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:90%
- A man.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:90%
- What did you build?

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.060 align:middle line:90%
- Temple systems.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:90%
- Temple systems.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
- Temple structures
constructed a certain way

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:84%
aligned to certain lines of
energy coming from the sky.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Much like the pyramids are
in alignment with Orion.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you were in the
Amazon, the temple systems

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:84%
were aligned with an
energy grid from the Earth.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:90%
And the sky?

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:90%
- Mostly the sky.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.890 align:middle line:84%
- When you say that
you were a builder,

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
were you a builder as in
a laborer or an architect

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
as in helping to create or find
the place to put the temple?

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:90%
- In this life I was a builder.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:90%
- A builder.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:90%
- A laborer.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:90%
- A laborer.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And we went back to
this life in the Amazon

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:84%
because there's something
in that life that's going

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:90%
to help you build in this life.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
- Learning the value of labor
over long periods of time.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:90%
- Very good.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you need
to learn in this life?

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:84%
How did you hypnotize
her, Laurie?

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I allowed
the beta brainwave

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
to become less dominant while
allowing the alpha brainwave

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:90%
to become more receptive.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So we relax the entire
body, and then I

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
talk her down so that she can
settle in and settle down.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:84%
The more relaxed you
are, the more open

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.490 align:middle line:90%
the alpha brainwave is.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I could
pace her verbiage

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:84%
emotionally so that we could
resonate with that memory.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Memories are like little
packets of information

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and they are
attached to emotion.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
That's how they're stored
in the subconscious mind, is

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:90%
through the emotional impact.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know past life
regression as Dr. Bruce

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Goldberg, and he just thinks
it's so important that people

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:90%
have this kind of sessions.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, if you
know where you're from,

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:84%
it gives you a better
idea of where you are.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
You're in a better position to
choose your next empowered step

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
towards your own
actualization or unfolding.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not about glory.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not about I was
a great this or that.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
It's about the experience
and the emotional energy that

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:84%
can allow us to
elevate ourselves

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
into a place of empowerment
where we're not creating

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
war or negative judgment, where
we're in a place of acceptance,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:84%
which, if a person's
there, then they

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:84%
can allow somebody
else to believe

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:90%
what they want to believe.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
force a belief.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So being empowered does come
from exploring the self.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it take you a
long time to understand this,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:90%
to learn this?

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: No.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.040 align:middle line:84%
I understood at
quite a young age.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.455 align:middle line:90%
I understood mind over matter.

00:10:26.455 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's quite a gift.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I've been meditating
for well over 40 years now.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It is.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:90%
But it allows--

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Especially when
you're only 35 years old.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And how's that math work?

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, meditation
actually does give us

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
the practice that we need to
learn that deep relaxation

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
to quiet the beta brainwave,
to quiet the inner dialogue,

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.650 align:middle line:90%
to allow the truth to come.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
You know what they say, when
you pray, you talk to God.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
When you meditate,
God talks to you.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:84%
By tapping into
your consciousness,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
how important is that
to healing yourself

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:90%
mentally and physically?

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Can
absolutely heal yourself.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We are extraordinarily
powerful beings.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Every race of entity
in our universe

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:90%
is interested in the human.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:90%
We have great power in creation.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything in this world we
created, we drew the resources

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:90%
from this very Earth.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
We have this wonderful
opportunity to expand.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And as we begin to
elevate ourselves,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:84%
we'll find that eventually,
when the emotional energy is

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:84%
in a peaceful place,
we'll move into what

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:84%
we refer to as fourth
dimensional consciousness

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:84%
thinking and
understanding, where

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:84%
we'll have instant manifestation
of our thought processes.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Here we do manifest
this reality.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:84%
It just takes longer
because it's jumbled up

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.923 align:middle line:90%
with negative emotions.

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laurie, let's
talk a little bit

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:90%
about near-death experiences.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Our friend Dannion Brinkley
hit by lightning several times,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
but these near-death experiences
have changed his life,

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell just by knowing
him after these things have

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.870 align:middle line:84%
How did they offer insights into
the nature of consciousness?

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, it tells
you that this life is only

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:90%
a blink on a giant radar.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like that.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Just like that.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.510 align:middle line:90%
It's just about experience.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that the actual
truest, highest self,

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
say it's in the 12th dimension
and it comes all the way down

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.450 align:middle line:84%
into this density of
the third dimension,

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
where we leave a little piece
of our self as light travels.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit
of us everywhere.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we get those
pieces back, we do elevate.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:84%
There's this opportunity
where the human experience

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:90%
is no longer necessary.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
we do leave the body.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
We leave the body
all the time, though,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
through near-death experiences,
through out-of-body experiences,

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:84%
through death, but through
astral travel in sleep.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Lucid dreaming could also be in
that category of astral travel.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness or soul
moves in and out of the body

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Having a near-death
experience reminds you

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that you're more than
what you think you are,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that you have a duty, a
responsibility to grow,

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:84%
that life isn't about just
playing or earning money.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.110 align:middle line:84%
These are all
externalized ideas.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to move internally,
to be intrinsically motivated,

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to gain insight and awareness,
to expand our consciousness

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.503 align:middle line:84%
and to be kind while
we're doing it.

00:14:05.503 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
the key, isn't it?

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It is.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To be kind
while you're doing it.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:90%
What if you're not?

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, then
you have negative energy

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and you're blocking yourself
or trapping yourself,

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and you'll continuously
be brought back

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
into the third
dimensional reality.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
You cannot move through
the ascension process

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth dimension
if you hold negativity.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:90%
You just can't do it.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:84%
You can't manifest
your thoughts instantly

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:84%
if you hold unbalanced emotions
because we will create harm.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And each dimension has a
middle and a higher vibration.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Though I don't
recommend or advocate everybody

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:90%
have a near-death experience.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
How does it change
yourself when it happens?

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, most
people do become softer.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:84%
They become somewhat religious
for a short time and then

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:90%
that changes to spirituality.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
They begin to
understand their power

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and then they begin to
see their lack of power.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
become nicer people?

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I think that
often that is the case.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:90%
We can all become nicer people.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to die to do it.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
a near-death experience.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be
honest with yourself

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and understand that another
part of the psyche, the ego,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:90%
can get in the way.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's a great
misconception of the ego.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Its job is to protect the soul.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever it feels
that it's not good enough,

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
it's going to speak up too loud
or try to look bigger or better.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:84%
It's only trying to
protect the authentic self.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
When every aspect of
the identity feels safe,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:90%
the true self emerges.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about a
near-death experience that

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
allows people to leave
the body and travel

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
into this unknown area and
pick up all this information?

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, they do come
back with certain information,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and that information is
generally that you're not

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:90%
limited to the physical body.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:90%
And we've never been limited.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
in the word human

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:84%
or in any of our
languaging that says

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
we're limited to the third
dimension or to be encapsulated

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:90%
in a physical body.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
The body is simply a vessel
to hold the spirit, the soul.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:84%
While we have this experience,
your body, your limbs,

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.320 align:middle line:84%
your eyes, your
senses are merely

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:90%
to interpret your reality.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
You're interpreting
this through the body.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
In other areas, you
won't need a body.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's
a beautiful feeling.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:90%
A very specific freedom.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.250 align:middle line:84%
A fluidity of thought
without a body.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Being in a body, too,
though, is also good.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:84%
One is not better
than the other.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything is equally relevant
and important to our growth.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laurie, when you do
your past life regressions,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
you basically simulate an
out-of-body experience,

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
which is similar to a
near-death experience.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a look at another
clip with your client

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.096 align:middle line:84%
where she describes
life in Atlantis.

00:17:26.096 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
- Can you describe Atlantis for
me, the way you remember it best

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.485 align:middle line:90%
or what you loved most?

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:34.285 align:middle line:90%
Majestic.

00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:90%
- Mm-hmm.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:90%
- What was majestic about it?

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:84%
- All the materials, marble
and gold and crystals, giant.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.710 align:middle line:90%
- Giant crystals?

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:90%
- Mm-hmm.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
- What did they use
the crystals for?

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:90%
- Harvesting source energy.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:90%
- Harvesting source energy?

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So would that be energy
like a zero point energy?

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.210 align:middle line:90%
- Exactly.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:84%
- And was that zero point
energy used for other devices

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:84%
or what we would
call electronics?

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.530 align:middle line:90%
- Everything.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:90%
- It was used for everything.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:90%
OK When you were on Atlantis--

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:90%
- Spiritually and physically.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
- So how would they
use it spiritually?

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:90%
- You absorb the energy.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:90%
- From the crystals.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.360 align:middle line:90%
- And you move it up the spine.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:90%
- And you move it up the spine.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:90%
How does one absorb it.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:90%
What was your process?

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.180 align:middle line:84%
- Communion with the crystal
and allowing the transmission

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:90%
to be absorbed.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:84%
- Was there a special
type of crystal?

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.730 align:middle line:90%
- Clear.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.530 align:middle line:90%
- Sorry?

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:90%
- Clear.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:90%
- Clear.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:90%
- Clear.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:90%
- Clear.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Very clear crystal.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Did they use any
other type of stones?

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:90%
- All different types.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
- And were the humans
then all able to absorb?

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:90%
- The emissions.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So do you remember where you
lived when you were in Atlantis?

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.586 align:middle line:90%
- Your home.

00:19:15.586 --> 00:19:17.173 align:middle line:90%
- Mm-hmm.

00:19:17.173 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:84%
- Can you tell me what
your house looked like?

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:90%
- Palace.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:90%
- A palace.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So you were a woman of prestige,
because everyone didn't

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:90%
live in palaces, did they?

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.070 align:middle line:90%
- There were a lot of mansions.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of wealth.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:90%
- A lot of wealth, mansions.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And what food did you prefer?

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:90%
- Fruit.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:84%
- Were the Atlanteans
vegetarian?

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Mostly.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.670 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you were living in
Atlantis, and Atlantis I know

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
existed for a very long
time but it actually

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
did come to an end
at one point, do

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
you know when you were living
in Atlantis, during what

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:90%
part of its--

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:90%
- Glory.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:90%
During its glory.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
- During its heyday,
its top glory.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:84%
When you were in Atlantis
during that time,

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:84%
then would you communicate with
people on other continents?

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
- Do you know who the
Atlanteans communicated with?

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:90%
- Greece and parts of Africa.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:84%
- And how long did you live
while you were in Atlantis?

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Do you know how you died?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:90%
- In peace.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:90%
120 years.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
- So you died at 120
years old, but peacefully.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:90%
- Mm-hmm.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.650 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Your questions were
very provocative.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Did they stem from her answers?

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yes.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Whatever her answers
are, I'm going

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:84%
to try to deepen that or
extrapolate further information

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:90%
to see which way to go.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you hypnotized
her, is she asleep

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:90%
or is she still conscious?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: She's in
between, in between the alpha

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:90%
and the beta brainwave.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:84%
If we go too deep, and this
has happened to me many times,

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I can't understand a
single word they're saying.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I can't take them lower
than that because it's

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.930 align:middle line:84%
too difficult for them to
communicate the experience.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to be
deep to be hypnotized.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, people are hypnotized
while watching a movie.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:90%
If you suspend--

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or driving.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: While driving
too, you can go on autopilot.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But in a movie, if
you're suspending

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
your critical thinking
because they're an actor,

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.282 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking, well,
that's not their real name.

00:21:59.282 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:90%
They don't really live there.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:90%
That's not really happening.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:84%
That would be critical thinking,
beta brainwave thoughts.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:90%
We are emoting as if it's real.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:84%
We're happy, we're
sad, we're crying.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:84%
We are in a trance, which
is why we have commercials.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
ascension mean to you?

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: Ascension means to
me the opportunity for the soul

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.720 align:middle line:10%
to ascend upward through
the multiple dimensions

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:10%
back to where we
eventually started

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.120 align:middle line:10%
or where we may have
started actually,

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:10%
because we don't really know.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But ascension is a process
of human attainment.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Once you're the best
human that you can be,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:84%
then you'll move into
the fourth dimension.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, it's three layers.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Then we move into the fifth.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:84%
The beings in the
fifth dimension

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.900 align:middle line:84%
are actually so illuminated,
so bright that they do robe

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:84%
themselves because when
you're in their presence,

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:90%
you're blinded.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:90%
The light is bright.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's that bright.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It's bright, but
still there's a softness to it.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:90%
It's very bright.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:84%
They robe themselves
because it's difficult.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:90%
The energy has emissions.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can anyone ascend?

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: If they do
their emotional work.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Nobody gets a free ticket.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:90%
You have to address everything.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I
bought my bus ticket.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, well, hey,
you got to do the critical work.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:34.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at the self, do
a critical evaluation on this,

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:90%
on that, and then you accept it.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
You cannot change what
you cannot accept.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to accept all
aspects of the self,

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:84%
gently embrace it, and
then begin to develop it.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
When we're developing
it, we actually

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:90%
do open to our higher senses.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.080 align:middle line:90%
We do become more intuitive.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there different
levels of ascension, like steps?

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: There are
steps to get there.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And then ascension
is chronological

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:84%
because each dimension
has its own parameters.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
fourth dimension

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.660 align:middle line:84%
will look exactly like
the Earth looks now,

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
but the vibrational
frequency will be different.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:90%
It will be higher.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:90%
It will be a higher frequency.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So the third and fourth
dimension obviously

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:84%
exist at the same time,
probably right here and now

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:90%
outside of our awareness.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:84%
That's how people tune
into different things

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:84%
through resonance and
balance, harmonics.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is ascension
important in your development?

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It's crucial.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all
need to ascend?

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, we'll continuously
be tricked or redirected back

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
into a third
dimensional reality.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:90%
It depends on how--

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
see with a-- an empowered person
has control of their mind.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:04.020 align:middle line:84%
If you're externalized and
you're working for the man,

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:84%
then you're not
doing your own work

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:84%
to get you to a
place of healing.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So you have to understand
that the human needs

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.355 align:middle line:84%
to learn from all of the things
that have happened to them.

00:25:17.355 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know,
Laurie, though we've

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.780 align:middle line:84%
ascended to a certain
plateau or a certain level?

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: There's a
shifting in your awareness,

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.790 align:middle line:84%
your perception,
and your intuition.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's in here.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It's internal.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can
see it, though.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:84%
You can tell when a person is
more peaceful, more relaxed.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They're not so
worried about death.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:84%
They're not worried
about anything

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.340 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing
really to fear now.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Now we're here because we have
a project, because we chose it.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to fear.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:84%
When we can eliminate
fear and eliminate

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.510 align:middle line:84%
other negative energies,
we can then ascend.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not talking about not
being afraid of a train coming

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:90%
at you.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm just talking about
not being afraid to live.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we talked
about your introduction

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.340 align:middle line:84%
earlier in the program,
we mentioned that you

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.270 align:middle line:90%
had some ET experience.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I've got a lot of
extraterrestrial experience.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I've had my own
face to face, eye

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:90%
to eye contact with non-humans.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I've facilitated one of
California's largest support

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:90%
groups for experiencers.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I've researched and
interviewed people

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:84%
all over the world
on their experiences,

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:84%
trying to differentiate
through languaging

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.950 align:middle line:84%
how somebody in the Amazon,
perhaps, or somebody in China

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:50.900 align:middle line:84%
might express an ET experience
isn't the same way somebody does

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.337 align:middle line:90%
it in the Western world.

00:26:52.337 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there are
similarities, aren't there?

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.087 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: There are
many similarities.

00:26:56.087 --> 00:26:59.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I got
sent secretly years

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:06.528 align:middle line:84%
of secret videos taken in China
of UFOs and non-human beings.

00:27:06.528 --> 00:27:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
the being look like

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
that you had a direct
experience encounter with?

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I've
had more than one being,

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:84%
but the ones that were
the best are actually

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:23.340 align:middle line:84%
sort of a soft violet color,
almost plasma in nature.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:29.770 align:middle line:84%
They're rapid in speech,
although it's telepathic.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I think their frequency
is just so much faster.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
It seemed rapid,
almost birdlike.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And they were
kind and they asked me

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%
if I were afraid.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:90%
They called me by my name.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:90%
This was my choice.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they know that?

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: How did
they know my name?

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I'm not
quite sure, but I'm

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:53.935 align:middle line:90%
sure we had a past relationship.

00:27:53.935 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, the patient that
we've been looking

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:84%
at on your regression, Julia,
had a past life regression

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.200 align:middle line:84%
that took her to a time
when she was living

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.420 align:middle line:90%
in the star system of Sirius.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at that.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.550 align:middle line:10%
- I'm wondering if you might
be able to give us a little bit

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:10%
more information on Sirius.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I know that on Sirius you
said that you were a leader

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and that you led people
or Sirians to the Earth.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe
more of Sirius to me

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.455 align:middle line:90%
when you weren't in the water?

00:28:40.455 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Or did they have land?

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:90%
- The planet was water.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.600 align:middle line:84%
- The whole planet was water
and you lived in the water.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.965 align:middle line:90%
Were there dwellings--

00:28:55.965 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:84%
- A civilization
under the water.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:84%
- A civilization
under the water.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:90%
- There's two suns.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:90%
- Two suns.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:90%
- So it's almost never dark.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.720 align:middle line:90%
- Wow, that's very interesting.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So the two suns keep
the planet pretty much

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:90%
illuminated all the time.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
underwater in a dwelling,

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:84%
you can move in and out
of the dwelling from water

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:90%
to not water?

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Is a special breathing
apparatuses or anything

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:90%
necessary?

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Did you have family on Sirius?

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.190 align:middle line:90%
- Mm-hmm.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:48.055 align:middle line:90%
- Was there a galactic council.

00:29:48.055 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:90%
- Mm-hmm.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.785 align:middle line:84%
- Were you part of the
galactic or federal council?

00:29:52.785 --> 00:29:58.641 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.641 --> 00:30:01.100 align:middle line:90%
- Mm-hmm.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.650 align:middle line:90%
- Do you know if people--

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Sirians are still
living under water?

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.410 align:middle line:90%
- Mm-hmm.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Laurie, is the patient
aware of what they're saying

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.700 align:middle line:90%
when they come out of it?

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yes, we want that,
which is another reason why

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:90%
we don't want to go too deep.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I have had many, though, who say
they forget large pieces of what

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:84%
they said and when
they watch their tape,

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:84%
they just can't believe what
came out of their mouth.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to keep them
moving emotionally, feeling,

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.900 align:middle line:84%
not thinking, because
thinking is the beta brainwave

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and then we're taking them
out of that in-between place.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
conscious or unconscious

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:90%
when you're hypnotized?

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well,
you're not unconscious.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.420 align:middle line:84%
You're in between the alpha and
the beta brainwaves, sometimes

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.780 align:middle line:90%
the theta brainwave as well.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Many people do go
too deep and then

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.830 align:middle line:84%
I end up having to
talk them back up

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and getting them to a place
where we can communicate.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:05.132 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, like I said,
it's just too difficult.

00:31:05.132 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hear a lot--

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: To talk to
an unconscious person.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hear a lot about
what is called the Galactic

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Federation.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, my
research indicates

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.040 align:middle line:84%
that it is a group
of entities who

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.462 align:middle line:90%
oversee part of our universe.

00:31:22.462 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want with us?

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:90%
What do they tell you?

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, they don't
tell me-- through the sessions,

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to come
to the understanding

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.990 align:middle line:84%
that what they want is
to control the humans.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:84%
They are worried about some of
our steps in our own evolution.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And probably
rightfully so.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Why is knowing about the
Galactic Federation important?

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: You
know what George,

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really sure
it's that important.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:55.980 align:middle line:84%
What they're really
worried about

00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:84%
is the human, being a great
manifestor of reality,

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:04.130 align:middle line:84%
the human can do things
that we can't control.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.340 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard of
experiences where

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:84%
there's been some type
of a traumatic incident

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and the person is maybe trapped
under a tractor or a vehicle

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.107 align:middle line:90%
and somebody can lift it up--

00:32:15.107 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lift it up.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Lift it right
up with no effort at all,

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:22.510 align:middle line:84%
also with no belief
that they cannot.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen a lot of things,
but the only real magic

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I've seen in the third dimension
is belief, self-belief.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And when they do believe
and they hit that-- yeah,

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.752 align:middle line:84%
they lift that
tractor like nothing.

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Pulling the person out.

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if you were to
ask that same person to lift

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:84%
this tractor without the
seriousness of why they were

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.038 align:middle line:90%
doing it, they couldn't do it.

00:32:44.038 --> 00:32:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's right.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It takes trauma or
something to be able to do it.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's a combination of
adrenaline and something else,

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.220 align:middle line:90%
but it's belief, OK.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's the belief that doesn't
impair the person's thought,

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.740 align:middle line:90%
like, I can't do this.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.080 align:middle line:90%
I have to go get help.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.780 align:middle line:84%
They close the gap
and just do what needs

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.920 align:middle line:90%
to be done without thought.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we can
act in that way, we

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.930 align:middle line:84%
can have supreme
clarity of thought,

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:84%
we can exhibit superhuman
strength, superhuman speed.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:90%
We have done enormous things.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So I would imagine that they're
quite concerned that if we

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:84%
continue to move
into the abilities

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.450 align:middle line:84%
that we do possess,
that we may be a threat.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is consciousness
like immortality?

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Well, sure.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.240 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:90%
We are immortal beings.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We basically
live forever that way.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yes, we live
forever as we are energy,

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:48.410 align:middle line:84%
but we transform from
one existence to another.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is incarnation?

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Incarnation
is we are reincarnated.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Carne means meat or flesh.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.850 align:middle line:90%
It means to come into the flesh.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Incarnation.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation means you're
coming back into the flesh,

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:90%
The body is merely a vessel.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people incarnate
from one to the other?

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yes.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.969 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, it
depends on the person

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:84%
and what they've learned if
they've become enlightened

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:25.130 align:middle line:84%
in this life, then
they won't come back

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.179 align:middle line:84%
into a third
dimensional reality.

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we come back
in groups, a soul group.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Your whole family, all
your-- everybody gets--

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:40.270 align:middle line:84%
they reincarnate in
soul groups so that we

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.800 align:middle line:90%
can help each other learn.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
hypnotherapy sessions,

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.690 align:middle line:84%
can you determine how
many past lives they had?

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: No, I don't
have that ability.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras said that he believed
that people had up to 2,400 past

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.340 align:middle line:90%
lives.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2,400.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And he
himself remembered many.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what he did was
he trained his students

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to go through every
step of their day

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.520 align:middle line:84%
before they woke up in the
morning of the previous day

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.960 align:middle line:84%
to train the brain
into remembrance.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
fascinating, isn't it?

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: They are very much
into the reincarnationism.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
call this a science?

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It's a
science and a philosophy,

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.160 align:middle line:90%
and there's math involved.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful cosmic dance
of both philosophy and math.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Out-of-body
experiences,

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.280 align:middle line:90%
where do they fit in?

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.517 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I've had so
many out-of-body experiences.

00:35:41.517 --> 00:35:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Personally?

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.308 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Personally.

00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:90%
They started when I was young.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.893 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was dying and that
this was some form of practice.

00:35:47.893 --> 00:35:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've had one.

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And when I was 11.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:50.670 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.060 align:middle line:90%
And, well, what did it tell you?

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was weird.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I woke up on the ceiling
looking down at my body,

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.140 align:middle line:90%
just bouncing on the ceiling.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I looked.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And for a split second, I tried
to determine what was going on.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.060 align:middle line:90%
I thought maybe did I die?

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
all of a sudden, when

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
you become a little more
conscious of what's going on,

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.570 align:middle line:84%
it slams you back into
your physical body.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up with a jolt
like, that wasn't a dream.

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:25.210 align:middle line:90%
That was too real.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.520 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.360 align:middle line:90%
I never quite understood it.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the library at
11 years old and stumbled

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:84%
into the occult section
and there was a book

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:84%
by Hereward Carrington
and Sylvan Muldoon

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.060 align:middle line:84%
talking about projections
of the astral body.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they had a picture
on the cover of an astral body

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.840 align:middle line:84%
floating over a
human body, the body,

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and I went, that's
what happened to me.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment
on, I was hooked.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:90%
I've had-- I can't even count.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:00.670 align:middle line:84%
There's been so many,
but they would happen.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.860 align:middle line:84%
I would sit down in
a chair to relax.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:84%
The moment I relaxed, I
would pop out of my body.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It continued until I had
this incredibly lucid dream

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.040 align:middle line:90%
of being in this temple.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up, I was quite
disoriented because literally

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:84%
a second ago, like
you say, it's so real.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.230 align:middle line:90%
I really was there.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I ended up
in that temple in real life

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and spent a good five
years meditating there,

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.965 align:middle line:84%
learning how to control my
mind, sometimes for 18 hours

00:37:32.965 --> 00:37:33.765 align:middle line:90%
consecutively.

00:37:33.765 --> 00:37:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It takes a practice.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Meditation is a practice.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I learned more about other
worlds and other beings

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.170 align:middle line:84%
in that five years at
the temple than probably

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.957 align:middle line:84%
from the many thousands of cases
that I've done at this point.

00:37:48.957 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you undergone
hypnotherapy yourself?

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Not since--

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.040 align:middle line:90%
I did about 30 years ago.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at
Julia's regression experience

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.850 align:middle line:90%
and see how she feels about it.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:02.060 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.040 align:middle line:90%
- You really did do great.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.400 align:middle line:90%
You did very well.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.210 align:middle line:84%
You moved from one
past life to another.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:84%
What made it
exceptionally good for you

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is that you moved
from one planet

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:84%
to another, so really indicating
a major expanded consciousness.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Also, your ability to
let go of those energies

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and drift into those lives
has left you calm and relaxed.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Your face is so smooth.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain glow
about your energy right now.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:90%
How are you feeling?

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:84%
- Super like integrated, like
as dropped in as you can be.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Like my voice, I feel
like dropped an octave.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.080 align:middle line:90%
- Absolutely.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Very well grounded.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:52.970 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:55.910 align:middle line:84%
- So you do remember
the different lives?

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.190 align:middle line:90%
- How was that for you?

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.300 align:middle line:90%
- Some I was already aware of.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I had tapped into
different points in my life

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:90%
and some came surprising.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:90%
- Which one was a surprise?

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:90%
- The Amazon.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.670 align:middle line:90%
- I thought so.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:11.580 align:middle line:90%
- I had no idea.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.380 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.080 align:middle line:84%
- But it was like a
gravitational pull

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:90%
that was telling me that.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.672 align:middle line:84%
And I also-- it was
like I was really

00:39:16.672 --> 00:39:18.280 align:middle line:90%
discovering it as I was going.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.780 align:middle line:84%
As there was some of the other
ones, except for the details,

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I had some flashes of it, some
remembrance, but not this one.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.650 align:middle line:90%
This one was a surprise.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:90%
And then also, when--

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I also didn't know that the
connection between Sirius

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and art that I actually came
down and that the corruption

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
of power or that the
use, correct use of power

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.530 align:middle line:90%
was such a big theme.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize that.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Laurie, does a session like
that change somebody's life?

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.587 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Usually.

00:39:53.587 --> 00:39:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would think so.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.003 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Shifts their energy.

00:39:56.003 --> 00:39:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And like she said,
begins to integrate them.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So you do feel
calmer, more relaxed.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
You can settle in
and settle down

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and things don't seem so
heightened emotionally.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.670 align:middle line:90%
You feel calmer, more capable.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the clients go
through a session like this,

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.740 align:middle line:90%
what are they like afterwards?

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Generally
quite curious.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, calm, but curious
and interested in what else

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.790 align:middle line:90%
is next for them.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they
think the soul is

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.510 align:middle line:90%
after a session like this?

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: Well,
they know that it

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:37.790 align:middle line:10%
is a continuous state of being
and that we congregate or gather

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:44.390 align:middle line:10%
in different paradigms
or frequencies of energy.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, now we're back
to math because there

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:84%
are laws in physics
and energy has

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be
explained that way.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand what we
are, and we are just a light

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.250 align:middle line:90%
embodied being.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you do
sessions by Zoom?

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:06.113 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I do.

00:41:06.113 --> 00:41:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that work?

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Way better than I
ever thought it was going to.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.280 align:middle line:90%
It's quite surprising.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Technology
is amazing, isn't it?

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, it is.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:17.083 align:middle line:84%
I was reluctant, but I was
forced during the pandemic.

00:41:17.083 --> 00:41:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
you're there and it's

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.200 align:middle line:90%
like they're there with you.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Exactly.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can
people work with you?

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: They can reach me
at trueyouhypnotherapy.com.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how long
does a session last?

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:33.110 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: I do 90-minute
sessions and three-hour

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:10%
sessions, but I will hang in
there for however long it takes.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you give them a
printed report on what they said

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.240 align:middle line:10%
or--

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.640 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: They record it.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They record it.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Mm-hmm.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then they
listen back to it.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.022 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, the
video or audio recordings.

00:41:48.022 --> 00:41:48.822 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:48.822 --> 00:41:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever
have anybody come back

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.210 align:middle line:90%
to you scared and petrified?

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, yeah,
but for different reasons.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Generally, in an
ET session, they

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.590 align:middle line:90%
may become scared or terrified.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they come back and
work with me for a while.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:13.407 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody has been
abducted, do they know that?

00:42:13.407 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Sometimes
they do know it.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they don't.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.352 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they just
don't want to know it.

00:42:19.352 --> 00:42:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Laurie, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It's always
good to be here, George.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've never gone through
a hypnotherapy session yet,

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.620 align:middle line:10%
but the big word
is yet because I'm

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.620 align:middle line:10%
getting more and more curious
about who I might have been.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:39.540 align:middle line:90%
