>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.205 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest in this
program, John St. Augustine.

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:10%
He's a radio host and producer.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:10%
He's been called "The
Voice of America"

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:10%
by veteran broadcaster
Charles Osgood

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:10%
and has been named a
visionary for using

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:10%
his voice on the radio
for positive change, which

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:10%
is important.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:84%
He has presented at
the TED conferences,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:84%
produced the "Doctor Oz" show,
Earth Matters with Bill Kurtis,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and has authored the bestselling
"Living an Uncommon Life" back

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:84%
in 2006 and "Every
Moment Matters" in 2009.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And he's probably
got more coming.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
John, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN ST. AUGUSTINE:
it's so good to see you.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate the time.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's been a long time.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It's
been at least five,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:90%
six years as I recall.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Life good?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.595 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah,
and we look the same.

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We haven't changed.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Exactly.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:90%
So this is good.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we say that
in 10 years from now?

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Probably not.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's new with you?

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.395 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Oh, you know,
it's been really busy since you

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and I last had time together.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.240 align:middle line:90%
A lot of changes in my life.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:10%
And, in some way,
shape, or form,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.593 align:middle line:10%
kind of a transitional time.

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:10%
I did a lot of radio
for a lot of years,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.412 align:middle line:10%
as you know, and worked
with Oprah, and Dr Oz,

00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:10%
and all those type of things.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.037 align:middle line:84%
And when that kind
of shifted when

00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Oz went to television
in 2010, my career

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.558 align:middle line:90%
started to shift as well.

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
get out of my career

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and kind of go back
into my calling.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's when I
was on the show last time.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It was more
about the personal things that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350 align:middle line:84%
have gone in my life and how
I was able to reassess them

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.845 align:middle line:84%
and have some
markers for growth.

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of production
stuff came out,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:84%
"Earth Matters,"
as you mentioned,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:84%
with Bill Curtis has been
a huge project for us.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a new book
coming out soon.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:90%
So I sleep well and I eat well.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
you've talked a lot

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:84%
about near-death
experiences, but what

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.665 align:middle line:90%
are near-life experiences?

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: So that term--

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.892 align:middle line:90%
I think I coined that.

00:01:58.892 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you did.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.392 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
And I'll take that.

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I gotta put a registered
trademark somewhere.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I've had three times in my
life where I shouldn't be here,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:84%
and all three times had
me more alive than dead.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Even though they were
quote unquote "near-death

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
experiences," they
made me more alive,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
which I thought got
me nearer to life.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
When I was 19 years old, I
was electrocuted-- shouldn't

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:90%
be here.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It was
a faulty wiring on a giant

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:84%
machine, where I was
working in college.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:90%
And I was 19 and bulletproof.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:90%
And I survived that.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.057 align:middle line:84%
And it shook me up, but it
didn't wake me up fully.

00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was 27, I
was in an auto accident,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
hit broadside by a drunk
driver, and obliterated the car.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't be here.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.847 align:middle line:84%
Both times I kind of had
an out-of-body experience.

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And, look, we were talking a
little bit before the show.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:90%
We're both Midwestern guys.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't even put ketchup
on my hot dog, right?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very grounded
in how I see things.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when I have
experiences that

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
are outside of how I grew up,
they're very jarring to me.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So 19, that happened; 27, that
happened; and when I was 43,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I donated a kidney
to my daughter,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and you have to sign a piece of
paper that says, you could die.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And the realization
of that really

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:84%
started getting my
wheels moving forward.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.548 align:middle line:84%
And the worse my life got
sometimes, the more alive

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I became, and I don't
think most people see that.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
functioning with one kidney?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I am.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how's
your daughter?

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.108 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
She's doing well.

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:84%
She's had some setbacks,
but that was 16 years ago.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the fact that
you did this is amazing.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Well, you know,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's that
amazing, but I appreciate that.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it is.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know how rare it is.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand it.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.023 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: But we'd
all do that as parents.

00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:36.683 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, that's a given.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
this other thing.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I kind of got on the stump for
a while about organ donation.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I make a joke, you know, even
if you're a piano player,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.080 align:middle line:90%
you can donate an organ.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is we
have these spare parts.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's part of
how we increase our humanity

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:90%
by doing things like that.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's an uptick
in organ donation

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:84%
from strangers and
angel donors and stuff.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.885 align:middle line:84%
But still, when I went
through that process with her

00:03:56.885 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
when she was just
five years old,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.693 align:middle line:84%
I walked through the
halls of the hospital

00:04:00.693 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
the night before, knowing that I
might not wake up from surgery,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.775 align:middle line:90%
and that was OK.

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But in every room
I passed, there

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
was somebody waiting for
someone else to die to live,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.322 align:middle line:90%
and that wasn't OK with me.

00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:90%
There should be a better way.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
There is a better way--

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:90%
sign the donor card.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.016 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:04:15.016 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe one day
with stem cell technology--

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: No question.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.159 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --we can
make our own kidneys.

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I am waiting
for the day that the headline

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.428 align:middle line:84%
news isn't something
bad that's happened,

00:04:23.428 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
but they figured out
a way to do that.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Stem cells,
what we're learning more

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and more about inner space in
this machine that we have is

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:90%
incredible.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.395 align:middle line:90%
And I look forward to that.

00:04:31.395 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an industry
that could be, huh?

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: All the money
is in illness, not wellness.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.093 align:middle line:84%
Once you figure out
the wellness part,

00:04:38.093 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
something like that, it'd
be the sky's the limit.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me what
happened years ago on top

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:90%
of a state park.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Oh, boy.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So in one of the more
challenging times of my life,

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:90%
I decided--

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:90%
I think it was decided for me.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I just answered
the call-- that I

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
was going to walk from the
upper peninsula of Michigan

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:90%
to Chicago and back on foot.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:90%
And I did this.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]
That's a long walk.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It's
1,000 miles round trip.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm from Michigan.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah, so
you know how far that is.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.157 align:middle line:84%
And you can't walk
on the highway.

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
You kind of gotta zig zag
because it's against the law.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So the long and
short of it is it

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:84%
was a very transitional time in
'96, and everything I had done

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:90%
didn't work.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I was 37, college degree,
knew all the right people,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:84%
did all the right
things, and I still

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:84%
ended up living in a motel
at my family with nothing.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:90%
But I had this recurring dream.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, I'd
see myself walking.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And I took up on that,
and I walked to Chicago

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:90%
with a couple other fellas.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.125 align:middle line:84%
And then they went home, and
then I headed back north.

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And on the way back, outside
of Kettle Moraine State Park

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
in Wisconsin, I got
to the top of a bluff,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:90%
and I had this epiphany.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:90%
I was carrying this backpack.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big guy, but
this was 85 pounds.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I'd been carrying--

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a big backpack.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It is.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And, George, I didn't know
90% of what was in that bag.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Other people packed it for
me in case I needed it.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And I dumped everything out.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And i-- don't need
this, I need this--

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.430 align:middle line:90%
and I had this huge epiphany.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of my life,
most of our lives,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:84%
we walk around
carrying backpacks

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that other people
stuffed for us.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:90%
And it gets heavy.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's a message here.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.653 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Oh, boy.

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And it hit me so
hard, I broke down,

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and I just dumped
everything out.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And I vowed from that point
on, I would never, ever again

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.880 align:middle line:84%
let anybody stuffed my
backpack without telling me

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.700 align:middle line:90%
what's in there.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.383 align:middle line:84%
And it has been a
huge change for me.

00:06:16.383 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when I left there,
I was nearly about--

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.842 align:middle line:84%
I think I left about
80% of it there.

00:06:19.842 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:84%
It was like 30
pounds in the pack.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was light,
as you can imagine.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:84%
But this was this
pivot point for me.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that there's
something for me to do,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and I need to find
out what that is.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned from
that, especially the top

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.458 align:middle line:84%
of that state park, where
a lot of people go--

00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:36.625 align:middle line:84%
and I have this image of
somebody getting to the top

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and going, what's all
this stuff, you know?

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Because I dumped it and left it.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Freebies.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Freebies, exactly.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It was just this
huge pivot point,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%
that we are all called
to do something.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And that call usually
comes through difficulty.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.277 align:middle line:84%
Very rare is it through,
like, you win the lottery,

00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:90%
and your life gets--

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:84%
most lottery winners
blow it anyway.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So the concept that
the good in our life

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
only comes when good
times are around us,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:90%
I think it's false narrative.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
The most difficult, challenging,
backbreaking, neckbreaking,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
knucklebreaking
times of our life

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.560 align:middle line:84%
makes us who we are
because it squeezes us.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when you squeeze
orange juice, you get--

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:90%
orange juice.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, orange juice.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: You
squeeze tomato juice,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you get tomato
juice with tomatoes.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.277 align:middle line:84%
You squeeze humans, all
kind of crap comes out.

00:07:16.277 --> 00:07:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're the ones
doing the squeezing

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.640 align:middle line:90%
without even knowing it.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.057 align:middle line:84%
And I believe life
is squeezing us

00:07:20.057 --> 00:07:21.640 align:middle line:90%
in a way to see what comes out.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.257 align:middle line:84%
And that's our chance to
become better, not bitter.

00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
an epiphany for you?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Huge.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.938 align:middle line:90%
I get a little excited.

00:07:27.938 --> 00:07:29.590 align:middle line:90%
It's only 20-some odd years ago.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the whole walk
was a huge deal for me,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:84%
but that particular point
on top of that ridge

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
was, like, I was going
up, I'd been climbing

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:84%
my whole life to
do the right things

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and live in a certain way,
and I I'd done some of that.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.092 align:middle line:84%
I went to college, I served
like you did in this military,

00:07:44.092 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:84%
did all these things
that I thought

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.847 align:middle line:84%
would get me where I wanted
to go, and it didn't work.

00:07:48.847 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I was climbing, climbing,
climbing, climbing, climbing.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the
top, and I realized,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.460 align:middle line:84%
you can climb the
ladder of success,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.448 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes it's
against the wrong wall.

00:07:56.448 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to figure
out what the wall is?

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So I get to the top,
dumped all that stuff,

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.047 align:middle line:90%
and ever since that day--

00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't always been
easy, but the dominoes

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:90%
have fallen in a certain order.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.940 align:middle line:90%
I paid attention enough.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.523 align:middle line:84%
I kind of followed,
and it worked out.

00:08:08.523 --> 00:08:09.925 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing for you.

00:08:09.925 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It's tiring
and amazing at the same time.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.032 align:middle line:84%
This just doesn't
mean it's easy.

00:08:14.032 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to make this
some sort of big life coach

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:84%
type of thing, because I
think there's far more to us

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.020 align:middle line:90%
than meets the eye.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.860 align:middle line:84%
But life is set up in a certain
way to challenge us, And.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what brings
out the best or not.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm all about that now.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Once the curtain's
pulled back a little bit,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I can't go back to sleep.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think,
the big aha here

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
is our job, as I see it, while
we're here, is to wake up.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's not our job to
wake everybody else up.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to wake up and stay
awake as fully as possible.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's watching the
show or listening to you,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and then they go,
huh, instead of, huh?

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.875 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think when that
happens, a little door opens,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and people start moving
in a new direction.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:90%
But staying fully awake.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the work you've been
doing all these years.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.600 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.047 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Answer
the what-if question.

00:09:02.047 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Understand the why.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.365 align:middle line:84%
The how will take
care of itself.

00:09:04.365 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You spoke at a Ted
conference several years ago,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:90%
and it was pretty dramatic.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:10%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: What we're
here doing today is creating

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:10%
moments.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:10%
And I'm here to submit to you
fully, with all validation,

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:10%
a life-long suffering Cubs fan,
which I haven't figured that

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:10%
part out yet--

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:10%
that somehow, someway,
we create moments.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:10%
And moments then,
in turn, create us.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:10%
And what we're being charged
with today, as a group, all

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:29.960 align:middle line:10%
of you sitting here,
all the speakers

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:10%
that are here, all these
voices, that the challenges we

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:10%
face as a humanity are
pale in comparison.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:10%
We went to the moon,
and then they came back!

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:10%
They came back!

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:10%
And again and again.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:10%
And they go up and
down all the time now.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:10%
And unfortunately, it's the 12th
story on the news, which sucks.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:10%
Because, to me, just
getting here in the plane

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:10%
was a miracle.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't on time, but I got
here, you know what I'm saying?

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:10%
So what I'm saying to you all,
really, in very short form,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:10%
is that all of our
lives are built

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.218 align:middle line:10%
on the moments that
have created us,

00:10:04.218 --> 00:10:05.510 align:middle line:10%
the good ones and the bad ones.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:10%
They show us who we
are, and who were not.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.587 align:middle line:10%
And then we, in turn, off
that, create moments as well.

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:10%
And then we do the
same more and more.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:10%
And now, it's called life.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:10%
The bottom line is,
if you're lucky,

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:10%
you get just over 28,000 days
to play on this little blue ball

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:10%
we call "Earth."

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know if recognizing
that step process of thought,

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:10%
word, and deed will
add years to your life,

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.310 align:middle line:10%
but I guarantee you
this-- understanding

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:31.165 align:middle line:10%
that moments matter will
add life to your years.

00:10:31.165 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.055 align:middle line:84%
So that was representative
of the Earth.

00:10:34.055 --> 00:10:36.055 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering why you
were holding a baseball.

00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:37.847 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Well,
Cubs fan, you know,

00:10:37.847 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:90%
so that talk was for NASA.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you talk
about being nervous,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:84%
an old radio guy like me in
front of 5,000 NASA scientists,

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:84%
what in the world am
I going to tell them?

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seemed like
they liked your presentation.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Well, I had
to make them laugh, right?

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.527 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:10:50.527 --> 00:10:52.432 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.432 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: When men
landed on the moon in July

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.322 align:middle line:84%
of '69, the Cubs were playing
the Phillies that day.

00:10:57.322 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Ron Santo went 4 for 4.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.973 align:middle line:84%
That was the biggest
news in my world.

00:10:59.973 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was big.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It was huge.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Because the Cubs--
that was their year

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.372 align:middle line:84%
they almost went to
the World Series.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But I had the thought
about using that baseball,

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.382 align:middle line:84%
not only to metaphorically
talk about the moon,

00:11:10.382 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:84%
but also about what was
going on with baseball.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.048 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up, at
the end of that, threw

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:90%
that ball into the audience.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.047 align:middle line:84%
And this guy afterwards,
some scientists came up,

00:11:18.047 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:84%
he said, would you
sign this baseball?

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:84%
It was a little rubber
ball I got for $0.99.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
But the concept
was, I am convinced

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
that most of the people in that
room, the moon landing for them

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.250 align:middle line:90%
was an epiphany.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And it got them interested
in science, and space,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:90%
So I needed to tie it in.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.765 align:middle line:84%
We actually showed a
clip of the moon landing.

00:11:36.765 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And I still got chills
all those years later.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:90%
So it was a thrill to do that.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I did another Ted Talk
a few years later.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I find myself amazed at
how far I've come in such a

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:90%
very short time.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think evolution
within a lifetime is all about,

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.055 align:middle line:90%
so I was thrilled to do it.

00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, when you
look back at your career,

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and where you are now, and
what you're doing now, would

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.085 align:middle line:84%
you say that was a pretty
dramatic transition for you?

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
George, listen,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in the waiting
room, and I'm thinking,

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.377 align:middle line:84%
I still don't believe
all this happens for me.

00:12:05.377 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that it's
the luck of the draw,

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.238 align:middle line:90%
it's a lot of hard work.

00:12:08.238 --> 00:12:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult business
you and I are in.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.863 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
things that go into it.

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But when a calling becomes
a career, you know it.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think since
I got hurt at 19,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I woke up a little
bit the thing at 27

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:84%
woke me up a little bit more,
I started saying yes to things

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I never would have
said yes to before.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.152 align:middle line:84%
And the more I said yes,
the more stuff happened.

00:12:25.152 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:90%
I was amazed at that.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.157 align:middle line:90%
And I do look at it.

00:12:27.157 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting here going, here I
am in Boulder with George Noory

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.622 align:middle line:90%
I have another book coming out.

00:12:31.622 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I've got all this body
of work underneath me.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
My best grades in school
are lunch and gym.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Evolution.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.862 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talk
about life being 2.0.

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I do.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.865 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: So the whole
concept of 2.0 is a better

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:90%
version of something.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
They came out with that
in early 2000s, you know?

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you saw these
conferences of computers 2.0

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.510 align:middle line:90%
and whatever it may be.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.770 align:middle line:84%
So the delineation of
2.0 is a bigger version

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:90%
of what already exists.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.023 align:middle line:84%
And, for sure, my
life has been 2.0.

00:13:02.023 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:84%
There's just no
way to predict it.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I could
have decided that this

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:90%
is how my life would go.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I started looking
at all the things

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be ordinary that
turned out to be extraordinary.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized,
for me, that it

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
was the little things
that were so extraordinary

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and not the big
headline billboards.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.722 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it was great
to work with Oprah.

00:13:20.722 --> 00:13:22.097 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it was
great to produce

00:13:22.097 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:90%
the "Dr. Oz" show and travel.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:90%
It was all great.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like him.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.588 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Well, he's a great guy.

00:13:26.588 --> 00:13:28.270 align:middle line:90%
You guys would get along.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:90%
He's a great guy.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.117 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I learned
most from Mehmet

00:13:31.117 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
was, when the cameras were
off-- he's a natural on TV.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:90%
He's got all the right pieces.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.412 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Oprah
created him, didn't she?

00:13:37.412 --> 00:13:38.662 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And she did.

00:13:38.662 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, on one hand--

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's a genius.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: On one hand,
anybody sitting next to Oprah

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:90%
for four minutes looks great.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:90%
She does it just right.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:84%
What Mehmet had was smart
enough to pick up and understand

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.995 align:middle line:84%
he had to move from being
a scientist to a humanist.

00:13:51.995 --> 00:13:52.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:13:52.795 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
He had to do that.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.860 align:middle line:84%
When we first
started his show, we

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:84%
had 59 minutes and
50 seconds to fill.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.103 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:14:00.103 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Much like
you, this is five days a week.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
We taped everything.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:84%
He after four minutes
he folded his arms

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that's all I got how could
it be here that no one heart

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.985 align:middle line:84%
surgeon in the
country so getting him

00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
to where he could be
a humanist instead

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:90%
of a scientist with my job.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:15.840 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah, he's done great.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.257 align:middle line:84%
But the thing I learned from
him, especially, like I said,

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
off screen, was I know that
his motive isn't awards or even

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:90%
the number of people that watch.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
He says, I want to keep people
off the operating table.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And how do you do
that prevention?

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
75% of the money we
spend in health care

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:90%
is end-of-life care.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And the most bankruptcies
in our country

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:90%
is because of medical bills.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So as you talked before
about stem cells,

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
if we can get to where
that opposite happens,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:90%
it's going to shift everything.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But working with all
of them was great.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And there was a huge epiphany.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.868 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be every
day for me at this point.

00:14:51.868 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Oprah's great, and
Oz is great, and I

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:84%
work with Gene Chatzky
and Bob Greene.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I had a great crew and
all these kind of things.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I was prepared
for this before I ever

00:14:59.290 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:90%
got there.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:00.535 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And I didn't
know it until I got there.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think so many times in our
lives these opportunities come,

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
we don't think we're prepared
for them until we get there.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.445 align:middle line:90%
We go, wait a minute.

00:15:08.445 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I know this.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.022 align:middle line:84%
And when I figured that
out, everything really

00:15:13.022 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:90%
went to another level for me.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got this Lincoln
Navigator in Los Angeles

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:90%
that I keep out there.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's an older
model, but I love it.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful car, and
it's big, and it's safe.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm meticulous, John, at
maintaining it to make sure,

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.827 align:middle line:90%
like your body, it functions.

00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:90%
You don't want it to break down.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: That's right.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I bring
it in before it's due.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:90%
They take care of it and stuff.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of weeks
ago, I'm at a stoplight.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it's chugging.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Its chugging.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Oh, no.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sitting there,
and it's going like that.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, going what the
heck is going on there?

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
This has never happened
to me therefore.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I take it into the
dealership, and the guy says,

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't even fit you in today?

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I can't
drive around with this

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:84%
because you think
it's going to stall.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And with my hours,
you don't want

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.285 align:middle line:84%
to stall on a freeway in LA
at 3:00 in the morning, right?

00:16:03.285 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: No.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I drop it off,
he gets me a rental car,

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:90%
and off I go.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.860 align:middle line:84%
He calls me back two days
later and says, it's $1,800.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:90%
And I said, $1,800?

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with it?

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:90%
I take care of this thing.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:90%
It's meticulous.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I bring it in every four months
for its oil change and stuff.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:90%
And he said, two hoses broke.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And all the coolant dumped
into your spark plugs.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And all of them are gone.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:90%
They're destroyed.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:90%
We have to replace all of them.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But we have to get
into this thing.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, $1,800?

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
but it'll work.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.888 align:middle line:84%
But that's the breakdown
of a human body.

00:16:46.888 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: That's right.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As much as you try to
maintain it and keep it fixed,

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:90%
something goes wrong.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And you know,
that's such a sneaky thing.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, you think that'll never
happen because you maintain it.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And then it happens,
whether it's

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:90%
a human being or a vehicle.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.817 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
least expect it.

00:17:01.817 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: When
you least expect it.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%
My nephew was hit
by a car on my way

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.545 align:middle line:90%
out here, broke both his legs.

00:17:08.545 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, 11 o'clock at night
crossing the street in Chicago.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.089 align:middle line:90%
He's 30 years old.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to him from the
hotel yesterday-- are you OK?

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you
know, Uncle John?

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.770 align:middle line:90%
He says--

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's lucky
he's not dead.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: He's
lucky he's not dead.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.337 align:middle line:84%
He said, the first
thing, he's not dead.

00:17:21.337 --> 00:17:24.235 align:middle line:90%
He goes, maybe I needed this.

00:17:24.235 --> 00:17:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he careless?

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Was it his fault?

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.098 align:middle line:10%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: No, it
wasn't even his fault.

00:17:28.098 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:84%
But he was able to leverage this
and pivot in a way that maybe

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:90%
something good can come from it.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.763 align:middle line:84%
And that's a massive change
in consciousness for this kid.

00:17:37.763 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you not see a
car coming your way, though?

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you step back?

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.585 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: 11 o'clock at
night, thunderstorm in Chicago.

00:17:43.585 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
He's crossing the street, had a
hood up to get out of the rain,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and somebody came around
the corner, never saw him.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:90%
He's wearing dark clothes--

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he wasn't looking?

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah,
so it was a convergence.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned that those
things, in my opinion,

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.430 align:middle line:84%
my observation, and definitely
my experience, George, are not

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:90%
accidents; they're incidents.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:90%
There's a huge difference.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So for him,
it was a wake-up call?

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah,
it was an incident.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
An accident is,
you're the victim.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:84%
An incident is
you're a participant.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Shifts the energy.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So he could have
been in an accident.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that insurance
stuff will come out

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:90%
of all this.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.987 align:middle line:84%
But when you change
into an incident-- so

00:18:13.987 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
when I got electrocuted,
it took me 10 years

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.843 align:middle line:84%
to realize it
wasn't an accident.

00:18:17.843 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Car accident took
a little shorter

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.560 align:middle line:90%
because I was waking up.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But all these things
seemed to be something

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm participating in,
not that I'm a victim of,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's what life
2.0 is about, is being able to,

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:84%
at least on that
level, make that shift.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.393 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people
learn by this or do

00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:90%
they miss their opportunity?

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: That's
a really good question.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I think, without getting
too esoteric about it,

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.593 align:middle line:90%
a huge metaphor for school--

00:18:40.593 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
lessons are repeated
till learned.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:84%
They just show up
in different ways.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think the opportunities
are there to learn from.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you do learn from
them, they will repeat.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you respond
as you learn, then it

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.562 align:middle line:84%
can eventually
stop in my opinion.

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's definitely
been my experience.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.228 align:middle line:84%
So I'll have something
that happened to me when

00:18:55.228 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I was 18, 19, 20, and I'll see
a similar thing about 20 years

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:84%
later, but I've
learned in between,

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:90%
oh, I know what this is.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to repeat that.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.332 align:middle line:84%
I think our big
thing in life is,

00:19:06.332 --> 00:19:07.915 align:middle line:84%
when I'm doing a
work around the house

00:19:07.915 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, I have a level.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And our job is keep the
bubble in the middle,

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.652 align:middle line:84%
and life is
constantly doing this

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.610 align:middle line:84%
to see if we can keep
our bubble in the middle.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.902 align:middle line:90%
Those are learning experiences.

00:19:16.902 --> 00:19:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But again, it really
comes down, for me,

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:23.423 align:middle line:84%
is a conscious shift in
understanding that you're here,

00:19:23.423 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:84%
that you're supposed
to be here, there's

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.215 align:middle line:84%
things to do while you're
here, and that you're not

00:19:27.215 --> 00:19:28.393 align:middle line:90%
a cosmic accident.

00:19:28.393 --> 00:19:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you can
start looking at things

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that way, other
things don't seem

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.078 align:middle line:90%
as important as they used to.

00:19:33.078 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a
producer, John--

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and you'll appreciate this being
from the radio industry, who

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:84%
always came into work with
a black cloud over his head.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:84%
His day began with him saying,
I'm going to have a bad day.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Now I learned a long
time ago that when

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
you program yourself
to think that,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have a bad day.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
happens to you.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:90%
It ain't gonna be a good day.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.217 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
You make it fit.

00:19:58.217 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I kept trying
to tell the guy, who

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:90%
was a nice guy, by the way.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Stop doing this to yourself.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
You are programming
yourself for failure.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Right.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stop.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:90%
Why do people do that?

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.735 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I think
there's a payoff in everything.

00:20:12.735 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in all of this,
this gentleman, and people

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:84%
who are like that,
there's a payoff.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Some may feel sorry for him.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:90%
They pay attention to him.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:90%
George Noory's talking--

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere in all human
behavior is a payoff.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's negative
and positive

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:84%
without-- there's
levels of those things.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.458 align:middle line:84%
But there are people that
have abhorrent behaviors

00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and continue to do
it because there's

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:90%
a payoff somewhere in it.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Years, and years,
and years ago, I

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:84%
spoke in Milwaukee at a
prison, just for people

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:90%
who had committed DUIs.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
These were repeat offenders--
over, and over, and over again.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I went in there, and
there's all these guys there,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and they thought I
was going to throw

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.615 align:middle line:84%
the Bible at them or
something and I don't do that.

00:20:47.615 --> 00:20:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And I walked in and I put on an
orange jumpsuit just like them.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Who's this guy?

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.480 align:middle line:90%
I said--

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's one of us!

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: That's right.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Because one decision--
when I was younger,

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.750 align:middle line:90%
I could have been them.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But I changed my
thought process.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't a payoff anymore.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there and
talked with these people.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And some of were getting
out the next day,

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and some weren't getting
out for a very long time.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.007 align:middle line:90%
And I asked them a question.

00:21:09.007 --> 00:21:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, so what's your
payoff in being here?

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:84%
You thought I asked them
how to split the atom.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:90%
They had never thought of that.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Once you start thinking
about what is in this for me,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.975 align:middle line:84%
both positive and
negative, then you

00:21:19.975 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
can start learning
your own behavior,

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
undoing it if you have
the courage to do that.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down with a guy, and
I asked the first question.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.953 align:middle line:84%
I said, so do you want your son
or daughter-- do you have a son

00:21:29.953 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:90%
or-- yes, I have a daughter.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you want her
in here with you?

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Then why are you doing this?

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:90%
What's the payoff.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:90%
He just started bawling.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And he unraveled his whole
life in just minutes.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the
room nodded their head.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
It was their story, too,
just change the character.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.468 align:middle line:84%
So in all human behavior, good
and bad, there's a payoff.

00:21:46.468 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:84%
You do this because
there's a payoff.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that when
people listen to your show,

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
they're getting
something out of it.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:90%
They get lifted up a little bit.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.193 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: That's
why I do what I do.

00:21:54.193 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who do
things the opposite direction,

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.713 align:middle line:90%
that the payoff is different.

00:21:58.713 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a lower energy
kind of thing.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:90%
But it's all about the payoff.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing thrills me more
than being at an event, John,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and somebody comes
up to me who has been

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
a listener of the radio show
or watches "Beyond Belief"

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:90%
and says, you help me.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a great feeling.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.168 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: One of
the drivers picked me up

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:90%
the airport.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.083 align:middle line:84%
We had a phenomenal
conversation here.

00:22:21.083 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I always keep a couple extra
copies of my last book,

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and I signed it to him
and gave it to him.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:10%
And I texted him,
I have a podcast.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.237 align:middle line:10%
He goes, where can I listen?

00:22:27.237 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:10%
So I texted him the podcast.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:10%
And he sends me a
note back and he says,

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.925 align:middle line:10%
this is why I continue
to drive 30 years later,

00:22:32.925 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:10%
because of people like you.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it's because
of people like you

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:90%
that I do what I do.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And that's
what makes the world different.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:90%
I believe that.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a friend of mine
who I would always joke about,

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:90%
and I called him "the cooler."

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Because wherever he went,
something went wrong.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:90%
If he went to a casino with me.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I would lose if he was
sitting next to me.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:84%
He would get up and
leave, and I would win.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:84%
His life was that way, and
he passed away several months

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.117 align:middle line:90%
ago of a prescription overdose.

00:23:03.117 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Oh, boy.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was really sad.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think that was
part of that cooler life.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:84%
But we went to
the Riviera Casino

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
in Las Vegas as a little
birthday present for him

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.533 align:middle line:84%
And he was so negative
about everything,

00:23:20.533 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:90%
even on your birthday.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.130 align:middle line:90%
Come on, have a great time.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:90%
You're not paying for anything.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:90%
It's on me!

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.002 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Right, right.

00:23:27.002 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My casino
host came up to me.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And for people who don't
know what hosts are,

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:84%
hotels will assign somebody
to help you out here

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.810 align:middle line:90%
with perks and stuff like that.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So she came, and
he talked to her,

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and he gave her a hug,
introduced himself.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:84%
She died two weeks
later of a heart attack.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Are you kidding?

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.172 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm going,
you've got to be kidding.

00:23:47.172 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Wow.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.858 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
three weeks later, they

00:23:49.858 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
announced the Riviera was
going to be demolished.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:90%
They leveled the thing.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying to
myself, was this him?

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:90%
The cooler?

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But everything I saw him
touch, something dramatic bad

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Can people be doing
this to themselves?

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.308 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: 100%.

00:24:10.308 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Whether they can
affect other people,

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.267 align:middle line:84%
I'm not smart
enough to know that.

00:24:13.267 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I know that, I think, sometimes
the extent of my reach

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:18.720 align:middle line:90%
really ends at my fingertips.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And other times, like
you, I'll get a note

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.427 align:middle line:84%
from someone who will listen
to a show I did 10 years ago,

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:23.677 align:middle line:90%
and I said thank you for that.

00:24:23.677 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So I know it goes
further than that.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:84%
But I am convinced
that we are, more

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:90%
than anything else, energy.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of energy
you generate attracts--

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or repels.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: --or repels.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:90%
And we create ripple effects.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And those ripple effects--
like, if you throw a stone

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:37.980 align:middle line:90%
in the water--

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:90%
creates those concentric rings.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
thought two things

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:90%
that I'd never heard in science.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
The concentric rings
we think about normally

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.260 align:middle line:90%
would be at the surface.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:84%
But they also go all the way
down, and you don't see those.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:84%
They also, when they hit an
object, they come back to you.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So literally what you
put out comes back.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.295 align:middle line:84%
And it may take years
for that to happen.

00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So this gentleman
you're talking about,

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.087 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine carrying
around that kind of energy.

00:25:01.087 --> 00:25:03.458 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't live like that.

00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feel it.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Now he did his best--

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.668 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And you
can feel it, though, right?

00:25:07.668 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to try to
convey that it wasn't him.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But, privately, those of us who
knew him knew that he did that.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:84%
You had another talk for
the Ted conference in 2017.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I did.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:10%
So here's the challenge.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:26.080 align:middle line:10%
To our linear learning mind,
life should look like this.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:90%
It should add up.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you go in a
straight direction

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:84%
to do all the right things,
and meet all the right people,

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.612 align:middle line:84%
go to the right school, make
the right amount of money,

00:25:32.612 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:90%
it'll all turn out just fine.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So do you see what
we're doing here?

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:10%
We have a linear learning
mindset that has been embedded,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:10%
not bad or good.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.487 align:middle line:10%
There's no class
action lawsuit here.

00:25:44.487 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:10%
You don't get to sue anybody and
blame them because of the way

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:10%
you learn.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.857 align:middle line:10%
You were just taught this.

00:25:49.857 --> 00:25:51.190 align:middle line:10%
But this is what we were taught.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:10%
It should all add up
because it always did.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.670 align:middle line:10%
You all know the
answer to 12 times 12,

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.500 align:middle line:10%
and you haven't been
in class for how long?

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:10%


00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:10%
It's burned in.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:10%
This is how life really is.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.920 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a chart
of my life right here.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.290 align:middle line:90%
There's the start and the end.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Rarely, if ever, adds up.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 12 times
12, 144, right?

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.417 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: You
get an apple for the day.

00:26:17.417 --> 00:26:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's correct.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And everybody
in the world knows that

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.665 align:middle line:84%
because we all
grew up with that.

00:26:21.665 --> 00:26:24.838 align:middle line:84%
It's a base 10 system of
numbers that every human knows.

00:26:24.838 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:90%
The challenge with that--

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: New kids don't know it.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.118 align:middle line:84%
Without a computer, they
can't figure it out.

00:26:33.118 --> 00:26:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And that's
almost a whole other show.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking
about that as well,

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is that I don't
know what's going on

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:84%
with that electronic
learning, but hopefully

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:90%
it benefits us at some point.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it right now.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But for guys like us, and
people around our age,

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and in the last 20,
30, 40 years for sure,

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:84%
this linear mindset
is what we grew up--

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:84%
we sat in lines in school,
and we looked straight ahead,

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.075 align:middle line:84%
and we learned our numbers
in a linear fashion.

00:26:56.075 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we
learned it in our head.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yes,
and it burned literally.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And I learned this
from Mehmet Oz as well,

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:02.695 align:middle line:84%
about how the brain
works, telomeres

00:27:02.695 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff--

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:84%
it literally becomes a burned-in
learning path in your brain.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And so if you say 12
times 12 to most people,

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.302 align:middle line:90%
they'll know what the answer is.

00:27:12.302 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we live our
lives in a linear fashion.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:84%
We drive straight,
we fly straight.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything's set
up in lines for us.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.210 align:middle line:90%
We wait in line, we're online.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I realize at some
point that linear learning

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:84%
is great for books,
and great for concept,

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and great for theory,
and great for math,

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.192 align:middle line:84%
but it has nothing to do
with human math, which is

00:27:29.192 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:90%
another thing I came up with.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why is
it guy like me, who's

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.190 align:middle line:90%
best grades were not in math--

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:90%
my dad was a banker.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And he loved it, but I
wanted nothing to do with it.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand the
language of numbers.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.058 align:middle line:84%
And when I started to
understanding what was going on

00:27:42.058 --> 00:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and how the linear
way I learned was

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:84%
almost a detriment to
the life I was living,

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I had to figure something out.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.072 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
this talk came from.

00:27:49.072 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Human Math."

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.350 align:middle line:84%
The average life expectancy
is just about 78 years now.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's 28,835
days to be alive.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:90%
That's not very long.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.670 align:middle line:10%
But when we think of a linear
fashion, if you're born here,

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.378 align:middle line:10%
you die here, you get
these average life.

00:28:05.378 --> 00:28:06.878 align:middle line:84%
There's no guarantee
of that number.

00:28:06.878 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It is not guaranteed
like 144 is.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: So I was
figuring it this morning,

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:90%
my latest number.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So if it's 28,835,
if I get that far,

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I've already burned
up 21,900 days.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.250 align:middle line:90%
I got 6,800 days left.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
That's either really depressing
or really invigorating.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need to
know those human math

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
numbers because it offsets
a lot of the negativity,

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the ways
we waste our time.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.433 align:middle line:84%
And if you saw
that little chart,

00:28:33.433 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anybody's life.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.770 align:middle line:90%
I know your life has been--

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.103 align:middle line:84%
from growing up in Detroit
to being one of the top radio

00:28:38.103 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:90%
hosts, no problem, right?

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Straight line for you?

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, there were
bumps along the road.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Of course.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big ones.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
But what happens is,

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:84%
because we have
that linear mindset,

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.360 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how to handle
that stuff, and it handles us.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of
the learning curve.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And learning that there's
no guarantee you're

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.873 align:middle line:84%
going to be here
tomorrow, I think,

00:28:54.873 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:84%
is a great way to
start doing what

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:56.380 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to do today.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.297 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
interesting, because the way

00:28:58.297 --> 00:29:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I look at things personally
is tomorrow's my last day.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Well, you have to.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And every
day I get to tomorrow,

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.650 align:middle line:90%
I move it a day ahead--

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: That's right.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.098 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --a day ahead.

00:29:09.098 --> 00:29:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So I don't look at
it and say, well,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.645 align:middle line:90%
I've got 25,000 days left or--

00:29:12.645 --> 00:29:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
You've got one.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've got one left.

00:29:15.413 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:90%
And make it your best.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Do you
remember when that happened

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:90%
for you?

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.735 align:middle line:84%
Was it a thing, or just
always been that way?

00:29:19.735 --> 00:29:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it
happened back in 2000.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I had some personal
health issues myself.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I thought I always took care
of myself, never smoked--

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.675 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: You're
the Lincoln Navigator.

00:29:29.675 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --watched my diet.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But, like the Lincoln Navigator,
something went wrong that day,

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.760 align:middle line:90%
and I got it fixed.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.802 align:middle line:84%
And it changed my perspective
of a lot of things.

00:29:38.802 --> 00:29:41.427 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: See, that's a
wake-up call that you didn't go

00:29:41.427 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:90%
back to sleep from.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And my experience
has been, most people

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:90%
go back to sleep from those.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:90%
You stayed awake.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to.

00:29:48.565 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: You have to.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.757 align:middle line:90%
Well, you don't have to.

00:29:50.757 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a great option.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You should.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:53.158 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: You should.

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:57.327 align:middle line:84%
And, as I said, waking
up is an obligation.

00:29:57.327 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:84%
The more you wake up, the
more you get to wake up.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:01.725 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's probably
why you do what you do.

00:30:01.725 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
also, in addition

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.580 align:middle line:84%
to everything you've done,
you care about the planet,

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.720 align:middle line:90%
as a planet.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.862 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen for you?

00:30:09.862 --> 00:30:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It's
Teddy Roosevelt's fault.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.017 align:middle line:84%
I was 10 years old, I'm
reading a book called--

00:30:14.017 --> 00:30:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You weren't here
when Roosevelt was here?

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.308 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: No, no, no.

00:30:17.308 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not Teddy!

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Maybe Franklin.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.542 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Not even
Franklin and not even Eleanor.

00:30:23.542 --> 00:30:25.750 align:middle line:10%
But when I was 10 years old,
I read a story about him

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:10%
in a Childcraft series of books.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:10%
I was 10.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.007 align:middle line:10%
And it was about him finding a
dead harbor seal in New York.

00:30:32.007 --> 00:30:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And it had died, and
they put it on display.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And he went down and measured
it and all this kind of stuff.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And when the seal
was too smelly,

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:84%
they dumped it in the water,
but they took the skull,

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and they gave it
to Teddy Roosevelt.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:90%
His name was Teedie then.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And they gave it
to young Teedie.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:90%
T-E-E-D-I-E, they called him.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And it became the first
specimen and would eventually

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
become the Roosevelt
Natural History Museum.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
about that grabbed me.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you mean,
there's more to life

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.330 align:middle line:84%
than just sitting here
in Chicago eating cereal?

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:01.410 align:middle line:90%
It was just an odd thing.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: And
then, over time, I

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:03.992 align:middle line:90%
read everything about this guy.

00:31:03.992 --> 00:31:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think the pivot point
for me was in 19 aught 8--

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I love saying "aught."

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't get to say
"aught" as much.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:11.998 align:middle line:90%
We could though, right?

00:31:11.998 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We could if we want to.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: 2 aught--

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.083 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
I've ever used that.

00:31:16.083 --> 00:31:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I like it.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.417 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm from another time.

00:31:18.417 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, 19 aught 8,
the iron ore mining lobby

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:26.502 align:middle line:84%
wanted to take the Grand Canyon
apart and dig for iron and ore.

00:31:26.502 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were within
about 30 votes

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.210 align:middle line:90%
of that happening in Congress.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you think things are crazy
now, they were always crazy.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And TR said, we gotta
leave this alone.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And he created the
Antiquities Act,

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:84%
which eventually created
a lot of national parks

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and those kind of things.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.060 align:middle line:84%
When I read that story,
on top of him being

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:84%
as a kid, this other
thing, I thought,

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.310 align:middle line:84%
we're supposed to do something
with the life support systems

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.720 align:middle line:90%
that we depend on.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can argue about all
the scientific evidence,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.490 align:middle line:84%
but I come from a spiritual
end of this thing--

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
is that there are billions
of species on this planet.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:90%
We're just one of them.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And they don't depend on
us, but we depend on them.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And that right
there should be enough to get

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.903 align:middle line:90%
moving in a different direction.

00:32:04.903 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You lived for 20
years with the Ojibwa Native

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Americans.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I did.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: So that whole
walk thing in '96, I ended up

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
living in this motel owned
by Bruce and Pat Hardwick,

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.460 align:middle line:90%
who are Native American folks.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And Bruce is an elder of the
Ojibwa Nation-- and the three

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.470 align:middle line:90%
fires, and he's still there.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this
long white hair,

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and he's just like a
prototypical guy you'd see.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And Dwayne Kanart, who is one
of the other gentleman who

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:84%
took the walk with
me is also Ojibwa.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And I, coming out of
the Chicago existence,

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:84%
it was like walking into
a movie with these people.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.925 align:middle line:84%
And I learned, and listened,
and was so fascinated

00:32:42.925 --> 00:32:44.550 align:middle line:84%
by their customs,
and their traditions,

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and the respect they
had for each other.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.585 align:middle line:90%
They have these lodges.

00:32:48.585 --> 00:32:50.605 align:middle line:84%
And when one person's
talking, nobody else--

00:32:50.605 --> 00:32:51.480 align:middle line:90%
there's no questions.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You could talk all
day, and people

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:90%
respect what you have to say.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't come from
a city like that.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:57.990 align:middle line:90%
I didn't grow up that way.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.615 align:middle line:84%
And so all these
traditions and things,

00:32:59.615 --> 00:33:02.560 align:middle line:84%
they started to make more sense
to me than the way I grew up.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest lessons
I took away from them is a word

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.263 align:middle line:90%
called [NON-ENGLISH].

00:33:08.263 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [NON-ENGLISH]

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.472 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. AUGUSTINE: [NON-ENGLISH].

00:33:10.472 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And [NON-ENGLISH] means, "that
which expands keeps expanding

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.860 align:middle line:84%
for better or for worse,"
almost like that ripple effect.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they're very, very
conscious of their actions.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Because of what we said before,
they know what they've sent out

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.230 align:middle line:90%
will expand.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And it will keep
expanding, and keep

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
expanding because of energy,
and how we treat each other.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to be mindful
of every second, every moment,

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:35.272 align:middle line:84%
every conversation, every word
that comes out of your mouth--

00:33:35.272 --> 00:33:37.860 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts, your
countenance, how your stance is.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.250 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge
responsibility if you're

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.750 align:middle line:84%
to going to be human
and not just be

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:90%
a human being or a human doing.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was a massive shift
for me, that which expands

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.060 align:middle line:90%
keeps expanding.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got to watch what you
do, what you say, who you are,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.457 align:middle line:84%
where you go, how you
act, and most people, they

00:33:57.457 --> 00:33:58.540 align:middle line:90%
don't have those thoughts.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
learn how to live this way?

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I think
you'd have to ask them.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I'm the
best representative of that.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think their traditions,
over many, many millennia,

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.360 align:middle line:84%
they kind of got watered down
and brought back, watered down

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and brought back, and preserved.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to me,
especially these two guys.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:16.090 align:middle line:84%
One was a boilermaker
for 30 years.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:84%
The other guy worked
at a paper mill.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:21.120 align:middle line:84%
You'd never know-- they traveled
the world, spoken at the Hague,

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:84%
peace conferences-- asked to
speak on their traditions.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And they are not
celebrated authors.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:90%
They're not media people.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But they are solid in who
they know that they are

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.409 align:middle line:90%
and who they know they're not.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And great humans.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.828 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
And great humans.

00:34:33.828 --> 00:34:35.721 align:middle line:90%
And that is so needed.

00:34:35.721 --> 00:34:37.679 align:middle line:84%
That is the balance, in
my opinion, the erosion

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.349 align:middle line:90%
the rest of us kind of create.

00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:43.576 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are we doing to
the planet these days, John?

00:34:43.576 --> 00:34:45.497 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Well,
there's good things.

00:34:45.497 --> 00:34:47.580 align:middle line:84%
I think the good things
are that there is somewhat

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.780 align:middle line:84%
of a consciousness
and awareness.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I remember when
I was growing up,

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
there was those
commercials with the--

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.943 align:middle line:84%
people throw garbage
out of their car,

00:34:52.943 --> 00:34:55.538 align:middle line:84%
and the Native American guy
would have a tear on his face,

00:34:55.538 --> 00:34:56.955 align:middle line:84%
even though he was
really Italian.

00:34:56.955 --> 00:34:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I loved
that commercial.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
He was Italian.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:34:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you know this?

00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't know that.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
He was Italian!

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
want to know that.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: He's Italian.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.055 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: But he
played a good Native American--

00:35:04.055 --> 00:35:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: --so I
guess that's what worked.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we've gotten
out of where you

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.695 align:middle line:84%
don't see people throw garbage
out of their cars anymore.

00:35:09.695 --> 00:35:12.330 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid growing up,
my dad would change the oil

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:90%
and dump it in the sewer.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:90%
No thought process to it.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
No, you can't do it.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, in
my lifetime I've

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:84%
seen some of those things
change dramatically.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, Dick Nixon was
not an environmentalist,

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.360 align:middle line:90%
but he was a smart politician.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.388 align:middle line:84%
So when the Cuyahoga River
was on fire in 1970, '69, '70,

00:35:29.388 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:84%
he created the EPA because
he knew it was a smart move.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.150 align:middle line:90%
It'd get him votes.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So there are things that
happen that have to happen.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of the coin,

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.440 align:middle line:84%
we have people
battling over the--

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.360 align:middle line:84%
if there's one thing
humans know how to do

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.620 align:middle line:90%
is major in minor things.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.410 align:middle line:84%
We know how to argue while
nature acts, as Voltaire said.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have a long way to
go, and there are things

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.530 align:middle line:90%
in the air that don't belong.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.113 align:middle line:84%
There's things in the water that
weren't supposed to be there.

00:35:52.113 --> 00:35:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Manmade chemicals that should be
nowhere near other human beings

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.820 align:middle line:90%
that we're ingesting.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.417 align:middle line:84%
And that's a major
challenge for us.

00:35:58.417 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Now you've written,
produced, and aired

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.950 align:middle line:84%
over 300 episodes of what
you call "Earth Matters."

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many different
kinds of invasive species that

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:12.810 align:middle line:84%
threaten life in the
waterways of America.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:16.680 align:middle line:84%
But recently, a new manmade
scourge has surfaced.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Zebra mussels have
decimated the waters

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Lakes, consuming
plankton at such a high rate

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:27.030 align:middle line:84%
that actually threatens the
fish population in that area.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:30.480 align:middle line:84%
But who knew that simply
washing your face or hands,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.330 align:middle line:84%
or even brushing your
teeth, would put a substance

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:84%
into the water that
never goes away.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:10%
Researchers have discovered
vast amounts of plastic microbe

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:10%
beats, the abrasive particles
that scrub away dirt and grime,

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:10%
then get washed down the
drain and, eventually, end up

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.080 align:middle line:10%
in the water system.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.110 align:middle line:90%
The beads don't dissolve.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.930 align:middle line:84%
The best way you can help
to keep polyethylene out

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:59.760 align:middle line:84%
of the water is to simply use
a good biodegradable soap.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.625 align:middle line:84%
I'm Bill Kurtis,
and Earth Matters.

00:37:02.625 --> 00:37:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good ol' Bill Kurtis--

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:04.845 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Good ol' Bill Kurtis.

00:37:04.845 --> 00:37:05.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --from Chicago.

00:37:05.565 --> 00:37:06.523 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:37:06.523 --> 00:37:09.617 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes
that clip so important?

00:37:09.617 --> 00:37:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: First
of all, it's a no-brainer.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.742 align:middle line:84%
Polyethylene does not
belong in our water supply,

00:37:13.742 --> 00:37:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't care who
you are, number one.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The beads are so small they get
through the water filtration

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.350 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:84%
They end up mostly
in the Great Lakes.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Fish eat them.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Humans eat fish.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.492 align:middle line:90%
Not a good thing.

00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:25.950 align:middle line:84%
The most important
part about that,

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:84%
which is episode 83
I believe out of 300,

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.710 align:middle line:84%
was that a Chicago alderman,
kind of like a local politician

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.080 align:middle line:90%
kind of guy, he heard that.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And he got word to an Illinois
state's person, a state

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:41.348 align:middle line:84%
representative, who, along
with other media sources,

00:37:41.348 --> 00:37:42.390 align:middle line:90%
pulled all this together.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.520 align:middle line:84%
We were kind of the first
to ring the bell on this.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And they came up with a bill
to ban polyethylene beads

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.570 align:middle line:90%
in the state of Illinois.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.250 align:middle line:84%
That bill got pushed
further and further

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:84%
up the ladder, and
one of the last things

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:55.830 align:middle line:84%
that Obama did before he left
office was to ban polyethylene

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.540 align:middle line:90%
beads nationwide.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So about a year
after that aired,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.958 align:middle line:84%
Bill was doing a talk
somewhere in Cleveland,

00:38:01.958 --> 00:38:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I believe, and the president of
the company came up and said,

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.810 align:middle line:90%
I heard your Earth Matters.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that
this was going on.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:90%
I just used facial scrub.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.560 align:middle line:90%
So now, I just use soap.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It may not seem like a huge
deal, but it's a huge deal.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Because one little
piece of information

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.450 align:middle line:84%
can lead to transformation
if it's repeated enough.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And, again, to help
get polyethylene out

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.153 align:middle line:84%
of the water supply,
we're good with that.

00:38:26.153 --> 00:38:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
ever know that?

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Nobody knows that!

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why we do
what we do, George.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.160 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to take
information people would never

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.618 align:middle line:84%
find and give it to them so
they can make better decisions.

00:38:34.618 --> 00:38:36.708 align:middle line:84%
And when I read this little
tiny article, probably

00:38:36.708 --> 00:38:38.250 align:middle line:84%
in the Chicago
Tribune, I don't know,

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.833 align:middle line:84%
three, four, five years ago, I
thought, I've never heard this.

00:38:40.833 --> 00:38:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So I built it out, and
it repeated and repeated,

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:84%
somebody heard it, the
ripple effect took place.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:46.980 align:middle line:90%
And here we go.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about your
thoughts of this beluga whale

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:51.390 align:middle line:84%
episode that you
had in your life.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Oh, boy.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.145 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna put me on
the spot with this one?

00:38:53.145 --> 00:38:54.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:38:54.125 --> 00:38:55.125 align:middle line:90%
We've done our homework.

00:38:55.125 --> 00:38:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: [SIGH] I was
on WGN radio for a few years.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.660 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.850 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
highlights of my career

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:84%
to sit on Michigan Avenue and
talk to half a million people

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was fantastic.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And part of that is--

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Powerhouse station.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Say again?

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Powerhouse station.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.855 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Oh, it was legendary.

00:39:10.855 --> 00:39:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Just like anywhere we've been,
you know who the big ones are.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.820 align:middle line:90%
And WGN was that for me.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Even the Oprah stuff was
great, but getting to WGN,

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.350 align:middle line:84%
sitting on Michigan
Avenue from 3:00 to 7:00

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:22.670 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon on a Friday?

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: That's huge.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.340 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, one of the things was,
I wanted people to experience

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:90%
what was going on in Chicago.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, with the environment,
it's important to me,

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and we have the shedd
aquarium in Chicago,

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.530 align:middle line:90%
which is a fantastic place.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:37.988 align:middle line:84%
And, at the time,
they had what was

00:39:37.988 --> 00:39:39.238 align:middle line:90%
called "The Beluga Encounter."

00:39:39.238 --> 00:39:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And you could get in the water
with a beluga whale, which you

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.243 align:middle line:90%
could never do anywhere else.

00:39:44.243 --> 00:39:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And another one of those
things, like, I mean,

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.150 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I was nine.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:48.350 align:middle line:90%
I could do this?

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea was they
would charge like $250.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:84%
The money would go to help
preserve belugas and things

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.147 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:39:54.147 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And so we set it up.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And I got into the water
with this beluga whale,

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:84%
which was 18 feet long
and about 3,000 pounds.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.430 align:middle line:90%
And I remember two things.

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I know.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I get in the water, and
it's a smaller tank, about

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:84%
the size of your set,
and the water just rose.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And I went-- it was
so cool, number one.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And this enormous mammal
comes up, enormous mammal,

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.762 align:middle line:90%
with this huge dome head.

00:40:15.762 --> 00:40:16.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're there.

00:40:16.845 --> 00:40:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
And I'm right there.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.365 align:middle line:84%
They say, keep your arms
in in your little overalls

00:40:21.365 --> 00:40:23.240 align:middle line:84%
so they don't think
you're doing hand signals

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:90%
and think you're a fish--

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And eat you.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Exactly.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Take your fingers off.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was so humbling because
there's this enormous animal

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.610 align:middle line:90%
that could care less about me.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:37.202 align:middle line:90%
And I cared so much about it.

00:40:37.202 --> 00:40:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
the trainer says,

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.785 align:middle line:84%
we'll have this thing where
you can interact and do

00:40:40.785 --> 00:40:45.993 align:middle line:84%
these things, and we'll
have you touch foreheads.

00:40:45.993 --> 00:40:47.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that strange?

00:40:47.035 --> 00:40:49.493 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Well, it's
not like a cat that bumps you.

00:40:49.493 --> 00:40:51.200 align:middle line:90%
This is a beluga whale.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.000 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In one snap,
there goes your head.

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.228 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:40:54.228 --> 00:40:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And whatever they felt like
they needed to do, right?

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So there was a little bit
of a fear factor there.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.540 align:middle line:90%
But there's a trainer--

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they
were gonna do, but--

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
what could they do?

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:02.485 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Nothing.

00:41:02.485 --> 00:41:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once this thing
chomps down on you, that's it.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Right.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going on the fact
that, as far as I know,

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.600 align:middle line:84%
no beluga whales have
ever eaten a human being,

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.270 align:middle line:90%
so I'm hoping it stays that way.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And we put our heads together,
and they took this picture.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was not just the picture
that was important to me,

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:90%
but this thought came.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I am convinced
to this day that it

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.002 align:middle line:84%
wasn't my thought, that
interspecies communication--

00:41:25.002 --> 00:41:25.835 align:middle line:90%
do you have animals?

00:41:25.835 --> 00:41:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you have pets?

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I did.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: OK, so
there's a communication.

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Even though you don't
verbally hear it all the time.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's telepathy.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Sure.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:90%
This whale gave me an idea.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was, what if there
was a whale that could tell you

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.290 align:middle line:84%
what's going on from
a whale's perspective

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.310 align:middle line:84%
under the water and all
the rest that's going on

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and there was a way
to understand them

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:90%
in a human voice?

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.460 align:middle line:90%
What would you do about it?

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
what that means.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So it set me off
looking, and I started

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:56.780 align:middle line:90%
doing research on whales.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whale that
surfaces about every six years

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and that it has a call
unlike any other whale.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And they can't find it.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:84%
The Navy, your guys, have
the whole ocean mapped out,

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.030 align:middle line:90%
and they can't find this whale.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's pitch is so
high that it's not easily

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.410 align:middle line:90%
picked up on sonar.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:16.990 align:middle line:90%
And so this whale roams--

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.120 align:middle line:90%
nobody responds to its call.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
loneliest whale in world.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And it got me working
on a book, of course.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:90%
And the concept is, which--

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:26.438 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a little
ahead of myself here

00:42:26.438 --> 00:42:28.240 align:middle line:84%
because the book's no
nowhere near done--

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.370 align:middle line:84%
but the thought was
that this animal somehow

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.820 align:middle line:84%
triggered something in my
mind and gave me this idea

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that I never would
have thought of

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:40.729 align:middle line:84%
or had had we not met in the
Shedd Acquarium that way.

00:42:40.729 --> 00:42:42.062 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that interesting?

00:42:42.062 --> 00:42:43.812 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It
keeps me up at night.

00:42:43.812 --> 00:42:45.048 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:42:45.048 --> 00:42:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because
the more weak you get,

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.540 align:middle line:84%
the more you say yes, the
more happens that you'd never

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.415 align:middle line:90%
thought would happen.

00:42:49.415 --> 00:42:51.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of extraterrestrial life?

00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever contemplate that?

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:54.375 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I think
they're already here.

00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah?

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I do.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.530 align:middle line:84%
But I don't see
them as, like, ET.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I see us as a
species, and there are

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:05.250 align:middle line:90%
people who have extra stuff.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And I call those our
extraterrestrials.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I had occasion a few weeks
ago to have a conversation

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:11.312 align:middle line:90%
with Jane Goodall.

00:43:11.312 --> 00:43:12.395 align:middle line:90%
She's an extraterrestrial.

00:43:12.395 --> 00:43:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's still
doing her thing.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
85 years young.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
300 days a year.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing person.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: More
busy than you are.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.300 align:middle line:90%
85 years old, 300 a days a year.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:84%
She was talking about, in the
1960s, somewhere in there,

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.250 align:middle line:84%
she came to a
conference in Chicago.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:28.740 align:middle line:84%
She came out of the jungle
of Tanzania as a scientist,

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.050 align:middle line:84%
went to a conference,
and became a humanist,

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and changed her life.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.530 align:middle line:84%
She said, that's where
something extra happened.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's
extraterrestrials.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're all terrestrial
on this planet.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.410 align:middle line:84%
But those of us who
I see the extras

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:45.060 align:middle line:84%
is the people who are doing
things that are extraordinary.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where we look.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I am not here to discount
anything else that's going on.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.563 align:middle line:90%
That's not my deal.

00:43:50.563 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that
the people that I've

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.355 align:middle line:90%
run into over my lifetime--

00:43:53.355 --> 00:43:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Teddy Roosevelt was
an extraterrestrial.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Cousteau was
an extraterrestrial.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that's reached
outside of themselves

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.358 align:middle line:90%
is an extraterrestrial.

00:44:02.358 --> 00:44:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And they bring something extra
to the deal that we have here.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.358 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think, at times,
I did it right enough to go,

00:44:07.358 --> 00:44:09.240 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I think my dad
would say, yeah, you're

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.073 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial.

00:44:10.073 --> 00:44:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This latest
book, "Phenomenon,"

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:13.325 align:middle line:90%
tell me about this.

00:44:13.325 --> 00:44:14.475 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I
didn't want to write it.

00:44:14.475 --> 00:44:15.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:44:15.275 --> 00:44:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It's personal.

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:20.142 align:middle line:84%
And in Every Moment Matters,
I had a couple chapters

00:44:20.142 --> 00:44:22.350 align:middle line:84%
that were personal that were
real difficult to write.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And I started
thinking, well, again,

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.558 align:middle line:84%
like if someone's
listening to your show,

00:44:25.558 --> 00:44:27.990 align:middle line:84%
if it helps somebody, because
we're all kind of in this

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.260 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what it's all about.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It is.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
same wiring, but we

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.940 align:middle line:90%
have different contact points.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So maybe somebody wasn't
electrocuted when they were 19,

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.850 align:middle line:84%
but they know what it feels like
to have some sort of an injury

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:40.710 align:middle line:90%
So I wrote these things.

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:44.520 align:middle line:84%
This book has been
bothering me for 10 years.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.812 align:middle line:84%
And I started making notes
over a period of time.

00:44:46.812 --> 00:44:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
realize that there

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.852 align:middle line:84%
was this connect the dots of
things I could not explain.

00:44:51.852 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's good and
bad at the same time.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.170 align:middle line:84%
It's good because
maybe that's humbling.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.970 align:middle line:84%
The bad part is, I'm
always going, now what?

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I named the book
"Phenomenon" because,

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.065 align:middle line:84%
to me, that is the
perfect description--

00:45:02.065 --> 00:45:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love that
title, by the way.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Well, yeah.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember the movie
with John Travolta?

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I feel like--

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He got zapped.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.553 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: That's
kind of how I feel.

00:45:09.553 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Like I got hurt at 19,
and ever since then

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:84%
all this other stuff
started happening.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that it's the
total reason a lot of this stuff

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:84%
has taken place in my life,
but I feel like it's the crux.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And everything has
followed since that,

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.400 align:middle line:84%
so it made sense
for me to do that.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.900 align:middle line:84%
It's message, and moments,
and memories and other stuff

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.790 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain in this book.

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And every time I go
back and relive them,

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm once again
learning that there's

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.150 align:middle line:84%
no time limit on the
lessons we're supposed

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:35.270 align:middle line:90%
to learn while we're here.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.937 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
chapters in the book,

00:45:36.937 --> 00:45:39.490 align:middle line:84%
they've happened 15,
20, 25 years ago,

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and in writing them again,
they not only come alive,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.230 align:middle line:90%
I learn something different.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.580 align:middle line:90%
I see who I was then.

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I look at the lesson
that happened.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And, once again, I think, this
is just the most amazing life

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.120 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Each chapter is just
as important as the next one.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I
could move them around,

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're not in any
chronological order.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And they're
all so impactful to me that it

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.850 align:middle line:90%
was hard to decide.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I put 12 in there, so--

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a
chapter on Mother Mary.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.046 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:46:06.046 --> 00:46:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Working for Oprah, Radio.

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.697 align:middle line:90%
This is in 2008.

00:46:09.697 --> 00:46:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And every week, I would
drive back and forth

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:12.520 align:middle line:90%
from the UP to Chicago.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I needed that time.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I still had family in
the upper peninsula.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I would drive
back and forth.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It was about 1,000 miles, as I
mentioned, round trip, driving,

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.530 align:middle line:90%
a little less.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I'm driving back
and minding my own business,

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's nice fall day, and
I got my old [INAUDIBLE],,

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and I got the top
open and music on,

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and I'm coming into the bustling
metropolis in Marinette,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Wisconsin on US Highway
41, split north and south.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.685 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to look across
at this cheese place, where

00:46:38.685 --> 00:46:40.850 align:middle line:90%
I always buy cheese.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And there at the access
road is this vision

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.232 align:middle line:90%
of the Virgin Mother, glowing.

00:46:49.232 --> 00:46:50.808 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Only you could see it.

00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I don't know.

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.540 align:middle line:90%
I was the one on the highway.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.340 align:middle line:90%
It was afternoon.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't middle of night.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
apparition there.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not even Catholic.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.200 align:middle line:90%
And it blew my doors off.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.180 align:middle line:90%
And I got so emotional.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And I heard in my head,
this voice, female voice,

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and it said, "the blessings
of the walk will come now."

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:13.150 align:middle line:90%
I had to pull over.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:14.200 align:middle line:90%
I was bawling.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I looked back, it was gone.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Yeah, totally gone.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I pick up the phone,
my cell phone,

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:19.768 align:middle line:84%
I call the guy I
walk with, Dwayne,

00:47:19.768 --> 00:47:21.515 align:middle line:84%
the Native American
guy, and I'm glad he

00:47:21.515 --> 00:47:23.890 align:middle line:84%
answered the phone because I
can't imagine the voicemail.

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Dwayne, it's John.

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:27.418 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the Virgin Mother was
over here on the highway,

00:47:27.418 --> 00:47:28.460 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know what's--

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.080 align:middle line:84%
He answered, I told
him what happened.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.200 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yep.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.240 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.420 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean, yep?

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.773 align:middle line:84%
This is Jesus's mom
showing up here.

00:47:38.773 --> 00:47:39.690 align:middle line:90%
What's this all about?

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Giving me a message.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah,
and he's like, yep.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.553 align:middle line:84%
He goes, you're gonna
have to search it out.

00:47:43.553 --> 00:47:46.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a guy who would
spend a year on one word.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So my Western mind,
my whatever mind,

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:51.890 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know what
that meant right now.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.310 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't possible.

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So I did a little digging,
and these Marian apparitions

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:57.840 align:middle line:90%
are things that happen.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They happen.

00:47:58.715 --> 00:48:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: But not
to me they don't, right?

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I have no Catholic--

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I was baptized, but
everything else-- that's it.

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't have icons.

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:08.410 align:middle line:90%
There was no reason for this.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, while I'm
writing this chapter,

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.040 align:middle line:84%
10 years later, I
get a phone call

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.340 align:middle line:84%
from a friend of mine who does
not know I'm working on a book.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And he starts telling me
about a mutual friend of ours

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.450 align:middle line:84%
who was in radio for years,
lives in Detroit, actually now.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.060 align:middle line:90%
His name's Kevin Matthews.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And Kevin had an
experience where

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.860 align:middle line:84%
he found the Virgin Mother
statue broken by a dumpster.

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, geez.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And
so he wanted to buy it.

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And the florist
wouldn't sell it to him

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:35.663 align:middle line:90%
until she heard his voice.

00:48:35.663 --> 00:48:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Because our radio guys,
they know us by voice.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.068 align:middle line:90%
She goes, I know who you are.

00:48:39.068 --> 00:48:40.070 align:middle line:90%
You're Kevin Matthews.

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll sell it to you.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So he bought the thing,
took it home, had no hands.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.860 align:middle line:90%
It was broken in half.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:46.910 align:middle line:90%
It sat in his garage.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.950 align:middle line:84%
He went to his local
priest and asked

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:51.210 align:middle line:84%
if he could have
somebody help fix it.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:53.825 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
I got the guy.

00:48:53.825 --> 00:48:54.950 align:middle line:90%
We can make her brand new--

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.620 align:middle line:84%
He goes, no, I want her just put
back together, but that's it.

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Leave the crack, leave the
hands, the whole thing.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And it became the broken
Mary project for him.

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:05.618 align:middle line:90%
Totally shifted his life.

00:49:05.618 --> 00:49:07.160 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even really
know each other

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.220 align:middle line:84%
until I reached out about what
I'm writing, what he's doing.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.380 align:middle line:84%
That's 10 years after
this happened for me.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So not a week or two
later, he invites

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.060 align:middle line:84%
me to come listen to
his talk in Chicago.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And I go to this church, and he
brings the broken Mary statue.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:22.077 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there going,
this all started for me

00:49:22.077 --> 00:49:25.635 align:middle line:90%
on a highway 10 years ago.

00:49:25.635 --> 00:49:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the odds are of that.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to think
about the odds of that.

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there are no
coincidences, you know that.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Well, there
isn't, yet our brain tries

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.000 align:middle line:84%
to compartmentalize, and make
it fit, and make it work,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.883 align:middle line:84%
and understand it, and
it's still going on.

00:49:36.883 --> 00:49:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
ripple effect again.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.360 align:middle line:90%
It keeps going and going.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.003 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat there and watched
people listen to his story.

00:49:42.003 --> 00:49:43.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a guy who,
on radio, was a shock

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:45.950 align:middle line:90%
jock and not prone to this.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And his transformation
is uncanny.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, once again,
that our opportunities

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:54.470 align:middle line:90%
come when we're most broken.

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:57.135 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my
life has been about,

00:49:57.135 --> 00:49:59.510 align:middle line:84%
whether it's being electrocuted,
or given up a body part,

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:00.550 align:middle line:90%
or you name it.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.650 align:middle line:84%
It's always in the worst of
times that the best comes out.

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know
the late John Denver

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and mentioned him
Phenomena as well?

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I did.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:05.890 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He went too
soon, way too soon.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.655 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah,
but on the other hand,

00:50:09.655 --> 00:50:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I like to think, as you say, if
tomorrow's our last day that we

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.770 align:middle line:84%
all come in on time
and leave on time.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And over the 20-some-odd
years since he's been gone,

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:20.122 align:middle line:84%
I kind of think that I
would rather he were here,

00:50:20.122 --> 00:50:21.580 align:middle line:84%
but he did what he
was supposed to.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.560 align:middle line:84%
He lived three
lifetimes in 53 years.

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.490 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:26.407 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole
chapter in the book on him

00:50:26.407 --> 00:50:29.035 align:middle line:84%
as well, because he
just keeps showing up.

00:50:29.035 --> 00:50:29.910 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why.

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:30.827 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your life?

00:50:30.827 --> 00:50:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:34.780 align:middle line:84%
After he passed away,
I had this dream.

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It was every
Wednesday for a week--

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.730 align:middle line:90%
every Wednesday.

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:40.632 align:middle line:90%
He died on a Sunday.

00:50:40.632 --> 00:50:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Every Wednesday for a week, he
would show up in this dream.

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had this
homemade little plane.

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.348 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah,
he bought it from a guy

00:50:46.348 --> 00:50:47.300 align:middle line:90%
for $60,000.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It was a long, easy
experimental aircraft handmade.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And he had done some
takeoffs and landings.

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:54.850 align:middle line:90%
And he went up again.

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And, apparently,
there was something

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.840 align:middle line:84%
to do with the fuel handled,
the way it was positioned,

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and aerodynamics took over.

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.368 align:middle line:84%
When he went to switch
to the fuel tank,

00:51:03.368 --> 00:51:04.660 align:middle line:90%
his left foot was on the pedal.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.485 align:middle line:90%
It put it into a roll.

00:51:05.485 --> 00:51:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And down he went.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:08.767 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: 500 feet,
you're not coming out of that.

00:51:08.767 --> 00:51:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: So that's
difficult and challenging,

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and yet, God, I'd
be hard pressed.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I still stay in touch with
Andy, and his brother Ron,

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:20.780 align:middle line:90%
and we all are still friends.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked Ron many times,
is there any solace in the fact

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:25.608 align:middle line:90%
that he died--

00:51:25.608 --> 00:51:26.900 align:middle line:90%
what he loved to do was flying.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.040 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.623 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know about
that part of it,

00:51:29.623 --> 00:51:32.630 align:middle line:84%
but what I do know is that I
think when you're with somebody

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that has impact and
moment in your life

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're connected
to, that doesn't

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.210 align:middle line:84%
end when they die on a
lot of different levels.

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And, for John, he'd show up
in this dream every Wednesday.

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And the last dream, he finally
said, my guitars aren't where

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.080 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to be.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And I called his manager, and
I said, I have this dream.

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.760 align:middle line:84%
He goes, how would
you know this?

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what John told me.

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows this.

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:54.028 align:middle line:90%
Well, he knows, and he told me--

00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he told you.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
And he told me.

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.175 align:middle line:84%
So that's been one part
of it, and I've had some--

00:51:58.175 --> 00:51:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's incredible.

00:51:59.300 --> 00:51:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: It is.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And things in the lodge that
have happened and stuff.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So he's this constant
present in my life--

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:05.330 align:middle line:84%
presence and present--
and I wouldn't even

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.205 align:middle line:84%
be doing what I'm doing
if it wasn't for him.

00:52:07.205 --> 00:52:09.020 align:middle line:84%
He kind of plucked me
from obscurity in '92

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.947 align:middle line:84%
and put me on a
stage in '94 in Aspen

00:52:10.947 --> 00:52:13.280 align:middle line:84%
in front of a bunch of people
before I had written books

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.197 align:middle line:90%
or done radio.

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.530 align:middle line:90%
And he says, your voice matters.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:17.158 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to do something.

00:52:17.158 --> 00:52:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Three years later, he was gone.

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was right.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE:
Well, we'll see.

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was right.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.307 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: We'll see.

00:52:22.307 --> 00:52:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And people
matter, don't they.

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yes.

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I am hard pressed
sometimes to say

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm a fan of the human
species, because we seem

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.370 align:middle line:90%
bent on destroying ourselves.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sometimes.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.050 align:middle line:10%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: And
yet, I think we're still

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.840 align:middle line:10%
in the evolutionary-- we are the
youngest species on the planet,

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.218 align:middle line:10%
and we act that way.

00:52:39.218 --> 00:52:40.510 align:middle line:10%
We're late-comers to the game--

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:42.460 align:middle line:10%
250,000 years, depending
how you look at it.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So everything else
was already here,

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I was
kind of touting that.

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:47.680 align:middle line:90%
We're the latest to the game.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.910 align:middle line:10%
We always do the most damage.

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:52.210 align:middle line:10%
We are the most significant
insignificant species

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:53.200 align:middle line:10%
on this planet.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.110 align:middle line:84%
We're the only
species that is been

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.980 align:middle line:84%
on affecting the life support
systems that keep us alive

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.760 align:middle line:90%
for cash.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I do my
utmost, as you do--

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I so
appreciate what you do--

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.195 align:middle line:84%
because once
consciousness lifts,

00:53:09.195 --> 00:53:10.570 align:middle line:84%
once somebody
makes a change, you

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:12.790 align:middle line:84%
don't know what they're
going to do later that could

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:14.300 align:middle line:90%
change the course of history.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.300 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago, I'd go out
and do talks in schools

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and talked about
the ozone layer.

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And the Montreal Protocol
was eventually signed right

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:22.060 align:middle line:90%
when I was doing these talks.

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.475 align:middle line:84%
And I said, who knows
that some kid in this room

00:53:24.475 --> 00:53:27.100 align:middle line:84%
is going to figure out, because
of something that was said here

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.060 align:middle line:84%
today, a way to make sure
that the chlorofluorocarbons,

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.710 align:middle line:84%
or the CFCs that do the
damage to the ozone,

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that they can't figure
out how to stop that.

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:35.500 align:middle line:90%
You don't know that.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
ripple effect is.

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But these things
are all connected.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a fan of humans
most of the time.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:44.120 align:middle line:84%
The other times, I'm
kind of like, well--

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was that
movie with Al Pacino?

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:48.840 align:middle line:90%
"Devil's Advocate?"

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.643 align:middle line:90%
"I'm a fan of man."

00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: That's
right, except when I'm not.

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So true.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: Yeah.

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So true.

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> ST. AUGUSTINE: I'm
always honored to see you.

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:59.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing
story of John St. Augustine

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:03.270 align:middle line:10%
and how his life has
changed and yours can, too.

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
