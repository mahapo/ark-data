00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.540 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.640 align:middle line:84%
- Sort of an all
encompassing thing.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Even our conversation
right now has potential

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle line:90%
of being sound healing.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord said,
let there be light.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.530 align:middle line:90%
- And there was light.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.330 align:middle line:90%
- Right.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Sound creating light.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Sound shaped into dazzling tool
can make, break, or rearrange

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:84%
molecular structure
and levitate objects.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.547 align:middle line:90%
- Wow.

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:84%
- George, I think if there's a
take away from this whole thing

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:90%
it's first and foremost.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.473 align:middle line:90%

GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
to "Beyond Belief" we've

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:10%
got an exciting
program for you today,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:10%
Jonathan Goldman with us.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:10%
He's an international
authority and pioneer

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:10%
in the field of sound healing.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:84%
He's also the author of numerous
bestselling books on sound

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and happens to be a
Grammy-nominated musician.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program, Jonathan

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
JONATHAN GOLDMAN: George, it is
a true blessing and a pleasure

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.910 align:middle line:90%
to be here.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Tell me the song that
you were Grammy nominated for.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:10%
GOLDMAN: It was actually
a album that I produced

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:10%
called "Tibetman
Master Chants" that

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:10%
was done with one of the
Dalai Lama's favorite chanting

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:10%
monks Lama Tashi.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:10%
And he has been in my life
for about 30-plus years.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.523 align:middle line:84%
And I recorded him, created
this whole, if you like--

00:01:24.523 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Oh, that's exciting.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.648 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: --combination.

00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: What a great honor.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm interviewing a
Grammy-nominated musician.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Yes, well, George,
I am talking to George Noory,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:90%
even better.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: A little bit
later on in the program,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Jonathan's going to demonstrate
some of these sound healing

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And wait till you hear some
of the sound that's amazing.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But what is sound healing in
the first place, Jonathan?

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:10%
GOLDMAN: Well, on a level,
it deals with, first,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:10%
the idea of what
is sound because we

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:10%
have to understand that
we understand that sound

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:10%
is a vibrational frequency.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:90%
It travels as a wave.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:84%
It goes into either our
ear or into our body.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And when it goes
into our ear, it

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
affects our brain, our nervous
system, our heart rate,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:90%
respiration.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And when it goes into our body,
it basically affects us down

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:90%
to a cellular level.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So sound healing is using
either music, or our own voice,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:90%
or all sorts of different--

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
other types of instruments
to shift and change

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
our nervous system, our
heart rate, our respiration,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.090 align:middle line:84%
our cellular structure,
or our etheric field

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:90%
and do much, much more.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of an
all-encompassing thing.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Even our voices, our
conversation right

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
now has potential of
being sound healing.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How did the ancients
understand this much better

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.898 align:middle line:90%
than most people do today?

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Well, it's so
interesting, George,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
because our ancients and our
modern quantum physicists

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:84%
are in agreement that everything
is in a state of vibration.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
With them, they began with,
in the beginning was the word,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and the Lord said,
let there be light.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:90%
The actual activity--

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.877 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: And there was light.

00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Right,
sound creating light.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually called
acoustic luminescence,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:90%
if you like sound, creating.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:90%
There's a term for that.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But the aspect is that all
these different traditions--

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt, the God
Thoth would think of an object

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and bring it into being
and speak its name.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:84%
In Polynesia, the gods would
hit a gong and through that

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:90%
manifest life or blow a conch.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.490 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, there
was Thoth doing that.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
In ancient India, they
say not a Brahman.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:90%
The world is sound.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning was Brahman
with whom was the word,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:90%
and the word was Brahman.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: When you talk
about ancient Egypt,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
there is some talk
that they used

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
sound to move the blocks
that built the pyramids

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:90%
and floated them into place.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: George, here's a
quote from the "New York Times"

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
science section
February 8, 1988--

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:90%
I just remembered the date--

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:84%
first, sound shaped
into dazzling tool

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
can make, break, or
rearrange molecular structure

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:90%
and levitate objects.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.352 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Wow.

00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: And they were
talking about ultrasound

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
basically being able to
levitate small, little things

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:84%
like ping pong balls but
really with a proper knowledge

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and the proper understanding
of how frequency can empower

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:90%
and encode certain things.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Anything is possible.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Is there a certain
frequency, Jonathan,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:84%
that heals more than
another frequency?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: It's a great
question, George.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think on a level,
it depends upon the person

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
because we are all
unique vibratory beings.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And what works for one
person might not necessarily

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:90%
work for another person.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.252 align:middle line:84%
As an example,
oftentimes in workshops,

00:05:04.252 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
when we talk to people
and say, how many of you

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:90%
are allergic to penicillin?

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the concept of sound
healing comes from the idea

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that everything is in a state of
vibration or quantum physicists

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:90%
and the ancient mystics.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, penicillin
is a frequency

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:90%
or a set of frequencies.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And probably about
80% of any audience

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
is going to find it
therapeutic and healing.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But anywhere from 5%
to 20% of an audience

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:84%
is going to find
penicillin toxic.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Yes.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:10%
GOLDMAN: So it's not going to
be a healing frequency for them.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So on a level, I have never
found an overall frequency

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that works for everybody simply
because of the uniqueness.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How do you
find the frequency

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:90%
to work for somebody then?

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: That is
still, if you like,

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
one of those
questions that people

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:90%
are researching and working on.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:90%
There is, if you like--

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
part of that whole thing is
if you like a formula that I

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:90%
came up with back in the 1980s.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And this was when
I was basically

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
getting my master's degree
from Lesley University,

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.995 align:middle line:84%
and I had a pile of
papers about ye high.

00:06:14.995 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
It's back when people
still had papers.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I collected papers.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
basically correlate

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
the different scientists
and spiritual masters who

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:84%
were using different frequencies
for either resonating

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
the physical organs
or the chakras,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the theatric
centers of the body.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.493 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, my
goodness gracious, I'm

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:84%
going to be the first person
who puts all this information

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
together and just make
everything coherent

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:90%
and make sense.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But instead, I would
find scientists

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.240 align:middle line:84%
A who would use a particular
set of frequencies

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
to heal a particular
imbalance or scientists

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.950 align:middle line:84%
B who would be
using a completely

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
different set of frequencies
for the same imbalance

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and the same thing with
spiritual masters who would be

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
using a particular
mantra for a chakra,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and a different one would
be using a different mantra

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:90%
for the same chakra.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a state
of intellectual angst.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.352 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: And I sat
there with my head

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
in my hands in front
of this computer

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
where I was trying to
write out this book.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, this
inner voice-- because I said,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:90%
how can this be?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't make sense.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.063 align:middle line:90%
I come from a family of doctors.

00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:90%
It should make sense.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So you should be able to
give X, Y, or Z to somebody

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:90%
and it all work.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And an inner voice said, it
is not only the frequency

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
of the sound that creates
its effect but also

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:84%
the intention of the person
making and receiving the sound.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote out on this
screen, frequency plus intent

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.030 align:middle line:90%
equals healing.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think back in the '80s,
that was really questionable.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, with the work
of people like Bruce Lipton--

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Great people.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: --Joe Dispenza
and even Wayne Dyer

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
does a whole show on public
television on intention,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
people are beginning to
accept the power of intention.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
You couple that together, that
sound can encode and carry

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
the vibrations, the
consciousness of somebody else

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and through that
create its effect.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Too bad we couldn't
have a specific frequency

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
for a specific
illness or disease

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and say, if you
have a kidney issue,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
this frequency
takes care of that.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:84%
If your liver's screwed up, this
frequency takes care of that.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Well, there are
people who have done this.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
One of my great mentors
was a British doctor,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
an osteopath named Peter Guy
Manners, who basically invented

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.549 align:middle line:84%
something called the cinematic
instrument that had-- he

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.409 align:middle line:90%
used combination frequencies.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:90%
He called them commutations.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So for every
particular imbalance,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:84%
he would use a
combination frequency

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:84%
of five different
composite frequencies.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are over 600 different
combination frequencies

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:84%
for different organs,
different systems, et cetera.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And this machine still
exists in some forms today.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It does.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, Jonathan,
on Gaia News, John Stuart Reid.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Shares his cymatic invention
about cancer imaging cells.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.740 align:middle line:10%
SPEAKER: The study of cymatics
or the spontaneous geometric

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:10%
patterns produced by
sound when it encounters

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:10%
water or particulate
matter on a surface

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:10%
was coined by Swiss
researcher Hans Jenny in 1967.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:10%
Jenny documented
the patterns that

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:10%
appeared when putting sand or
fluid on a metal plate that

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:10%
was connected to a sonic
frequency oscillator.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:10%
Today, acoustic physics
scientist, John Stuart Reid,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:10%
has partnered with Dr. Sungchul
Ji at Rutgers University

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:10%
to apply synthetic imaging to
identify cancer cells compared

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:10%
to healthy cells.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The two hope to
develop this technology

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to allow surgeons the ability
to more precisely target

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:84%
cancerous cells when
removing tumors.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.312 align:middle line:84%
So what do cancer cells look
like compared to healthy cells?

00:10:02.312 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:10%
JOHN STUART REID:
What we found was

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:10%
that the sounds of cancer cells
are generally fairly skewed.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.140 align:middle line:10%
And, well, I would call
them subjectively ugly.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:10%
Whereas the sounds
from healthy cells,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:10%
generally, the
sounds are harmonic,

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:10%
and therefore, the
patterns that are created,

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:10%
these symmetric, patterns are
very symmetrical by comparison.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And as the cell
has a respiration,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:84%
it's literally making
sound all of the time.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So all of our cells are
singing all of the time.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's
really interesting

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to know that they're singing
in the audible spectrum.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, if we
could hear those sounds,

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
well, it would actually
drive us nuts, wouldn't it?

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably just as
well that we can't hear them.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:84%
However, they are literally
in the audible spectrum.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a question of
having specific tools that

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
allow us to listen
in to those sounds,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and then amplify those sounds
so that we can then hear them.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Well, that's
fascinating, fascinating.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: It is
really interesting.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:84%
John came to a workshop of mine
over 20 years ago in England.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And he's just a
remarkable person.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.940 align:middle line:90%
And he's doing work such as--

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
he's really advanced work
based upon a lot of the work

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:84%
that Hans Jenny, the Swiss
medical doctor, who basically

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
photographed the different
forms of how sound created form.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:84%
George, I think if there's a
takeaway from this whole thing

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
it's first and foremost that
sound can create form, which is

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning was the word.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Here's a manifestation
of sound, creating form.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting back for a
second to Peter Guy Manners,

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
the doctor I was
talking about, he

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.477 align:middle line:84%
called his technology
cymatic therapy,

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:84%
which is a little
bit different, where

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
he would be using
frequencies that he came up

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.350 align:middle line:84%
with projecting it directly
into the body for healing.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
It's now gotten a
different name where

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.917 align:middle line:84%
it's called Simotherapy
to differentiate it.

00:12:04.917 --> 00:12:05.750 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Interesting.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: But it
all works together.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Well, let's take
a little bit more look,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Jonathan, at the work you
did with John Stuart Reid.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.675 align:middle line:10%
[CHANTS]

00:12:15.675 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing, Jonathan.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:84%
It sounds a little
like Gregorian chants.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: That was my intoning
the divine name, which

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:84%
is a sequence of
harmonically related vowel

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
sounds that what I would start
projecting the energy here,

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
go down to the base of my
spine, the root chakra,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and then going back
up in one single tone.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And the story of
how that manifested

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:90%
is really, really interesting.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And to say that I
woke from a dream

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:84%
where I was guided to do
that, and then later on shared

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:84%
this with Gregg Braden, who had
written a book called "The God

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Code" and he was talking
about Kabbalah, what is called

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
the Tetragammaton, the ancient
name of God that was revealed

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to Moses, and I said, I
think I received this,

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't shared
it with anybody

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:84%
because I thought
it was too powerful.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.645 align:middle line:90%
But I give it to you, Greg.

00:14:02.645 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:90%
So I made this recording.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:84%
He presented it
at his workshops,

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and then somehow as all things
happened, George, it got out

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.172 align:middle line:84%
into the internet
and I said, OK,

00:14:11.172 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:84%
it's time for me to release
it and start teaching it.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very powerful
universal sound though.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not just related to the
Abrahamic traditions in terms

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of this and that, but
anybody can intone the sound

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and literally feel the
resonance, the energy going

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:84%
from the top of the head
to the base of the spine

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
back up again,
which is profound.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.180 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: The late
researcher, Dr. Emoto--

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: Yes.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: --did some
incredible work

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:90%
with frozen water crystals.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: Yes.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.060 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: He bombarded
them with sound,

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
what we would call
good music and what

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:90%
we would call harsh music.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And under a microscope, with
the frozen water crystal,

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
the crystals that were
bombarded with what

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.940 align:middle line:84%
we would say pleasant
music looked gorgeous

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:90%
like natural cells, for example.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And the crystals
that were bombarded

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:84%
with harsh music, loud music
were all discombobulated.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.418 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:15:08.418 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Well, George,
that falls very, very much

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:17.060 align:middle line:84%
into the phenomena of frequency
plus intent equals healing,

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that formula that
I came up with.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And Emoto, who I
had the pleasure

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
of having a luxury
with one day, blessed

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:84%
be, he was able to really
project different, if you like,

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:84%
intentionalities
and different music

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
with different intentionality
into the water.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it,
how much of our self is water?

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:90%
80% to 90%.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:90%
How much of the planet is water?

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And my favorite of the
slides, as you mentioned,

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:84%
polluted water, for
example, a water

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
that was projected with harsh
intentionality looks like mud.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And the water that basically
had positive thought

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:84%
forms, positive music
looks like a snowflake.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:02.390 align:middle line:10%
GEORGE: Gorgeous.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: And he took water
from the Fujiwara Dam, which

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:84%
is a polluted dam in Japan,
and basically photographed it.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:90%
It looked like mud.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And then he had a
Buddhist priest,

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:84%
a Buddhist monk priest chant
what is called the Heart Sútra

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
over this water, this same
water for about 20 minutes.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:84%
He photographed it and look
pristine like a snowflake.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what an
extraordinary example about how

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:84%
intentionalized sound can
literally shift and change

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:90%
not only water but our entire--

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.443 align:middle line:84%
how it can heal
ourselves and our planet.

00:16:40.443 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It's dramatic.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.230 align:middle line:90%
What about prayer?

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come in?

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: I almost don't
differentiate between prayer

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:90%
and intentionalized sound.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, if
you think about it,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:84%
most of the prayer on our
planet, it somehow vocalized.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
It's whispered, chanted,
spoken, or sung.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that one of
the reasons this happens

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:10%
is because it helps
focus our intention,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:10%
and it also helps amplify
our electromagnetic field.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
As you know, there is this
phenomenon called heart brain

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
coherence that was basically
discovered by heart math

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.250 align:middle line:84%
where when the
brain and the heart

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.082 align:middle line:84%
are in a state of coherence,
which means entrainment, which

00:17:26.082 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
is a phenomenon of
physics, they're

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
locked in step together,
the electromagnetic field

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:84%
is anywhere from 50 to
500 and even 5,000 times

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
greater than when
you couple that

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
with sound, whether it's a
chant, a prayer, a mantra,

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:41.790 align:middle line:90%
a spoken word.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
As long as the intention,
the energy is right,

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:90%
the field becomes even greater.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's so important
for us to realize

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that we can project healing
sounds even with speech.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%

sound techniques here

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:90%

Tell us what you
brought us here.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Well, this, for
example, is a Tibetan ball

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:90%
that I put a little water on.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And just these are
ancient, ancient vehicles

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and among other
things they create

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:90%
very, very soothing effects.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:90%
This one, I'm just--

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I put a little bit of
water in, so you can hear.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.268 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it
the dolphin bowl.

00:18:17.268 --> 00:18:18.068 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: All right.

00:18:18.068 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Because when
I listen to this,

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:90%
I hear the Dolphins calling.

GEORGE: And you don't
have to listen to it

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:90%
too long for it to affect you.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: And this is an
aspect of, if you like,

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
psychoacoustics where the
sound is going into our ear

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and basically then
being transformed

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
from sound to basically,
ultimately electricity

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and working in our brain and
affecting us and affecting

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
our heart rate and
respiration and brainwaves

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:90%
among other things.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And what's so important
for people to understand

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.190 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a phenomena
called entrainment, which

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
is when we listen to the
sounds, the vibrations,

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.890 align:middle line:84%
the rhythms of the sound
will affect our brainwaves.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So slow sounds oftentimes
will slow down our brainwaves.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Fast sounds will speed it up.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why if you're
going on a treadmill,

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:84%
it's best to listen to the
Rolling Stones and not very,

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:90%
very--

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.125 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: So you keep moving.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: Yes, that's right.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: You brought us
a couple of tuning fork.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:90%

[GONGING]

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: So those tuning forks--

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Soothing also.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: They're very soothing.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.090 align:middle line:84%
They actually were, if you
like, brought down to the planet

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:84%
by my friend Dr.
John Boyer, who's

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful, wonderful
teacher, writer, and healer.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And people focus very
much on frequency,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.800 align:middle line:84%
on the actual single
vibration of one object.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:84%
But really I think
one of the keys

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
is what is called an interval
of the relationship of two

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:90%
vibrating objects together.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And this was known about,
again, by the ancients,

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:84%
by Pythagoras who basically
got his information

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:90%
from the ancient Greeks.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Who came up
with numerology as well.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:10%
GOLDMAN: Numerology.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he's the father
of basically geometry as well

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:90%
mathematics.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And he understood that when you
have a single vibrating string,

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
it creates other vibrations
that occur simultaneously.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:90%
And these are called harmonics.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And these harmonics
basically, they

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:84%
are geometric multiples
of the vibrating string

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and they're
simultaneously occurring

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:84%
so that when we hear a
single sound, whether it's

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
an instrument or a voice, we're
actually healing and hearing

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:84%
multiple frequencies
that are simultaneously

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:90%
occurring together.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:90%
Let me take it one step further.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:10%
And different instruments
and their voice

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:10%
all project different,
if you like, aspects

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:10%
of these harmonics that are
called formance-- not getting

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:10%
too complicated-- and this
is why everyone's voice is

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.970 align:middle line:10%
unique and different
because the harmonics,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:10%
the geometric multiples
that are happening

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:10%
a little bit differently
for each person

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:10%
will basically create this tone
or the timbre of the voice.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Harmonics, if you like,
are the color of sound.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: I want to talk to
you about voice in a minute.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:84%

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:10%
- And as you begin to suppress
this part of your brain,

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:10%
the seat of your identity,
your personality,

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:10%
and you slow your brain
waves down, as you do that

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:10%
and you begin to tune into
energy, that unifying field,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.370 align:middle line:10%
its signature is oneness or
wholeness, or greater levels

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:10%
of order, or connection.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
become aware of it

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and put your attention
on it and as you

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:84%
begin to sense the vastness
of that empty void,

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to focus
on nothing but energy,

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:84%
if you can begin to keep
your attention on it,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.240 align:middle line:84%
it will begin to create
more order or more coherence

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So not only do you change your
brainwaves, but as you learn,

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
you create more order
and more coherence

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
because the brain's
attention is on something

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:90%
that's highly orderly.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And we could say
that the moment you

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:84%
take your attention
off your body,

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
you go from somebody
to a nobody.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:84%
The moment you take your
attention off your identity

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:84%
that's connect to certain people
and certain things or times

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and places, you
will become no one

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
in nothing, in
nowhere, and no time.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is the moment you
become pure consciousness,

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and you disconnect from
everything known in your three

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:90%
dimensional reality.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And we could say then if you're
no longer in the familiar past

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
or the predictable future, you
are falling into the eternal

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
quantum model of reality,

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:84%
all possibilities exist
in the eternal now.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:84%
That means then in the now,
you're no longer in the known.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're in the unknown.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all
possibilities exist.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So to get beyond
yourself then means

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.230 align:middle line:84%
you have to become
pure consciousness.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been saying, if
where you place your attention

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:84%
is where you place your
energy and you take

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:84%
all of your attention
off everything material

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and you began to become nobody,
no one, no thing, nowhere,

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and no time and you
became pure consciousness,

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:84%
what if then you allowed
yourself as an awareness

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:90%
to stay in the unknown?

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:84%
If you can linger without
a name, without a face,

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:84%
without a gender, without your
pain, without your disease,

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
without all the
relationships you have,

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:84%
without your past or
your predictable future,

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense then
that the longer

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:84%
you linger in the unknown
where all possibilities exist,

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:84%
by very theory, the more you
would create new possibilities

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.280 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Do you agree with that?

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: I love it.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And sound is one of the great
ways to get to that place.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Those tuning forks, for example,
which are harmonically related,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
they really, once
you begin using it,

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:90%
they will sort of begin--

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Oh, they're amazing.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: And it's
so interesting.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Joe uses some of my
music in his guided meditations

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:90%
at times.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:90%
So music can be such--

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:84%
music and sound can be
such a great vehicle

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to travel to that, if you like,
eternal now and that place

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.840 align:middle line:90%
of quantum manifestation.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, that feels
very, very correct to me.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: You brought us
another little thing

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that the Tibetan
monks have used.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Well, and these
are called ting shovs.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And they are-- what I found
very, very interesting

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.380 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a phenomena
called binaural beats.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:90%
I call it sonic entrainment.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But using slightly out-of-tune
sounds that would go in one ear

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and slowly out of
tune in the other ear

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.000 align:middle line:84%
so that the difference
between the two sounds

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.120 align:middle line:84%
is basically the same frequency
bandwidth as the brain.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you can
basically induce--

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
the brain, obviously, moves
in different brainwaves things

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:84%
from beta to alpha
to theta, et cetera--

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and you can induce different
brainwave activity using sound.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, this seemed to
be a new discovery.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But on a level that
Tibetan monks have

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.230 align:middle line:84%
been utilizing this
for years, these ting

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.045 align:middle line:84%
shovs, if you hit
them together--

00:25:45.045 --> 00:25:46.755 align:middle line:90%
[GONGING]

00:25:46.755 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: What a great sound.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: --and they create
a slightly out-of-tune

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
little vibrato or really type
of sound that basically you

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:84%
can also use to just go into
a deep state of consciousness.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wondrous,
wondrous tool.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:90%
And I like to utilize these.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.955 align:middle line:84%
And they're also great
for giving people.

00:26:09.955 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:90%
[GONGING]

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Listen up now.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Every class
should do that in school

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.270 align:middle line:90%
before they start.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.720 align:middle line:90%
Class, glink.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: I've given
them to teachers.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's fantastic.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: But that's
wonderful and--

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.067 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How long do
you need to meditate

00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:29.512 align:middle line:84%
with that kind of sound in
order to start feeling better?

00:26:29.512 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Oh, this
is so interesting

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:84%
because I very
recently was given

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
a couple of tools of a
device that basically

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.760 align:middle line:90%
is limited to three minutes.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:90%
And my one--

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.903 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's all?

00:26:43.903 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: I said,
hey, I want more.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:90%
I want more.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.703 align:middle line:90%
And, well, they found--

00:26:47.703 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: They are saying,
you don't need more, right.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.460 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: On a level,
this is so true.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:90%
But, of course, I prefer more.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And more isn't better.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:90%
But by God, this was--

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:84%
the three minutes is basically
for our modern day society

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
where people can't seem to
even stop, take a breath

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:90%
for more than a minute or two.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So three minutes may
seem a lot of time.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I personally like to go for
5 or 10 minutes, minimally.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.820 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's fantastic.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.310 align:middle line:84%
How does sound affect
us emotionally?

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you hear a sound
on the radio as a song,

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%
it gets to you.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just because
of past remembrances.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:84%
There's something to the
music that just does something

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:29.940 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.720 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: Well, this is--

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.845 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It makes you happy.

00:27:31.845 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:90%
It makes you sad and energized.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: This is being studied
in a very, very deep level

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:90%
by actually the NIH.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And all these other groups have
now this deep funding to really

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.280 align:middle line:90%
understand how music works.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So the mechanisms, I mean, there
are lots of different theories.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But let's just
suggest, George, that I

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
think that every person
does have their own unique,

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:90%
if you like, sonic RX.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
That which works for
us, that might not

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.820 align:middle line:90%
work for somebody else.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.945 align:middle line:84%
That's why he's saying to
me, hey, listen the song.

00:28:05.945 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't sound great.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But for you, you listen to it
and it brings back memories.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:90%
It's encoded this and that.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think on a
level that there may

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
be an aspect of the time,
the place, the individual.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.790 align:middle line:90%
So there's a fellow who is a--

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Dan Levitin is a
wonderful neurophysicist

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
who basically I was talking
with him and I said,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:84%
what is the best
music for people

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that they can use
to feel better?

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, doctors
can prescribe things.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Therapists-- he says, but the
music that you like really

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:90%
seems to work the best.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.730 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Period.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.550 align:middle line:84%
"Psychedelica" is another
Gaia television show.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.400 align:middle line:90%
You were part of it.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: Mhm.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: And you guys talked
about the shamanic use of sound

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.335 align:middle line:84%
and how it can induce
altered states.

00:28:55.335 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.960 align:middle line:10%
SPEAKER 1: But how
can vocalizations

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.360 align:middle line:10%
induce states of
consciousness that open us up

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:10%
to the nature around
us as the shamans did?

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.270 align:middle line:10%
Even beyond the words
that are being sung,

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:10%
the intention behind them,
including how and when

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.670 align:middle line:10%
they are used, seem to
make all the difference

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:10%
in the shamanic traditions.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:10%
SPEAKER 2: So there's a way
to communicate through songs

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:24.990 align:middle line:10%
not only among humans but
to everything that exists.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I say you
can sing to the sun.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:90%
You could sing to the Earth.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:90%
You could sing to peyote.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.140 align:middle line:90%
You could sing to ayahuasca.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing is
you're singing gratitude.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:90%
You're singing love.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:90%
You're singing appreciation.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You're singing the
desire for information.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:52.310 align:middle line:84%
You're singing this
unifying-creating harmony

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:57.260 align:middle line:84%
through music, through playing
songs, through singing songs.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:90%
This is a language.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Singing and songs, whether
they're with your voice

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:07.250 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're
instruments, is a vibration

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.830 align:middle line:90%
of spirit communication.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole different
sensory perception.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're in a
ceremony and you're just

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:19.040 align:middle line:84%
sitting there
listening to songs,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.680 align:middle line:84%
once the songs come
from within you

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and your voice is
activated, you're

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:90%
like in another dimension.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a total new dimension.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Then your things-- it's like
it activates more information.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.500 align:middle line:90%

SPEAKER 1: Whether the sounds
are self produced or listened

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to, ancient civilizations
have used sonic manipulation

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.167 align:middle line:84%
to induce expanded
states of consciousness

00:30:46.167 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:90%

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.670 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: That's
fantastic, Jonathan.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.470 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: I love--

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: I'm beginning
to love this stuff.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Well, it's
so interesting.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.270 align:middle line:84%
That fellow was so
correct in terms

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:84%
of the energy of appreciation
of kindness and gratitude

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.680 align:middle line:84%
when we work with
that and even just--

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.580 align:middle line:84%
George, lately the sound that
I've become most enamored with

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:84%
is the simple hum,
believe it or not.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.800 align:middle line:90%
I've gone doing deep--

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.010 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with all sorts of
things from Tibetan deep voice

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:84%
to harmonic chants to mantras to
all sorts of different things.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:29.030 align:middle line:84%
But I'm finding that for as
a, if you like, sonic tool

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that everybody can use
it's just the idea--

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
my wife, Andy, and
I created something

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.430 align:middle line:90%
called the conscious hum.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is simply taking
a nice deep breath,

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and then humming on one
tone, a comfortable tone,

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and you do this around
three different--

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.472 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:31:48.472 --> 00:31:51.860 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And you do this around
three, four, five times.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.650 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: And what
does it do to you?

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:04.600 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Number one,
physiologically lowers

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.990 align:middle line:84%
your heart rate, your
respiration, your brain waves.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It causes the
release of melatonin,

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:90%
causes the release of oxytocin.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It causes, and this is
very big, the release

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of nitric oxide, which is
great for your arteries.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And also, it is a
wonderful anti-viral agent.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:24.940 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of people--

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.180 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: So you can
hum and basically

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.310 align:middle line:84%
get all sorts of nasty
critters in your sinus cavity

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:35.200 align:middle line:84%
to dissipate simply by
[HUMMING] so this is an aspect.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that humming
is a very, very powerful

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.070 align:middle line:84%
ancient, sacred yogic
technique that is technically

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:84%
called Brahma Pranayama where
the practitioner will block

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:90%
their ears and do a Mudra.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:84%
But basically,
it's just conscious

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.310 align:middle line:84%
humming, humming on
one tone for a while,

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.230 align:middle line:90%
and it's very, very powerful.

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:01.270 align:middle line:84%
That's just one
aspect, let alone,

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.400 align:middle line:84%
what is your
intentionality for it?

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.210 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:84%
You can project the hum to
different parts of your body

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and create an internal
sonic massage that's great,

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:84%
or you can project
it outward as you're

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:16.620 align:middle line:84%
doing it to interface
with angels, spirits,

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.100 align:middle line:90%
the trees, and whatnot.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite amazing.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.740 align:middle line:84%
The aspect of sound is
an all-encompassing,

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.167 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional phenomena
that everybody can experience.

00:33:26.167 --> 00:33:28.500 align:middle line:84%
We can do it through listening
through different sounds.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.250 align:middle line:84%
We can do it through making
our own sounds and something as

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.840 align:middle line:90%
simple, once again, as humming.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I love humming because
everybody can do it.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I have not met a person
who said, I'm a bad hummer.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's right.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember the movie "Close
Encounters of the Third kind"?

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.260 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: Indeed, sir.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:49.110 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Yes, series of notes,
bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.780 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: That's right.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.540 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: What was that all about?

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Communicating with sound.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Yes, well, that
is a great, if you like,

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:04.970 align:middle line:84%
model for the fact that probably
rather than language, tonality.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.970 align:middle line:84%
It was a tonal language
that they used.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Peter Guy
Manners, the mentor of mine

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.480 align:middle line:84%
who invented the
cinematic instrument,

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.219 align:middle line:84%
suggested to me
that, that may have

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.968 align:middle line:84%
been a tonality for the
molecular structure of water.

00:34:19.968 --> 00:34:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
the truth of that.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.552 align:middle line:90%
But that's a great story.

00:34:22.552 --> 00:34:24.050 align:middle line:90%
But I love the idea.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's been suggested that
Steven Spielberg actually

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.730 align:middle line:84%
was, if you like, encoded with
information of something that

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:84%
happened on another, shall we
say, parallel dimension where

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.060 align:middle line:84%
these beings landed
and communicated

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:84%
with us through tonal
language, through sound.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: He understood sound.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.840 align:middle line:84%
You put those notes in
there, and it was amazing.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.290 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: And that was John
Williams too, who's brilliant.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: I have seen
depictions of Egyptians

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:84%
with horns, blowing horns
throughout the cities.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.100 align:middle line:90%
What was that all about?

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.590 align:middle line:90%


00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.710 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: You just really
reminded me of Joshua

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:05.783 align:middle line:90%
and the walls of Jericho.

00:35:05.783 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:84%
These would have
been, of course--

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:07.860 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That was it.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:08.660 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: The idea that you--
look, you can use sound.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I like to say there
are two ways you

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.430 align:middle line:84%
can use sound, constructively
or destructively.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Constructively is you're using
sound to basically encode

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and enforce and
make more healthy

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.870 align:middle line:84%
a part of the body that's
vibrating out of ease or out

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:28.672 align:middle line:90%
of harmony.

00:35:28.672 --> 00:35:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And when it's vibrating
out of ease or harmony,

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.750 align:middle line:90%
we say it's disease.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you can use
sound to basically put

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.960 align:middle line:84%
that part of the body back
in, and that's constructive.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:84%
But destructive is such as John
Stuart Reid was talking about.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And Royal Rife did
stuff like that.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's another fellow,
Anthony Holland from Skidmore,

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.020 align:middle line:84%
who's actually used
specific frequencies

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.550 align:middle line:90%
to shatter cancer cells.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
call the destructive.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, with
Joshua going around

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:57.330 align:middle line:84%
the walls of Jericho and
the people were chanting

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and they gave a great shout
and the walls came down.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So there, if they've
been able to figure out

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.690 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational structure
of whatever mortar

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.438 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that
made up with, they

00:36:08.438 --> 00:36:10.230 align:middle line:84%
could have literally
cause it to resonate--

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.190 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It really happened.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.680 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: It seems to have, yes.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.210 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: On a Gaia show
called "Sounds of Creation"--

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: Yes.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: --they talk
about the relationship

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:90%
between sounds and megaliths.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.155 align:middle line:84%
I want your reaction
to this after that.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.730 align:middle line:84%
SPEAKER 1: How were these
giant stone structures created?

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.950 align:middle line:90%
And by whom?

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.750 align:middle line:10%
- People who was transforming to
higher states of consciousness.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And in these higher
states, they got

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:43.500 align:middle line:84%
understanding what should be
done and how they can do it.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.230 align:middle line:84%
- Or it was using sound
technology to create

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:50.040 align:middle line:84%
an anti-gravity field or some
kind of magnetic resonance.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a way that they
had an advanced technology

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to build these temples
and these megaliths.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:01.170 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:07.410 align:middle line:84%
- It might have been sound
or frequency in combination

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:84%
with technology that
at certain frequency

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
would produce
gravitational effects.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.760 align:middle line:84%
- There's no other real
truly scientific explanation

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.580 align:middle line:84%
for how they accomplished
what they accomplished.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
SPEAKER 2: The ultimate
answer has to involve sound.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.370 align:middle line:84%
They must have been able
somehow to put themselves

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:31.950 align:middle line:84%
into some kind of sympathetic
resonance with these materials.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.600 align:middle line:10%
KIMBA AREM: Many
megalithic sites,

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:38.250 align:middle line:10%
including pyramids, the stone
circles, and sacred sites

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:10%
around the world,
are deliberately

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.670 align:middle line:10%
located on Earth energy
lines or nodal points

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:middle line:10%
of this global Earth
frequency grid.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.280 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.440 align:middle line:84%
- These are the points
on the Earth that

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.710 align:middle line:84%
have a particular
power to them, that

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
have a particular
vibrational quality.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And that vibrational quality
is actually the energy quality

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:06.940 align:middle line:84%
of the original unified field,
the singularity state, the one

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:90%
that everything came out of.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:84%
- They seem to be intended
for transmuting or channeling

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.690 align:middle line:84%
the energy for healing
or ceremonial purposes.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.550 align:middle line:84%
- These sacred
power swaps on Earth

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.760 align:middle line:84%
function similar to chakras
or acupuncture points

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.950 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And they will have
the ability to help

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.622 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize energetic
fields and consciousness

00:38:28.622 --> 00:38:29.955 align:middle line:90%
through the energy of that site.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.450 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Jonathan,
it would seem to be

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that sound may very well be one
of the most important aspects

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.582 align:middle line:90%
of human existence.

00:38:40.582 --> 00:38:42.040 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: So I've
been in this field

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:84%
for about 40 years, George, and
I can only agree with you, sir,

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.680 align:middle line:90%
because it is just--

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:53.350 align:middle line:84%
it's extraordinary the more
I'm watching the observing

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.060 align:middle line:84%
from all sorts of
different traditions,

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
scientific or the--

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.540 align:middle line:84%
this is called a Cousteau
archaeology, sound and

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.310 align:middle line:84%
archaeology-- and
we were talking

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:84%
before about acoustic
levitation, which

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.950 align:middle line:90%
has not gone away.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1920s, there
was a fellow in Florida

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.260 align:middle line:84%
who built a thing
called the Coral Castle.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Edward Leedskalnin.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.610 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: And he had these
devices, supposedly.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.910 align:middle line:84%
No one ever saw them, but they
were somehow spiral devices

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that he would hold in his hand
and that worked with some sort

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.320 align:middle line:84%
of phenomena probably of a
electromagnetics or acoustics

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.500 align:middle line:84%
that literally were able to--
he was able to move these

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:90%
gigantic--

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.263 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: By himself.

00:39:36.263 --> 00:39:38.180 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: --buildings and
all that stuff, yeah.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.670 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: And he
once told people he

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.082 align:middle line:84%
knew how the secret of
the pyramids were built.

00:39:42.082 --> 00:39:43.540 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Well, my
question to you--

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about
that one for-- if you

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:84%
knew the secret of how to
do that, would you share it?

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Because there's such
responsibility in that,

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.590 align:middle line:84%
that it's such a great
power that if you

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.240 align:middle line:84%
could levitate and do this
and that, would you share it?

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:10%
How much responsibility
do we have as humans

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:05.830 align:middle line:10%
to basically consciously use
a technology that potentially

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.300 align:middle line:10%
can shift and change molecular
structure and left hand

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.100 align:middle line:10%
objects?

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.900 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: And who would
you share it with?

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.590 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: There you go.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.340 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: That's the big
thing because there

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:16.720 align:middle line:84%
are some that would probably
try to use this technology

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.150 align:middle line:90%
for nefarious purposes.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.660 align:middle line:90%
They always do, Jonathan.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.210 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: They always do, George.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.600 align:middle line:90%
They always do.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.050 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: Best way is my
website healingsounds.com.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.540 align:middle line:10%
Healingsounds.com.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's got a
plethora of everything

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.170 align:middle line:10%
from sonic tools to
information and free downloads

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:42.340 align:middle line:10%
because my purpose is
to help initiate people

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.630 align:middle line:10%
into understanding how sound can
be able to be used for healing

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.890 align:middle line:10%
and transformation.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can use it.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And let's use it to heal
ourselves and heal our planet.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.960 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: And it also heals us
mentally, too, doesn't it?

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:90%
GOLDMAN: At least.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And you heal the body,
you heal the mind.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.810 align:middle line:84%
You heal the mind,
you heal the body.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And we heal the planet,
we heal ourselves.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.240 align:middle line:84%
We heal ourselves,
we heal the planet.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.550 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Jonathan, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.590 align:middle line:84%
GOLDMAN: George, it's
been a real honor.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.705 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, sir.

00:41:12.705 --> 00:41:14.830 align:middle line:10%
GEORGE: Probably one of
the most important programs

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:18.910 align:middle line:10%
we've done, how sound
can [GONGING] heal you.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.380 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
