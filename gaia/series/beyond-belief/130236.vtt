>>GEORGE NOORY: In July
of 1969, two Americans

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:10%
stepped foot on the moon.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:10%
Or did they?

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people have questioned
that possibility, as well.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, you will hear
"Ken's Moon," right here

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:90%

consultant believes

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
the agency is hiding evidence
that aliens live on the moon.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ken Johnston, one of four
civilian astronaut consultant

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.550 align:middle line:84%
pilots from the
Apollo moon program,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:84%
is a retired aerospace
engineer, US Marine,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and NASA whistleblower.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Instead of destroying evidence
of ancient lunar cities,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Ken has been disseminating
his findings online

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and in his book series
entitled "Ken's Moon."

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:10%
He also donated a
trove of evidence

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:10%
to Roswell's International UFO
Museum and Research Center.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%

cover-up, as well as

>>NOORY: Ken, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It's great to have
you as a guest.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN JOHNSTON: Thank
you very much, George.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, you've
done a great job for us

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:84%
on the "Coast to
Coast" radio show,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really looking
forward to this,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and this vital
amount of information

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.440 align:middle line:90%
that you have brought with you.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.606 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: It's about time
to bring it all forward.

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I've kept a lot of it secret
for almost 50 years now.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.097 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a lot of
encouragement, said gotta

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:84%
get it out to the public
to where everybody knows.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm a lot safer.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just so everybody
knows right from the outset,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
you believe that we went
to the moon, correct?

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: There is
no doubt in my mind.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.006 align:middle line:10%
And I guess the
easiest way to say

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:10%
it is where I've had
people that come in that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.978 align:middle line:10%
had the question in their
mind, because they've

00:01:54.978 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:10%
seen fake movies or fake things
about being on the moon--

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Pictures and things.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: --until
they sit down with us

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.846 align:middle line:84%
and look at the hundreds
of thousands of people that

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
were involved in
getting us to the moon,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and look at the actual evidence
and the records and things

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:90%
that I have in my archive.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Then they come to
realize absolutely we

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.861 align:middle line:90%
did go to the moon.

00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:11.818 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, now let's
go back to the beginning

00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:90%
for Ken Johnston.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: All right.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.281 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in the space program?

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Oh,
well, if you don't

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.475 align:middle line:84%
mind if I jump all
the way back, my dad

00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
was a pilot in the World
War II as a bomber pilot,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:90%
and he lost his life there.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The only pictures
I had was of him

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:90%
in his flight suit and things.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to grow up and be
like my dad and become a pilot.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.254 align:middle line:84%
Well, as time went
on and I wound up

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:84%
going to military school and
then off to the Marine Corps,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and then to officer pilot
training in Pensacola,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.164 align:middle line:90%
where I learned to fly.

00:02:36.164 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And then when I finished up
my tour with the Marine Corps,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I went to Houston, where my
brother, Dr. AR Johnston,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
engineers that helped

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:84%
design the lunar
receiving laboratory--

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: --for us, and
the big vacuum chamber.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So he said, come to
Houston, you'll find a job.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Well I went down to
Houston and applied

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
at five of the top
aerospace companies,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.822 align:middle line:84%
and received great offers
to go to work for them.

00:02:56.822 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I went to work for the
Grumman Corporation that

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:90%
built the lunar module.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:90%
That's where we got started.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And in you went.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.462 align:middle line:84%
And then you started evolving
into the program, I guess.

00:03:04.462 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Absolutely.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The-- first of all, we had to
go through all the same training

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.303 align:middle line:84%
courses that the regular
astronauts did, the four of us.

00:03:10.303 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
We were classified as civilian
astronaut consultant pilots.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:84%
We were not NASA
astronauts, but we

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:84%
were the test pilots that tested
the lunar module and the vacuum

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:90%
chamber.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So when we got the
lunar module down there,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
that was our job to do that,
and get it all checked out.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you know people
like Yeager and those folks?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I met
Chuck Yeager once.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I also met Dr. Wernher von
Braun in one of the reviews

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that we have on being
sure all the equipment was

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:90%
ready to go for each test.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what about
the original astronauts?

00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: All seven of them.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.248 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you meet--
you knew them all, huh?

00:03:43.248 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I-- in fact, in
my lunar spacecraft logbook,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
where I kept just like a
regular pilot's logbook,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I kept the signatures of
everyone that I ran into.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm looking
back at that book,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and I've got a little over
72 some odd astronauts that

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:84%
have signed my
logbook in which I

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
have just about all of the
original seven signed it,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always tested
people, younger people,

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:84%
to ask them if they knew who the
original seven astronauts were.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.266 align:middle line:84%
And they can get maybe one or
two names, and then that's it.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I mix them up
sometimes with the second

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.549 align:middle line:90%
group, but you've got--

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's see
if we remember.

00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: OK.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go with--
and you correct me.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Alan Shepard.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Alan Shepard.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: John Glenn.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: John Glenn.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.698 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wally Schirra.

00:04:22.698 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Wally Schirra.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.764 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gus Grissom.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.765 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Gus Grissom.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:26.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scott Carpenter.

00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Uh-huh.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's five.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yep.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.089 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [GROANING]

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Deke Slayton.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Deke Slayton.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: OK.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.267 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And one more.

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Gordon Cooper?

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gordon Cooper.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: There we go.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:90%
We got 'em all.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:90%
All amazing Americans.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.121 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Absolutely.

00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And only thing that I
struggle with a lot,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:84%
because I was the youngest kid
on the block, I was only 26,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and almost all the astronauts
were 10, 15, 20 years older

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:90%
than me.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm getting all
this information out,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately so many of
them are no longer here

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:90%
in the flesh with us.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.146 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I greatly
miss them, but I just

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
find it difficult to
believe that I really

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.173 align:middle line:84%
had the opportunity to work
with all these great people,

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and to do the things that
we did back in those days.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you want
to become an astronaut,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.510 align:middle line:90%
or were you just in training?

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Oh, no, the
moon wasn't my goal.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Mars has always been
my dream and goal.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
The moon, the goal was to
help get us to the moon

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:90%
and get us back.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:84%
For what-- John F
Kennedy, that was

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:90%
the goal for the United States.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So I've been as high,
oh, over 10 miles high,

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
almost suborbital,
but not quite,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and flying in the fastest
thing I ever flew in

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
was an F-4 Phantom when I
was in the Marine Corps.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But the opportunity to actually
go into orbit and go into space

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:84%
has not yet been real--
but I still have goals.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
a goal, your dreams

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:90%
are going to fall apart, but.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you were part of
a program, the Apollo program,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
as well, when the
tragedy occurred.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yes.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, when
we lost three astronauts--

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Right.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in that capsule.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:84%
That put us behind
some time, didn't it?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: It set us
back for about a year.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Now my first cousin,
Dr. Donald Garrett,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
was with the Air
Force as a captain.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the test
pilots for the Air Force

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
with NASA to test the command
module in the vacuum chamber,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
just like my group
tested the lunar module

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:90%
in Chamber B, the small one.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.832 align:middle line:84%
And Donald was at the Cape,
and had just switched--

00:06:18.832 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:84%
set all the switches up
for the plugs out test.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
That's where the spacecraft
is all powered up by itself.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.107 align:middle line:84%
And he actually tapped
Grissom, Chaffee, and White

00:06:26.107 --> 00:06:27.690 align:middle line:84%
on the helmets as
they went in, and he

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:84%
got in his plane flying
back, and he got the word

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
there'd been a fire and
that we'd lost all three.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.165 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- we-- even with
tragedies, we do learn.

00:06:37.165 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We do learn.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: We do learn.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we've had, of
course, two space shuttle

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:90%
tragedies, as well.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yes, we have.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And I played a very
interesting part,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.470 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the
second tragedy, because--

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Columbia.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Uh-huh.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I actually did the testing
of the tile repair kit,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and using a manned
maneuvering unit

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to be able to fly up
close to the shuttle

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and be able to use this putty,
which very-- same consistency

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:90%
as Skippy peanut butter.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But then I have
pictures and reels

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:84%
of showing me fully
suited up with a chain

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
going up two stories high so
I could simulate zero gravity

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.554 align:middle line:90%
on Earth doing tunnel repair.

00:07:16.554 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And they actually carried
the tile repair kits

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.580 align:middle line:90%
on the first three missions.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.943 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: But the
decision was made, well,

00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:25.055 align:middle line:84%
we could save the MMU and
the stuff about 1,500 pounds.

00:07:25.055 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
It's because we're
doing so good.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem,
I think, that we made,

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
is we were so
fortunate and so lucky

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
that we were just thinking,
you know, well, we'll try.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And we--

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'd gotten
a little careless.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: It got careless.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.021 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I knew all of
them except for-- personally,

00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
except for the woman
teacher that was on board.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's always been
very personal because

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:90%
of being involved as I was.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.792 align:middle line:84%
I got to work with each
and every one of them.

00:07:49.792 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, I want to get
into the moon landing with you.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.472 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and I agree
that we landed on the moon.

00:07:55.472 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Absolutely.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.922 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we've had
people on the moon.

00:07:58.922 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot
of skeptics out there

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:90%
who don't think we were there.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So I want to look
at a piece of video

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.364 align:middle line:84%
and have you and I comment
on what we're looking at.

00:08:07.364 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: All right.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
say pictures were faked

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.206 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look at that.

00:08:14.206 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:10%
>>Those photographs
can be demonstrated

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:10%
not to have been taken
on the lunar surface.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.497 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they were not
taken on the lunar surface,

00:08:23.497 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
there's only one other place
they could have been taken,

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:90%
and that's on Earth.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Documentary evidence from all
six of the successful Apollo

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:90%
landings show similar anomalies.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:84%
In some, areas lit
from behind which

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.185 align:middle line:84%
should be in deep shadow are
bright and perfectly visible.

00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:84%
In other pictures, the shadows
are at near right angles,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.506 align:middle line:84%
suggesting two
separate light sources.

00:08:54.506 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps most surprisingly,
there are no stars

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
in the Apollo photographs,
even though they

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.845 align:middle line:90%
were taken from space.

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.070 align:middle line:84%
When the archived
film is sped up,

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:84%
the astronauts appear to
be running at normal speed

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:90%
and terrestrial gravity.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.635 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And why does the flag appear
to be fluttering in a breeze,

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.654 align:middle line:84%
even though there's
no wind on the moon?

00:09:23.654 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Ken, some
of those questions

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.856 align:middle line:90%
seem to be justified, right?

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: On the surface.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
answer some of that?

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:84%
The waving of the
flag, for example.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.646 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, it looked like
it was in a breeze.

00:09:37.646 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Now, you
have to understand

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that the flag had a
bar across the top,

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and it had weights
down at the bottom.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: And also,
on the lunar surface,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:84%
when they're moving,
they're kicking up

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.159 align:middle line:84%
lunar dust that hits the pole
and causes the pole to shake.

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
got the wave in there.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't from air in a
studio or something like that.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the
other ones, where

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:84%
you had that 'C' on
the rock and stuff

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:84%
like that, now we know very
well that the government,

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
anytime that they're going to
do a dangerous situation that

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
might reflect upon
the political machine,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:84%
they're going to put out
a very positive report.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we landed on the moon.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:90%
We did this.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, it was a
terrible tragedy.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.355 align:middle line:90%
So they have a backup.

00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have no
problems with the fact

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle line:84%
that there are some faked
movies or videos of what we did.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.206 align:middle line:84%
But whenever you go and
you look at the moon,

00:10:26.206 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
you look through
Hubble-- and you

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
can do that as
private citizens now,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
they can take time
and use that-- they

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.887 align:middle line:84%
can zoom in on each one
of the landing sites.

00:10:33.887 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's the descent
stage sitting there,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:84%
there are the tracks that we
made on the lunar surface.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:84%
There's the rovers
parked on the moon.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did they get
there if we didn't go?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, people talking about that
stuff don't do their research.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
They just jump on
something for publicity.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I've always
said, re-creation photos--

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yes.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --may have been
mixed in with the originals,

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.585 align:middle line:84%
giving those people the
credence to say we never went.

00:10:58.585 --> 00:10:59.385 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:01.718 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I wasn't aware
of any of them being mixed in

00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
with the originals, because
having the privilege of being

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.724 align:middle line:84%
there at the lunar
receiving laboratory

00:11:05.724 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and working directly
with the photo lab

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to issue the pictures of
samples and in orbit--

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and that brings up the
things about stars.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I actually was
present in the room,

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and seeing
professional strippers,

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:90%
as they call themselves.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:84%
They would take a
photograph, they'd

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
get a positive transparency,
blow it up to 8x10,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and over light tables
they would paint out

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
stars and things,
and/or things that

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:84%
were of controversy
they didn't think

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:84%
that we were old enough or
mature enough to look at.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh?

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Like anomalies?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.124 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Like anomalies.

00:11:38.124 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Like-- and one of the
quickest, easiest ways,

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.019 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking at a picture
of an astronaut on the moon

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and you want to know
if it's been doctored,

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:84%
look for the antenna coming up
from the portable life support

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.066 align:middle line:90%
system on his back.

00:11:49.066 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a very skinny little
antenna sticking up

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
from the right-hand
side of the PLSS.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And if it's painted
out, because you

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
can't paint right up to
the edge of a quarter inch

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.177 align:middle line:84%
or half-inch
diameter antenna, we

00:12:01.177 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:84%
use that a lot when we're going
through my archive of pictures

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:84%
about, whoop, you can see
here they painted out.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And then nowadays, with
the digital things,

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.759 align:middle line:84%
you can look at the different
pixels of how they painted

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:90%
or airbrushed things out.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have
airbrush back then.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Ken, in 1969, in
July, when we land on the moon

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and Armstrong comes out
and Aldrin comes out

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:84%
of the lunar lander,
they talk about seeing--

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
this is what we've
heard-- objects

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of a crater.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:90%
What did they see?

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: And
again, I try to stick

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
with things I have
firsthand information on.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.130 align:middle line:84%
This comes into secondhand
because of an acquaintance

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I had that was at
mission control,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.795 align:middle line:84%
and later was confirmed
by a ham operator that--

00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Someone you trust?

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: I did, yes.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Very much.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:90%
He's not with us anymore.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:84%
He said that-- and I may be
paraphrasing a little bit--

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:84%
the signal came back,
he says, they're here.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:90%
They're watching us.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.155 align:middle line:84%
They're on the
rim of the crater.

00:12:56.155 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But this was after
he-- and I got

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.924 align:middle line:84%
dinged on saying
that he switched

00:12:58.924 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
to the private medical
channel, but in reality

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
the mission director would
tell you, OK, everybody

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:90%
switched off.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And they switch
everybody off, and just

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:84%
allows him to talk directly
with either the medical officer

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
or with the mission
control operator.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:84%
That's how those signals
and the communications

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
happened so that
the masses of people

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
in mission control at the
time weren't privy to that.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Repeat what
you just said about what

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:90%
Armstrong may have said.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Is that they're
here, they're watching us,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
they're on the
rim of the crater.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What could that be?

00:13:29.755 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well, I think Buzz
Aldrin summed it up pretty

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.750 align:middle line:84%
good in his last
statement when he

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:90%
talked about the light craft.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It got pretty close to him
on their way to the moon.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And he says, in
reality, since nobody

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
knew what it was, it is an
unidentified flying object.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
and at that time,

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.400 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have a
lot of paraphernalia

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.484 align:middle line:90%
up there in space, did we?

00:13:51.484 --> 00:13:52.608 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: No, we did not.

00:13:52.608 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:90%
We did not.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.015 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Neil and
Buzz-- shouldn't

00:13:57.015 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
say Buzz-- talked
about this bit,

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
that he and Neil talked
about, well, what can we do?

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
We need to find
out what this is.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.298 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to
tell them that we're

00:14:03.298 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:84%
being followed by
a UFO to the moon,

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:90%
or they'll cancel our mission.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So they chose to
call mission control

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.690 align:middle line:90%
and say, uh, where's the SRB?

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.406 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: It's not a
rocket but-- not a SRB,

00:14:13.406 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:84%
but the main rocket that gave
them the final push to put

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:90%
them--

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That pushed them up

00:14:18.345 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: --in
the trans-lunar--

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Before separate--

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Right.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After it separated.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Right.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was a long pause, and
mission control finally said,

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
it's about so many
thousands of miles

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:84%
away, which means they
couldn't have seen it.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It couldn't
have been that one.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.239 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: But it was their
way of alerting mission control

00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:32.012 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
following them.

00:14:32.012 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it have
been the Russians?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: No.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
The-- yes, they did send craft
to orbit the moon before we

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:90%
did, unmanned.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.689 align:middle line:84%
And then there are some
questions about whether or not

00:14:45.689 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:84%
they actually tried to
get a man on the moon that

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.714 align:middle line:90%
died in the process.

00:14:48.714 --> 00:14:49.630 align:middle line:90%
I've read about those.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've heard
stories about that.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Then again,
it's second, third-hand,

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:90%
so I'm not privy to it for real.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have been told that,
because of that space race,

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and the effort to land
a human on the moon

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:84%
was so intense, that even
we were in a position

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:84%
to land a man on the moon
and not bring him back just

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:90%
to say we did it first.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: That was--

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had you heard that?

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: That was discussed.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:90%
That was discussed.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure we had guys
that were willing to make

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.990 align:middle line:90%
that sacrifice to do it.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The men and later women
that became the astronauts,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:84%
they had the determination
and the intestinal fortitude

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to sacrifice
themselves for our country,

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.725 align:middle line:90%
to keep America great.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I think we've lost
a lot of that.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we sure did.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.616 align:middle line:90%
So in your opinion, Ken,

00:15:38.616 --> 00:15:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yes, sir.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
vast experience,

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
what do you think Armstrong
was making reference to?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.752 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well, the
only-- in my impression,

00:15:49.752 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and from what I've seen
from the anomalies that

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I've discovered on
the lunar surface,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
it had to have been
craft, extraterrestrial.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And I feel very comfortable
in admitting the fact

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.632 align:middle line:84%
that we have been observed
for quite some time.

00:16:03.632 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
were watching us.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: And they
were watching us.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ingo Swann,
the late remote viewer,

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:84%
in a book called "Penetration,"
talked about remote viewing

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:90%
the far side of the moon.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Our government used
him in secret programs,

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:90%
along with his staff.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:27.970 align:middle line:84%
He says in that book that he
saw structures on the moon

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:90%
on the far side.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Right.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Structures by whom?

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: OK, that brings
up a very important point.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:90%
It's in my book.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.734 align:middle line:84%
And I've got the
publicity out right now--

00:16:37.734 --> 00:16:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Ken's
Moon," by the way.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Here you go.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go ahead.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.935 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Doctor
Thornton Page,

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:84%
who was in charge of the
Lunar and Planetary Science

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Department, where visiting
scientists would come and stay

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and work during each mission, he
asked me to check out Apollo 14

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:90%
16-millimeter sequence--

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's Edgar
Mitchell's flight.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Yep, it's Edgar
Mitchell's flight, right.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And set up a private
showing for him

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and six other of the
scientists in a building

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:84%
right next to the
mission control building.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
I did that, where--
I've said it--

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to run those
kind of gun sequence camera

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:84%
projectors, where you can
freeze it, you can zoom in,

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:84%
you can zoom out, you
can go frame at a time.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.584 align:middle line:90%
So it was important to do that.

00:17:17.584 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing this
particular-- I checked it out

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
of bonded storage
at the photo lab,

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.074 align:middle line:84%
set up the cameras and
the gentleman over there,

00:17:25.074 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and I started
showing the picture.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
We're coming around on
the backside of the moon

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:90%
towards Crater Tchaikovsky.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, very quickly, of the
hundreds or even the thousands

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
of craters, why is
this one crater,

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Tchaikovsky get
mentioned so many times

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:90%
if it wasn't important?

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.610 align:middle line:90%
That's just a side point here.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So here we're approaching
Tchaikovsky Crater.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And the sun angle at
the time on the moon

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.218 align:middle line:84%
was like half moon phase,
so half of the crater

00:17:48.218 --> 00:17:49.136 align:middle line:90%
was in shadow.

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But as we're going
there, there's

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:84%
this-- in the shadowed
part of Tchaikovsky

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.445 align:middle line:90%
are these five domes.

00:17:54.445 --> 00:17:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to describe
it is if you take your hand,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:84%
turn it palm up, and bring
your fingers together, and look

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.390 align:middle line:84%
at it from on top, you've
got five little bubbles,

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:90%
or five domes.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of them had a column
or a steam sticking up.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Page had me freeze it,
zoom in, zoom back, freeze it,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%
go in, stop.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he turned
to the other guy

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, boys,
what do you think of that?

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And they all laughed.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:90%
It was an inside joke.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think about that
until years later that Dr.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Page knew exactly what was on
that reel because he had me

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:84%
check out that
specific 15-minute--

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
it look like to you?

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: They--
like glass domes.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And these things would have--
I'm looking at-- no, oh.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I had been unable to prove
that to anybody for decades,

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:84%
until my graphics
illustrator happened

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
to get a hold of a
copy of the reel,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and later a transcribe
of the astronauts

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:90%
talking back and forth.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking, wow,
looking through this section,

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
like wow, look,
there's Tchaikovsky.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and look at that.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.886 align:middle line:84%
It's dark in the crater,
and it's all there.

00:18:57.886 --> 00:18:59.385 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's basically
the transcribe

00:18:59.385 --> 00:19:00.384 align:middle line:90%
of where they're coming.

00:19:00.384 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So what he found is a doctored
picture, or part of the reel,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:84%
of Tchaikovsky Crater
and that shadow.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But by shifting the light with
the modern technology we have,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:90%
it brought up the bubbles.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.679 align:middle line:84%
You can see a-- it had
been painted over, but not

00:19:18.679 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:90%
enough to get rid of all of it.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually see there
are five little points of light

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and this one big glow
in the dark shadow.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So we now have some
proof that what

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:31.824 align:middle line:84%
I had shown to them back
in 19-- mercy, 1970, '71,

00:19:31.824 --> 00:19:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that there was a base
there on the moon.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, since then, we've come up
with an even better-- I mean,

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.207 align:middle line:84%
absolute irrefutable proof
of a base on the moon.

00:19:40.207 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Before we
were capable of it.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let's
talk about this base.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.226 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: All right.

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who put it there?

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Did we put it there in
a past civilization?

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Were we capable
of doing that in 1971?

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were we capable of
doing it a million years ago?

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:90%
What if this planet--

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: That's
a possibility.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if this planet
had incredible technology

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
that somehow got
obliterated, and we have just

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:90%
started over again?

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe we went to the
moon a million years ago.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: There
are ancient texts,

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.724 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Sumerian
texts, the Indian--

00:20:15.724 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That talked
about the flying Vimanas.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Right.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:90%
All of those.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
They talk about
our high technology

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:90%
existence in past times.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying
is a possibility,

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that it could have
been our stuff,

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.614 align:middle line:84%
or the remnants of
our civilization

00:20:30.614 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:84%
from back then that are still
watching how we've recovered

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.070 align:middle line:90%
and where we are now.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.486 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to
blow ourselves up?

00:20:35.486 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to join the
intergalactic federation

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:90%
of sentient beings, if you will.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.215 align:middle line:90%
So it could be.

00:20:43.215 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big
were the structures?

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: OK.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And here's the photo
number, if you-- if anybody

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.020 align:middle line:90%
wants to copy it down.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:55.711 align:middle line:90%
And that's AS15-88-11970.

00:20:55.711 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
That will show you the Apollo
15 command module with the lunar

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.560 align:middle line:90%
surface below it.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.321 align:middle line:84%
And mind you, I had this picture
in my archive for 44 years.

00:21:07.321 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'd only looked
at the command module,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a pilot.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what was important to me.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.126 align:middle line:84%
My artists-- and the people
around here that are artists

00:21:14.126 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:84%
will admit the
fact that they use

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.614 align:middle line:84%
a different part of their
brain to look at things.

00:21:17.614 --> 00:21:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying, no, but look
what's on the lunar surface.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.238 align:middle line:90%
I said, what are you talking?

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:90%
And he has me look at it.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's in my
book, and it's now

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:84%
in the archives at the
Roswell museum, all of it.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
You can-- you look at,
and there's at least

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:84%
a dozen or more domes in
perfect little alignments.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:90%
They're in grids.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:33.510 align:middle line:90%
They're all set up there.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
some larger ones--

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clearly not natural.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Absolutely
not natural.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:37.835 align:middle line:90%
I have geologists--

00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is amazing, Ken.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: And the
nice thing about it

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
is those domes, if you look
at Tchaikovsky is basically

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:84%
24 nautical miles across and
you're looking at these domes,

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and they have to be at least
as big as the Astrodome

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.640 align:middle line:84%
or-- and opaque from being
illuminated from the inside.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.947 align:middle line:90%
So I think we've got the goods.

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:90%
We've got the truth.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
Mars in a second,

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:90%
but this hat fascinates me.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:90%
You're a veteran, of course.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Of course.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A Marine.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:90%
I was in the Navy.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:05.551 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: There you go.

00:22:05.551 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:90%
You got us there.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me tell, you're
proud of this, aren't you?

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Absolutely.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Very proud of it.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.696 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:22:09.696 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.635 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
your service, too.

00:22:14.635 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: My response to that
to other people is I thank them

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
for keeping the lights
burning back at home for us--

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: --because not
everybody had the opportunity

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:90%
to go.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody was qualified.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mars.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.444 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yes, sir.

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now there's talk
of sending humans to Mars.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yes.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On a one-way mission.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Mhm.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:31.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
not coming back.

00:22:31.945 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Right.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
part of that program.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well, I think
the funniest part about it

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.220 align:middle line:84%
is my wife rides a train
from Belen to Santa Fe,

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's a two-hour
trip every day.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And she's listening
to-- on her cell phone

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.250 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and it's talking
about the Mars One corporation

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.570 align:middle line:84%
is looking for people to go
one way to colonize Mars.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Volunteers, right?

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Volunteers.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:90%
One-way.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And she calls me, says,
if you still want to go,

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.615 align:middle line:84%
you'd better get your
application in now.

>>NOORY: She wanted you to go
to a one-way mission to Mars?

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.113 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I jokingly
say my wife signed me

00:23:02.113 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:90%
up to go one way.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:03.770 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Years later-- well, a few
years later-- this was 2014.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And I had three days to
get my application in,

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.070 align:middle line:90%
and a video and the whole bit.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.966 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, they were
just proud as heck

00:23:12.966 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to have me at 70
years old at the time.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.059 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 70 years old,
you applied to go to Mars.

00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: And I was accepted.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:84%
They sent me to Switzerland
and Poland and all

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
over the United States,
places to promote the Mars

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.474 align:middle line:90%
One program.

00:23:24.474 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And all the time, they were
saying we're recruiting people

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:90%
from the ages of 18 to 80.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.635 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was only 70.

00:23:29.635 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you
had 10 years on 'em.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Right.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:10%
And so when they cut the list
down from 202,000 volunteers

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.092 align:middle line:10%
to 11,000 to 1,000
to 700 down to 600.

00:23:39.092 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Finally-- and my name's
right there in the list

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.962 align:middle line:84%
all the way until they
get down to the final 100

00:23:43.962 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:90%
to going to go into training.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:90%
And then my name is dropped.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So I got my friend, and
we went through the list.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:90%
There were none of them over 60.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.370 align:middle line:90%
They were all under 60.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.661 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you disappointed?

00:23:52.661 --> 00:23:55.002 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I was devastated,
because that has happened

00:23:55.002 --> 00:23:56.210 align:middle line:90%
to me three times in my life.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And there-- my
whole life, when you

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.470 align:middle line:84%
go through my autobiography
you'll find out

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:84%
there has to have
been some guidance

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.961 align:middle line:84%
to get me at the various
places and things.

00:24:03.961 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%

of it, Ken, you're 70 years old.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.865 align:middle line:84%
By the time we really get
men and women to Mars--

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I
would have been 80.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'll be
80, 85, 90, who knows.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: But you see, I'm
dyslexic, and I'm only 37 now.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:90%
So I still--

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
see it that way.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: No, they didn't.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.290 align:middle line:90%
No, they didn't.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I can understand
the way they were thinking.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yeah.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:90%
But it--

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
would have gone.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Oh, I was
going-- I will still go.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where would
you have lived?

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:90%
In some kind of bubble?

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: The same
thing that we have--

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would have
been bored out of my mind.

00:24:32.875 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: --on the moon-- same
thing we have on-- well, true.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
But then think, you've
got a whole planet

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:84%
to start exploring
and learning from.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And that gets us into do we
already have bases on Mars?

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we?

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I'm doing
my research right now,

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:90%
getting into it.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.265 align:middle line:84%
And there are many,
many pictures from Mars

00:24:53.265 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:84%
where you can see
where they've smudged

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
out things, where
they've painted over

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:90%
with pixels and things.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And there-- everyone from
President Eisenhower's

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:84%
granddaughters talking
about the fact that of our

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:84%
setting up bases and being
invited to be one of them.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So that wouldn't
surprise me a bit.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would be more
surprised if we don't

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:90%
have our own bases on Mars.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to
take a quick look

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:84%
at a little clip from
the movie "The Martian"

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:84%
just to give us all
a little idea what it

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:90%
would be like living on Mars.

that Matt Damon was on Mars.

He was trapped there.

He could not get back

sent a rescue mission to
him, which takes time.

rescue him, and I'm not

going to tell everybody
the end of the movie,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.526 align:middle line:84%
that 1/3 of Earth's

be a lot different
than what they

were portraying in the

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.690 align:middle line:84%
that on the Martian
surface the equivalent of--

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:84%
is at least being at
150,000 feet altitude.

>>NOORY: So a little
Hollywood in there.

>>JOHNSTON: Oh, a
lot of Hollywood,

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.080 align:middle line:90%
but it was a lot of fun.

>>NOORY: Bottom
line is that there

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
are going to be humans
that will go to Mars

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:90%
that will not come back.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:90%

And with Mars One

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.390 align:middle line:84%
initially they do not want

until we get enough of a colony

they're talking about
when they go in '35, 2035,

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:84%
they want to be able to

past that 100th monkey
thing at any rate,

have a colony capable
of supporting new life.

But then back then, it was
just as much of a chance,

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that they knew they weren't
going to be coming back.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:90%
They were going one way.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a
one-way mission.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.213 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: But it was a lot--
they had a lot more work.

00:28:57.213 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But then again, there's
a lot more on Mars

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.345 align:middle line:90%
than what we've been shown.

00:29:01.345 --> 00:29:02.969 align:middle line:84%
And in a lot of the
pictures and things

00:29:02.969 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that I'm getting from
people, particularly some

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.660 align:middle line:84%
of the vegetation things down
near the south pole of Mars,

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:84%
as well as now NASA admits
that there is flowing

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.940 align:middle line:90%
water, very highly brine.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.756 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a lot
more water on Mars.

00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to have the water
in order to be able to survive.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So we're-- I think we're
getting at the point now where

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:84%
we're ready to go and
start colonizing Mars.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then we'll
Terraform Mars, won't we?

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: That is--

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.171 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll create
an atmosphere, right?

00:29:28.171 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Mars Society
demonstrates that whole plan.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, their flag is red
Mars, green Mars, and blue Mars.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.385 align:middle line:84%
So when Mars is back
with the water--

00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: --lakes and
things-- absolutely.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --everything else.

00:29:40.605 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: So-- so--

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at some pictures, Ken.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna have you explain to
us what we are looking at here.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Ah.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, so what's that?

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: That is the
Apollo 15 command module.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's got its service
module connected to the command

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.190 align:middle line:90%
module pointing straight down.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm explaining this to my
artist friend, Brett Shepard,

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and he on the other side
says, look to the left.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:84%
You see where the little
x is from-- that's

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.430 align:middle line:84%
on the lens of the cameras
taking the pictures.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Look slightly just
below the tip of that x,

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:90%
and you can see an alien base.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was flabbergasted
that I had never seen

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:90%
that in 40-something years.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
I had the pictures

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:84%
in 35-millimeter slides that
were made from the originals

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that I kept in my archive
is the only reason

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.920 align:middle line:90%
you're able to see that today.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you order that
same photo, AS15-88--

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.774 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not there.

00:30:33.774 --> 00:30:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: It's gone.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: It's
been smudged out.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But you can tell
it's been doctored.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.823 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and that brings
up another question, Ken.

00:30:39.823 --> 00:30:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is, why
doctor the photographs?

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.037 align:middle line:84%
Why not say there are
alien bases on the moon?

00:30:46.037 --> 00:30:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well
hopefully, we're at a point

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:90%
now where they can admit that.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:52.405 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that me coming
forward with the archive--

00:30:52.405 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and I've been told that
people says, oh my gosh,

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.660 align:middle line:84%
he does have all
that information.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:84%
They're shocked that I actually
had kept all of this data.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that
they can come forward

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes, we doctored
it because we were told to--

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and this goes all the way back
to President Eisenhower, when

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.930 align:middle line:84%
he requested the Brookings
Institute-- for people who

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.112 align:middle line:84%
don't know, that's like the MIT
is today, it was back then--

00:31:18.112 --> 00:31:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and they were asked
to-- what would

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.090 align:middle line:84%
be the effect on
our society if we

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:84%
were to discover the existence
of extraterrestrial life.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And they came back after
their research, they said,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:33.620 align:middle line:84%
you'll probably find it on Mars,
on the earth, or on the moon.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.690 align:middle line:84%
But you can't make it
public, because the public

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:36.490 align:middle line:90%
can't deal with it.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And I think a perfect example--

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which I think we can.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Well, now we can.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now we can.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: But look what
happened when HG Wells did

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.460 align:middle line:90%
the world on the world--

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People panicked.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: People panicked,
jumped off buildings,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.385 align:middle line:90%
and committed suicide.

00:31:45.385 --> 00:31:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the way
he did it, you know.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yeah.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're coming,
they're taking us, they're--

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: It was
dramatic for the radio.

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was like a war.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Very
dramatic for the radio.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now here's another one.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:55.614 align:middle line:90%
Kind of hard to see here, but--

00:31:55.614 --> 00:31:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well because
that's been blown up a lot.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, people who've gone to the
balloon fiesta, hot air balloon

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.220 align:middle line:84%
fiesta, and they know that
they launched the nitrogen.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And interesting enough, the moon
is flooded with nitrogen 3--

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.130 align:middle line:90%
or helium 3, excuse me.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Helium 3.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you zoom
in like we have here,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that looks like a gondola
balloon of some sort.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But you'll see the cable
connected to the base of it

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:90%
on-- inside this crater.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And it goes up the side of the
wall to the edge of the crater.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And Brett Shepard and I were
studying the original picture

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.490 align:middle line:84%
just two days
before I came here,

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like
the cable actually

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.230 align:middle line:84%
goes into a dark black
area, like it's going

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.780 align:middle line:90%
into a building of some sort.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or a
crevice or something?

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well no, it's
actually a perfect square door

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.030 align:middle line:90%
when you look at it.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's not in
this particular--

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would have launched
that if it was a balloon?

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.154 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well,
either that, or I--

00:32:49.154 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:84%
we're only theorizing,
because we don't know exactly

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.040 align:middle line:90%
what alien technology is.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that
is-- 1/6 of Earth's gravity

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:02.244 align:middle line:84%
is able to form a
balloon-type structure.

00:33:02.244 --> 00:33:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: And that's
just one of them.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
pictures I have

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
where it shows
cables or beams that

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.352 align:middle line:84%
have been dropped along
the side of a mountain,

00:33:11.352 --> 00:33:13.810 align:middle line:84%
curving right along the edge
of the mountain up to the top.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the
actual photograph.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Look at in the middle,
slightly to the bottom.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.960 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the
little bubble there.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the crater that it's
being supported or launched in.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And up against the wall behind
the little bubble-- by the way,

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.360 align:middle line:84%
this was earthrise on
Apollo 15 as they've just

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:84%
fired the engines--
you know, getting

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.119 align:middle line:84%
ready to fire the engines to go
trans earth back to the earth.

00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well what's that on
the right that looks like stars?

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: That's
damage that was

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.510 align:middle line:84%
done to the 35-millimeter
slide sitting

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:44.670 align:middle line:90%
inside a carousel for 40 years.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I originally thought
maybe that was another thing.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Now again, now here
are the-- you have

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.230 align:middle line:90%
the earthrise, which is great.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:56.794 align:middle line:84%
But stars and things that
have already been painted out.

00:33:56.794 --> 00:33:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're
looking at the earth?

00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: You're
looking at the earthrise

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.500 align:middle line:90%
there in the middle.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looks like an
eclipse of the earth, huh?

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well of
course, because that's

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.250 align:middle line:84%
the angle of where the
moon was at that time,

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and the angle of where
the sun was with respect

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.719 align:middle line:90%
to the earth and the moon.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So the earth-- from the moon,
the earth goes through phases,

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.290 align:middle line:90%
just like the moon does for us.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, now--

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, here we are.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.911 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: This is a good one.

00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Notice that you see
his antenna sticking up

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.615 align:middle line:84%
on his left side of his
portable life support system.

00:34:24.615 --> 00:34:25.489 align:middle line:90%
That's the key there.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:90%
That's still there.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Look up above, and
you'll see there-- now,

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.940 align:middle line:84%
if you analyze the actual
photographs that I have,

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.787 align:middle line:84%
the originals-- not in that
one, excuse me, but one of it,

00:34:35.787 --> 00:34:38.120 align:middle line:84%
you can see where they painted
out all the stars around,

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.659 align:middle line:84%
but they actually--
some of the people who

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
were tasked with painting out
things on the horizon, things

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.880 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want
us to see obviously

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.834 align:middle line:84%
felt like they needed
to let stuff slip

00:34:47.834 --> 00:34:50.250 align:middle line:84%
or come through, because we're
finding evidence where they

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.030 align:middle line:84%
either very lightly brushed
over things or, in this case,

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.630 align:middle line:84%
painted all the way around
that particular thing that's

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.884 align:middle line:84%
up in the horizon-- up in
the sky, the lunar sky.

00:34:58.884 --> 00:35:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those two little
dots you're talking about?

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: It's actually--
it's a whole cluster.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And it looks a lot
like-- my editor

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.012 align:middle line:84%
says it looks like
the original Star Trek

00:35:08.012 --> 00:35:09.470 align:middle line:84%
movie, "The Trouble
with Tribbles,"

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:84%
their little space station,
when you look at that,

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.440 align:middle line:84%
it looks exactly like an alien
space station that is there.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have found that same
image in other pictures

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.960 align:middle line:90%
in my archive.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, if these are real,
these anomalies that we see out

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: OK.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to me,
the moon then must be

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:90%
teeming with things like that.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Was it a little more capable
of supporting life or something

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.100 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago?

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Because it's pretty barren.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Why would you set up
a base on the moon

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.200 align:middle line:90%
when you're so close to Earth?

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:90%
What's there?

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.953 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well,
we know that there's

00:35:52.953 --> 00:35:55.910 align:middle line:84%
water on the moon in the
south polar region area in one

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:56.900 align:middle line:90%
of the craters.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So we know there was water
on the moon at one time.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.884 align:middle line:84%
I've had discussions with people
talking about-- particularly

00:36:03.884 --> 00:36:06.050 align:middle line:84%
when we first started sending
satellites to the moon

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and they would go
behind the moon

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.789 align:middle line:84%
and they would show up coming
on the other side not where we

00:36:09.789 --> 00:36:11.590 align:middle line:90%
expected them to show up.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And part of that was what
they called mass cons,

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:90%
mass concentration of metals.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we-- once
we would land on the moon

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and we would launch
the command--

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.769 align:middle line:84%
the lunar module to
come back in orbit,

00:36:26.769 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:84%
once we finished transferring
everything in the command

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.250 align:middle line:84%
module, we would
fire the rockets

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.083 align:middle line:84%
and cause the lunar
module to come back down

00:36:32.083 --> 00:36:33.430 align:middle line:90%
and impact on the moon.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:36.530 align:middle line:84%
When we did that, we
had seismic equipment

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.052 align:middle line:84%
set out in the [INAUDIBLE]
lunar surface [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:39.052 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of
pinged, didn't it?

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.466 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Oh, it
rang for six days.

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a bell.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Like a bell.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So which brings people to say,
well, an awful lot of the moon

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:90%
has to be hollow.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And the moon is an
anomaly in itself,

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.080 align:middle line:84%
being so large for
such a small planet.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest planetary
moon, if you will,

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.090 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people say
it was towed into place.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.325 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: This is
another theory possibility.

00:37:04.325 --> 00:37:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: So there
may well be some ability

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.324 align:middle line:84%
to survive a lot better
than what we had to do.

00:37:09.324 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have some
e-mails in here for you.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Oh, good.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.584 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason from West
Palm Beach, Florida.

00:37:13.584 --> 00:37:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Was there ever a point where
you feared for your own life

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.391 align:middle line:90%
in the space program?

00:37:19.391 --> 00:37:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Just very shortly.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And this was after 1995,
when there was a group of us

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:27.770 align:middle line:90%
at Boeing.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Now mind you, we didn't
have e-mails and things

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.805 align:middle line:84%
We had inter-office
mail envelopes.

00:37:31.805 --> 00:37:34.111 align:middle line:84%
And we called ourselves
the majestic 12.

00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
we got that name.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But what we would do is anyone
were to pick up any newspaper

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:84%
article or a thing having
to do with UFOs [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:44.360 align:middle line:84%
we'd send everybody in our
little group a copy of it.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, by that we also
would review various books

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:50.770 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:84%
There was a book that came
out on monuments on Mars.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And the gentleman who
wrote that, Mr. Rich C.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Hoagland was at Seattle.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And now I was a 737 flight
instructor at the time,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have a flight
training that night.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So one of my friends
called me, says, hey,

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.215 align:middle line:84%
Richard's going to be
down at the coliseum.

00:38:09.215 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you go down
there and see him

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:90%
and get your book autographed.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And I always like to get the
book autographed by the author.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: I went
down and I thought,

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.140 align:middle line:84%
well, I better-- because
he'd been asking,

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.931 align:middle line:84%
there are bound to be
people out there that

00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:22.860 align:middle line:84%
have saved data and records
and pictures and things

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.510 align:middle line:84%
that they need to come
forward before they're gone.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I took that
as an invitation.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote up a little
letter, I have this, that,

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.838 align:middle line:84%
Went into there and walked
up to the desk where

00:38:31.838 --> 00:38:34.110 align:middle line:84%
the ladies were and
I said, oh, here's

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.310 align:middle line:84%
a letter for Mr. Hoagland
She's reading the letter,

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.386 align:middle line:84%
she looks at me, and
she says, you're just

00:38:38.386 --> 00:38:39.510 align:middle line:90%
who we've been looking for.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.839 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
uh-oh, I'm in trouble.

00:38:41.839 --> 00:38:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So in a couple
minutes, he comes back

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and he says-- he looks
at it and he says,

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.400 align:middle line:90%
come and sit in the front row.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
they came to my house

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.491 align:middle line:84%
and started going
through my archive.

00:38:49.491 --> 00:38:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And my archive
became the control,

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.540 align:middle line:84%
because mine were originals
off the original negatives.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And he would get letters and
things like that from people

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.250 align:middle line:84%
asking questions
and saying, well,

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.850 align:middle line:84%
look at this picture
I got from NASA.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:02.770 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And they would compare it
to mine and they'd say,

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.690 align:middle line:84%
well, yeah, there's something
there, or no, it's not.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did you
decide to come forward?

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Because so many of
my friends and acquaintance--

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:84%
as I said, I was the youngest
of all of the civilian astronaut

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.652 align:middle line:84%
consultant pilots,
test pilot types,

00:39:17.652 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:84%
although I didn't go
through test pilot school,

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.100 align:middle line:90%
but we were civilians.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And so many of them have died
that I know had information.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Bill [? Pollack ?]
was one that I

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:31.050 align:middle line:84%
think was fascinating,
that he was

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:34.920 align:middle line:84%
involved in putting in the
security system at Dulce.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And he came forward and did
a couple interviews on it.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So I got to worrying about
I don't want anything

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.560 align:middle line:90%
to die with me.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.269 align:middle line:84%
And when I say this, and since
Hoagland and his team and all

00:39:46.269 --> 00:39:48.560 align:middle line:84%
started talking about how
important it was that we keep

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.540 align:middle line:84%
it-- get it public as quick
as we could before something

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.260 align:middle line:84%
could happen to
me, so they set up

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and had me go to Washington,
DC, and speak before the world

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.260 align:middle line:90%
press.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think the last time
was in 2007, which was

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.920 align:middle line:90%
the second time we did that.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.711 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that
was an exciting thing,

00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:07.650 align:middle line:90%
because they set me up.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.370 align:middle line:84%
After we did the
press conference,

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.590 align:middle line:84%
they took me over to
the Smithsonian Museum.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm giving a talk,
going by the giant mural.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.480 align:middle line:84%
We've gone from
cave mens to flying

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.340 align:middle line:84%
by airplanes for the first, to
rockets and going to the moon.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And around the corner, there it
sets-- LTA8, lunar test article

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:25.840 align:middle line:90%
number eight.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.240 align:middle line:84%
My spacecraft that I
have over 3,000 hours

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.840 align:middle line:84%
testing in it sitting in
the-- And all of a sudden,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.090 align:middle line:90%
it just, like, threw a switch.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going around telling
what everything is on it.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's about 50 people
in the museum crowding,

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.460 align:middle line:84%
following the
photographer that's

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.626 align:middle line:90%
videotaping the whole thing.

00:40:39.626 --> 00:40:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So it was fascinating
to be able to do that.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, people
have come after me.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But what they do is, if
they can't-- if they can't--

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't shoot
holes through you, can they?

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: They can't shoot
holes through the truth,

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.450 align:middle line:84%
so they go shooting
at the individual.

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, he was never there.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.716 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK, here's the phonebook.

00:40:56.716 --> 00:40:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Here's the directory.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, he didn't do this.

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.390 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't a lunar-- well
here's from the director, Brian

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:02.170 align:middle line:90%
[? Erb, ?] the director there.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.420 align:middle line:90%
And he's accommodating me.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Here they gave me $1,000
bonus for doing this.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.220 align:middle line:90%
You know, you can't fight truth.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, I see you
dressed up in official garb.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.780 align:middle line:90%
You were there.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.655 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yes, sir.

00:41:15.655 --> 00:41:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
a witness to this.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: That's true.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if I'm wrong,
and if you're wrong,

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:22.380 align:middle line:84%
we need to cart
you away somewhere

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.550 align:middle line:90%
and put you in a home.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.935 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Well, I'll
save a room next to you.

00:41:26.935 --> 00:41:27.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: That's amazing.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One more
e-mail here for us.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's from Shelley
from Ogden, Utah.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.280 align:middle line:84%
She says, was there
anyone else that

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.870 align:middle line:84%
knew you had all the data
when you decided to go public?

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: The only person
knew was my wife, and my two

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:44.800 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she was
supportive of all this?

00:41:46.125 --> 00:41:46.925 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yes.

00:41:46.925 --> 00:41:49.720 align:middle line:84%
She's-- fact, at that, in the
book you'll find while we were

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.719 align:middle line:84%
looking at other pictures,
she said, by the way,

00:41:51.719 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:84%
what is this that's reflected
in the astronaut's visor?

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: And that
became the key there.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:01.660 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know what
NASA didn't want you to see,

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
look in the visor of the
one being photographed.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.106 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll
see-- in the visor,

00:42:05.106 --> 00:42:07.726 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the astronaut taking
the picture in the back of it,

00:42:07.726 --> 00:42:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and anything that's
in horizon up there

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.850 align:middle line:84%
they didn't paint out, because
it's reflecting in his visor.

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, she's been
supportive all the way.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And we've had moments when we
were concerned when they've

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:22.970 align:middle line:84%
come after me, attacking me
personally, my life, my career,

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:23.890 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And all we do is-- I
don't do it anymore.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't even play the
game with the attack

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.720 align:middle line:84%
dogs, the people that go
out after you, because I

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.557 align:middle line:90%
don't have to.

00:42:32.557 --> 00:42:34.890 align:middle line:84%
There are enough people that
have seen all the evidence,

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.580 align:middle line:90%
and they go out after them.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'll let them do the work.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, if we're
being visited, where do you

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.804 align:middle line:90%
think they're coming from?

00:42:42.804 --> 00:42:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: You've touched
on it a little bit.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It could be ourselves
coming back.

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
just pure theory.

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I have studied a lot of Dr.
Zecharia Sitchin's works,

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and I have a doctorate
degree in theology.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've studied almost all the
major religions in the world.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And I can see where, if you
take the different religions

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and you look at how they
could claim we were formed,

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the ancient
Sumerian texts as well as

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.790 align:middle line:90%
the Indians, we are the aliens.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:16.590 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:17.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are the aliens.

00:43:17.715 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Our DNA
has been manipulated.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to believe
that very strongly,

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that we were part of
what was evolving,

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.040 align:middle line:84%
if you want to use evolving,
here on this planet

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.290 align:middle line:84%
until it became necessary
to tweak our DNA.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:37.954 align:middle line:90%
And I'm comfortable.

00:43:37.954 --> 00:43:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm comfortable with coming
forward and saying that.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the theories
are it could have been us--

00:43:44.945 --> 00:43:45.745 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Yeah.

00:43:45.745 --> 00:43:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could
be extraterrestrials

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.510 align:middle line:90%
from other planetary systems.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They could be coming
from other universes.

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.052 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: True.

00:43:54.052 --> 00:43:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be
all of the above.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: And probably is a
combination of all the above.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do people
get the book "Ken's Moon?"

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Oh, it just
came out two days ago.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.720 align:middle line:10%
You can go to
KenJohnstonMedia.com--

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Spell that
name for us, Ken.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.535 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHNSTON: Ken, K-E-N,
J-O-H-N-S-T-O-N, media.

00:44:12.535 --> 00:44:14.044 align:middle line:90%
M-E-D-- there.

00:44:14.044 --> 00:44:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Oh, what's the big one where
you order books all the time?

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazon.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Amazon.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.130 align:middle line:90%
It's on Amazon.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: In fact, that it
came out just two days ago

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and they've already
sold 10 of them.

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So I guess the
word's getting out.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Ken, in your opinion, is
there a secret space program?

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: The
short answer is yes.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:36.994 align:middle line:84%
And I think the evidence is
in the film and the pictures

00:44:36.994 --> 00:44:39.160 align:middle line:84%
coming back from Mars where
you can see that they've

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160 align:middle line:90%
gone in and brushed out.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are a few
that they have missed.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, my graphics
illustrator, Brett Shepard,

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:90%
has those.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're-- he's coming out now
with a publication of his own

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.120 align:middle line:90%
soon which will show that.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't you think
it's foolish on their part

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:54.074 align:middle line:90%
to hide these things?

00:44:54.074 --> 00:44:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: It is now.

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Because like
[? low in ?] the moon,

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.470 align:middle line:84%
you've got Hubble
looking at it there.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:00.928 align:middle line:84%
And we've got people all over
the earth watching everything

00:45:00.928 --> 00:45:02.870 align:middle line:90%
transmitted back from Mars.

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:05.400 align:middle line:84%
The biggest problem we
have right now with ISS

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.246 align:middle line:84%
is that the government
tries to cancel our-- turn

00:45:08.246 --> 00:45:10.620 align:middle line:84%
off the switch so we don't
get the direct feed every time

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.690 align:middle line:84%
something comes close to
the space station up there.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:16.890 align:middle line:84%
There is so much happening
that it's almost impossible

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.840 align:middle line:90%
to keep the cat in the bag.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion, why
did the Soviets, the Russians,

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:84%
stop their program after being
so aggressive in the beginning?

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSTON: Because--
well, I think

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.910 align:middle line:84%
it is because once
you've lost the race

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the
whole economy that they

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:84%
had to try to do and keep
up with our kind of economy,

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:45.364 align:middle line:84%
it was just totally destructive
to their whole structure.

00:45:45.364 --> 00:45:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, thanks for
being on the program.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.363 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Real pleasure.

00:45:48.363 --> 00:45:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And more importantly,
thanks for coming forward

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.054 align:middle line:90%
with this information.

00:45:52.054 --> 00:45:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSTON: Thank you.

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:56.310 align:middle line:10%
Might say, the other people
out there, get it forward.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:57.110 align:middle line:90%
The time is now.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.210 align:middle line:84%
It's time for the
self-disclosure.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:00.550 align:middle line:90%
People are ready for it.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's make it happen.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We call the program
"Beyond Belief" because

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.320 align:middle line:10%
of people like Ken
Johnston, who come forward

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.900 align:middle line:10%
with information that
truly is out of this world.

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.220 align:middle line:90%
