00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.600 align:middle line:10%
Kimo Kepano is back with us,
a Hawaiian high seer, also

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:10%
known as the light seer.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, he works with the
visualization of the quantum

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.120 align:middle line:90%
field and frequency.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:84%
He tunes into timelines,
helps to heal the body,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and activates your innate
frequency intuitions

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:90%
through higher education.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Kimo, welcome back.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KIMO KEPANO: Mahalo, George.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.738 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for having
me back again.

00:00:42.738 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly
is a Hawaiian seer?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: What is that?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:10%
If we look at the
old ancient belief

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:10%
systems from our prophets--

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:10%
Hawaiians would
call that makaula--

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:10%
all of our chiefs used
to have a seer that

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:10%
was connected to
them to really help

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.950 align:middle line:10%
them see in foresight plans,
health, and things like that.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
And as a kid, I thought
I was just a clairvoyant.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But I realized now,
as I was growing up

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and my abilities
are really igniting,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that my ability to see in the
quantum field and my ability

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.350 align:middle line:84%
to see spirit energy, my
ability to see frequency,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and my ability to see
within the human biofield

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:84%
was really a culmination
of multiple things, which

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:84%
would then equate to help
me understand how am I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
a high seer, the ability to see
everything all at the same time.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Not at the same
time, really trying

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.708 align:middle line:84%
to decide, what
kind of sight do I

00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
want to be working with when
I'm working with a client?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm doing healing
stuff, I put on that filter.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:84%
If I'm doing spirit stuff,
then I put on that filter.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:84%
If I'm doing work
with land energy,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.088 align:middle line:90%
then I'll put on that filter.

00:01:43.088 --> 00:01:45.755 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really trying to take all
the different things that I can

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:90%
see and compartmentalize it.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.388 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
born with a gift?

00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:49.818 align:middle line:90%
Or did you develop the gift?

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, it's
a family joke, George.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.652 align:middle line:84%
So my brother has always
joked that I was dropped

00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:90%
on my head, which I was.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:90%
I was dropped on my head--

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: When I
was two weeks old,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I was dropped on my head
in the Honolulu airport.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And it fractured my skull
and actually fractured

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%
the very back of my occipital.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're lucky you
didn't have any brain damage.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, that's
the joke, right?

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.312 align:middle line:84%
So when I was dropped on
my head at two weeks old,

00:02:10.312 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that actually pushed into
my primary visual center

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and then bruised a little
bit of my visual association

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
center, which is where people
start to be able to identify

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:90%
an apple is an apple.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:90%
A ball is a ball.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But for me now, when I
take a look at the world,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:84%
instead of that being bruised,
it's the ability to see

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:84%
but what is outside of
that energetic zone.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So the joke is I was
dropped on my head,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:90%
but maybe it's my origin story.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's my Peter Parker
Spider Man origin story.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what is
clairvoyance to you?

00:02:38.378 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Clairvoyance
for me-- and the way

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
that I educate this is a little
bit different or a lot different

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
than the way that
we tend to teach it.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Clairvoyancy, many
people believe,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
is a gift and the
ability to see spirit.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't talk about it
that way because I believe

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:90%
that everyone has the ability.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Clairvoyancy is the ability to
see in foresight and trajectory,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:84%
to be able to really
stimulate your mind's eye,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to create here,
to be able to see out there.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of us have access
to that, not just in spirit.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a
type of intuition?

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, it is
a type of intuition.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:84%
We have so many different types
of intuitions that are sensory,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
but we also have intuitions
that are frequency based.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And technically, clairvoyancy
can be frequency based.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:90%
And we all have access to that.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what do you
mean by frequency based?

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: When I
look at how someone

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
might be intuitive-- let's
just say that we're working

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
with someone who views
themselves as very

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
claircognizant, the
ability to know.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, cognition
looks like something

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:90%
in the energetic fields.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
It actually visually looks like
something around the human body.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:90%
And clairvoyancy does that.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Clairsentience does that.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
They all have their
own visualizations.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's how I look
at it with the quantum field.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So if I can pinpoint
what kind of frequency

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
every single person
innately works

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.660 align:middle line:84%
with, it helps me identify,
well, let's exercise this more.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring this
one back to life.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's fertilize this
one to really help

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
you identify what
is unique to the way

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:90%
that you work with energy.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And everyone does it regardless
if we know it or not.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kimo, if you're
good with clairvoyance,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:84%
are you necessarily good
with claircognizance

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:90%
or clairaudience?

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So the awesome thing
about frequency

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:90%
is they love to work together.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
with clairvoyance,

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:84%
it'll work in tandem
with my ability to know.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Or clairaudient
abilities-- I hear it.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes for children,
it goes, I see it.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:90%
I hear it, or I see it.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of them work
in tandem, and learning

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:84%
how to work with
them specifically

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:90%
is really, really helpful.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how can
you, with your abilities,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.620 align:middle line:90%
see if somebody is clairvoyant?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.148 align:middle line:84%
KEPANO: When I look at
the actual frequency

00:04:46.148 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:84%
of clairvoyance, I'm
just going to describe

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.023 align:middle line:90%
what it looks like for me.

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
When I see another clairvoyant
individual, a child

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
or an adolescent or
an adult, it looks

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:84%
like these really
interesting rings

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
that kind of move around this
whole entire part of the body.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.155 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it looks
like a little bit

00:05:00.155 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
of a wave that moves from
the very top of the crown

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:84%
into the pineal,
moves out this way.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.707 align:middle line:84%
And there's very
specific colors that

00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
come in when I take a
look at it from there.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So it helps me identify, ah, I'm
working with the clairvoyant,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
or maybe I'm working
with a clairaudient.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anybody ever say you
look like the late comedian

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Gilbert Gottfried?

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: (MIMICKING GILBERT
GOTTFRIED) If I talk like this.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
that as a compliment.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.804 align:middle line:90%
I used to love Gilbert.

00:05:23.804 --> 00:05:25.096 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have similarities.

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: That's a compliment.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.338 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to have to
really bring my consciousness

00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
back to awareness
because I'm going to want

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.255 align:middle line:90%
to laugh just like him now.

00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:35.963 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do your
clients come to you?

00:05:35.963 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, I believe
that my clients find me

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
because they are in alignment to
looking for that kind of work.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I have clients who are
themselves practitioners.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I have clients who
are very, very sick.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I have clients that
have been diagnosed

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:84%
with strange, anomalous
things that the doctor doesn't

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:90%
know how to make sense of.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:84%
I have clients who are
children and clients who

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:90%
are grandparents.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge diaspora
of how my clients find me.

>>NOORY: How does
clairvoyance tie into healing?

00:06:04.803 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: For me,
George, when I'm

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
looking at someone
who's maybe diagnosed

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
anomalous malady,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:84%
if I look at the frequencies
that move within the body,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
it'll help me identify, well,
where is that moving toward?

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.167 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it moves within
the enteric nervous system.

00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I can see
something around the knee

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
or maybe the cells that
are not moving as well

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and the very bottom of the
left arch of your foot.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.328 align:middle line:84%
So being able to tune in to
how frequency shifts helps

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:84%
me identify, well, what is going
on in that part of the body?

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see
trauma and things

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:90%
like that within the body?

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, so trauma is
a really interesting thing.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:84%
We have our
environmental traumas.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
An air conditioner
fell on my head.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
We have our
environmental traumas,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:84%
but we also have our
emotional traumas.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And emotional trauma
does hold a residual zone

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:90%
inside of the body.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could be worse
than a physical trauma.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I believe that it's
actually much worse than that,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.140 align:middle line:84%
because when we take a look
at the parallel of really

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:84%
massive things like cancer
or some kind of major bone

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.030 align:middle line:84%
degeneration or
something like that,

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
it will be an equilibrium
to some kind of trauma

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.315 align:middle line:90%
within the emotional body.

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.590 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip of you
describing how you see

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.030 align:middle line:90%
emotional trauma in the body.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:84%
- If we're having a
conversation and if I'm

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
looking at your body and
the colors within the body,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and you say something to me
that is based on old trauma,

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
a different part of your body
is going to literally flare up.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And it'll show me
a different color.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I say,
are you interested

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:84%
in me going a little bit further
and doing some color work?

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you say yes, I will say
your left hip just flared up.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say, well,
what do you mean?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And I say, technically,
your left hip is flared up.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:48.947 align:middle line:90%
It's in this position.

00:07:48.947 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
It's connecting
to this vertebrae.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
person will say,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:84%
whoa, OK, yeah, that is
actually very, very true for me.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.930 align:middle line:90%
But how did you see it?

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And my response is, I don't
look for that in the body.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
What I'm looking for is where
emotional energy is stagnant.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Where emotional energy
is stagnant will also

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
ruminate in different parts of
the body, which then tell me

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
something is going on in
that part of the body, which

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:90%
is why I say what I say.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:90%
I said what I said.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So because this is
my identification

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:84%
of how I do medical
work through color work,

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:84%
we're going to learn
some of my own process.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kimo, you have a gift.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, I
have an ability.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:84%
I think that we
all have abilities.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.303 align:middle line:84%
And I really strive
to not call it

00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:36.720 align:middle line:84%
a gift because I
don't want anyone

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to feel like I am more unique or
more special than anyone else.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I know that I
can see what I see,

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:10%
and I know that I'm
helpful to the collective

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:10%
and helpful to clients.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.985 align:middle line:84%
But all of us have
access to that.

00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
There's no
gatekeeping with that.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.527 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about anxiety.

00:08:50.527 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Is there any tie-in there?

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: There is.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So when we take a look at
how clairvoyancy manifests

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:84%
very naturally, which is my
ability to see myself accomplish

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:84%
something easily
in my mind's eye,

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:84%
anxiety manifests as the lack
of seeing myself accomplish it

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:90%
clearly.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I have anxiety in traffic.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
My anxiety is I don't
see myself getting

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:90%
to my destination in time.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't see myself
driving clearly.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So it does affect the way
that we experience anxiety.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that some
people who have clairvoyance

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:90%
try to hide it?

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, I do.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes it's
conscious hiding,

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it's
unconscious hiding.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:10%
There will be many
individuals who

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:10%
will catch visual
glimpses of things

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.803 align:middle line:10%
in the corner of
their eye, maybe

00:09:35.803 --> 00:09:37.470 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of a
movement of something,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.472 align:middle line:10%
maybe something a little
bit of a shadow moved

00:09:39.472 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:10%
into the corner of their eye.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And they just want to
shut all that down.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:84%
They want to put their
head underneath the covers.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And what ends up happening
then is the body then

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:90%
starts to experience fear.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And then once you put
the fear filter on,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard to
see anything clearly.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we pass it
down to our children?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I have seen
that clairvoyancy-- well,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:90%
all of our abilities.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Our abilities can be
passed down generationally.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.980 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
certain individuals

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
who it is just innate
to who they are.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It is just innate
to their system,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.363 align:middle line:90%
innate to their frequency.

00:10:10.363 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
But there's lots of-- because
work with a lot of children.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:84%
There will be many children
who will reflect something

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.482 align:middle line:84%
that the parent did, but the
parent wasn't activating it.

00:10:18.482 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It was natural to the parent.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they turned it
off, but then the child

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:90%
is being then given the ability.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe even the grandparent,
skipped the parent,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.800 align:middle line:90%
went right to the grandchild.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it is genetic.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.307 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: It can be genetic.

00:10:29.307 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
that it's always genetic

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.223 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want us
to ever lean into the fact

00:10:33.223 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
that, well, maybe I can't do it
then because we can access it.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
But there are many, many
individuals where it does move

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:90%
through the generational lines.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about empathy.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Empathy-- if you look
at empathy on a frequency level,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:84%
empathy is this
really interesting,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:90%
full-bodied vibration.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And you would think that empathy
kind of ruminates from the mind,

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:84%
in my conscious ability to
feel someone else's feelings.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And it does happen there
with your mirrored neurons.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
But empathy actually exudes
from the heart center.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm taking
a look at that,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.720 align:middle line:84%
you can tell if someone is
more of an emotional empath

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.630 align:middle line:84%
or a physical empath
or a delayed empath--

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a neurotic mess.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Or a mess.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Or they're doing too much
absorption of empathy,

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
taking on too many different
emotions from the people

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
in their room, from their
family, from their children,

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:90%
from their boss.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And that can affect that
energetic frequency.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a clip of
you talking about empathy.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.433 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:11:28.433 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.190 align:middle line:84%
- Let's talk about what the
visual vibration of empathy

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:90%
looks like.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The visual vibration
of empathy is actually

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:90%
a full-bodied vibration.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Unlike cognizance,
which goes this way,

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and aliens, which goes
this way, and avoidance

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.270 align:middle line:84%
that goes this way, empathy
is a full-body vibration.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
quite oval looking.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:84%
It goes around the
whole entire body,

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.973 align:middle line:84%
from the very base
of my root system,

00:11:53.973 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
my feet, all the way

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
to the very top of my crown,
around the whole entire body.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
The color of this vibration,
you would probably

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
think that it's like
rainbow or bright.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Empathy vibration doesn't
look like that for me.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Empathy vibration is actually
a very misty gray color,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
very, very gray, almost as if
it's like an in-between color.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And then it takes on the
color of the individuals that

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:84%
are around you or the
color of the emotions

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:90%
that are going around.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:90%
So it has a base color.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:84%
When I'm taking a
look at someone,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I'll take a look at what
kind of an empath are you.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%
How do I know what
kind of an empath

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:84%
you are before you
say a word to me?

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll look at what that
full-body vibration does.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'll look at how it
moves, how it pulses.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
If there's little
dents in the vibration,

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:84%
if it's expanding more
one side, a lot of people

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
will thin it out
to the very front

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and then let it grow big
in the very, very back.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:84%
There's different forms
and variations on that.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to go
into an explanation of what

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:90%
all those variations are.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:84%
The explanation of this,
I don't have any time

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to go through when
I do social media.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting a
further explanation

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
of what those different
things are, and I

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
hope that you'll identify,
hmm, I do that one a lot.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Or I've done that one
a lot, or I can see

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:90%
myself having done that one.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.622 align:middle line:90%
I try not to do that one.

00:13:15.622 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:90%
That one sounds just like me.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I want you to utilize
this terminology

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:84%
so you can begin to identify
in your consciousness

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
how to create a
pivot to your change,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.460 align:middle line:90%
a pivot to your paradigm, OK?

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
categorize clairvoyance

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:90%
compared to the supernatural?

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, in
essence, clairvoyancy

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:90%
is very supernatural.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:84%
But I like to change that word
a little bit because we think

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.160 align:middle line:84%
of supernatural as my
ability to levitate

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
things, my ability to
move things kinetically,

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
which can actually
very, very much happen.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To call up spirits.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But when we take a look at how
clairvoyancy is innate to all

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:90%
of us, those two things is a--

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a commonality there
because clairvoyancy, it

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is an expanded ability when
you're really leaning into it.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, it is a
supernatural thing for you.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.473 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it paranormal?

00:14:05.473 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Well, it could be.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you could
see paranormal activity.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
You could see paranormal
motion of things going on.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
When I do paranormal
work and they

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.967 align:middle line:84%
go in with all of their gadgets
that they're working with,

00:14:16.967 --> 00:14:18.467 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to go
in with anything.

00:14:18.467 --> 00:14:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I like to go in and
just see what I can see

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:90%
in terms of a frequency shift.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And those two things
actually have commonality.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
When a temperature
drops, temperature drop

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:90%
is a very visual thing.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:84%
The actual viscosity of
the frequency changes

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.015 align:middle line:90%
around furniture--

00:14:31.015 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
downside to clairvoyance?

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, can it be demonic?

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well,
there is a downside.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:10%
And the downside is what
happens when we become fearful.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And "demon" is such an
interesting word because demon

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.830 align:middle line:90%
is one of those things--

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:90%
I get told this a lot.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you see is very, very
demonic and be very careful.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that
because the visualization

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
of how things appear,
whether that is trauma based

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:84%
or my emotions are dropped
as a visualization.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it is
misinterpreted as what

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.620 align:middle line:90%
would be called demonic.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The ability to see
spirit, the ability

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.020 align:middle line:84%
to see in foresight, the ability
to see within the human biofield

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:84%
could be seen as demonic if we
don't understand that we all

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:90%
have access to this.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned
earlier that some clairvoyant

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:84%
experts see strange shadows
and things whooshing by.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.232 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they
be the shadow person?

00:15:21.232 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, when it
comes to shadow people,

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:90%
here's how I educate about that.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.590 align:middle line:10%
When you're looking at what
we view as shadow-like,

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.080 align:middle line:10%
our human brains
are trying so hard

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:10%
to make sense of all the
things around us, George.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So I might see a frequency of
someone's dropped emotions.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say that Kimo
had a really bad day.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
upset and depressed.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And if I brought that
energy into the space,

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
when I leave this
chair, a clairvoyant

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:84%
might still sense
some of my energy

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:84%
that is still left
in that space.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And the color of that can
feel very shadow-like.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So with academia, we take a look
at how clairvoyant individuals

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
can actually sense much
more than they realize.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But we have to work
with our brains.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to work with our mind,
to teach our mind to say,

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
not everything that I see is
going to be harmful or scary.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to make
sense of what I can see.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
exorcisms fit in?

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: So exorcisms
is a belief system

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that what is going
on within my body,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm going through
some kind of trauma.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
within my body needs

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.490 align:middle line:90%
to be released from the body.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And I have a slight
agreement with that.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.727 align:middle line:84%
My problem with the
idea of exorcism

00:16:28.727 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're
looking at someone

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
who has some kind
of manic episode

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
or psychosis or schizophrenia
or personality disorder,

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:84%
it, on a frequency level,
looks like something.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And when that person
is experiencing that,

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
if the people around
them don't know

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
how to talk with that
person through psychosis,

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
deem it demonic,

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:90%
meaning some kind of possession.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So then we call it an
exorcist to remediate that

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:84%
without realizing that that
person is in need of assistance

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:90%
in some other way.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually where
we really push into dogma.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.069 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Pope had an
exorcist called Father Gabriele

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:90%
Amorth, who has died.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But he has done
thousands of exorcisms.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:84%
They did a movie about him,
starring Russell Crowe.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
I called Russell
weeks ago because I

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:84%
was talking about Father Amorth
on my program and said, Russell,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I want you to pop
on just for a minute

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:84%
to talk about what it was like
for you to play that part.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Did anything supernatural
happened to you?

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.128 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm in Budapest.

00:17:36.128 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:90%
It's 3:00 in the morning.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:90%
I got to go to bed.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Click.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, in that,
we have our experiences,

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and that we notate
our experiences.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And then those
experiences become

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:84%
a little bit
hyperbolized in our mind

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:90%
when we're talking about it.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And we do a really
good job in Hollywood

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:84%
to really make things feel
larger than they actually are.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to exorcisms,
what we're really trying to do

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:84%
is someone's coming in to
help move energy out of you.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And that individual,
me as a person,

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:84%
might have a strong
belief system in that.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And if my belief
system connects to what

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe they can do for me,
then my body will release.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But really, there is trauma
going on inside of that body.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that evil energy?

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, evil
is very subjective.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we teach
that is energy is just energy.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Energy does pool and
move towards the way

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that I believe, the
way that I behave,

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:84%
because our goal is to be
as neutral as possible.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So that way, we can just
look at frequency and energy

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:90%
for what it is.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So that way, I don't judge
it to be some kind of demon

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:84%
or judge it to be
some kind of angel.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:90%
It is just energy in motion.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have seen
clips, video clips

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
of strange anomalies,
what people would call

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:90%
ghosts or spirits whisking by.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: When you
look at how frequency

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
moves within the electromagnetic
field or within the biofield,

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:90%
it can leave a residual.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And our electronics are
great at picking up on that

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
because they work
with electric energy.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it will
just leave an impression.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And that impression may
not be the actual spirit.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.410 align:middle line:84%
It might be an echo of that
conscious energy or a residual.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:90%
But here's the kicker, George.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Not only can you sense
that from your electronics

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.470 align:middle line:84%
that might pick up on some
kind of echo of spirit energy,

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
but we, as the living,
leave those kinds

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:90%
of energetics in a space.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons
why people walk into a room

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:90%
and say, hmm, I don't know.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it doesn't feel so
good in this space right now,

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:84%
or it feels great in
this space because we

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
leave energy in the space.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
picked up on by a camera.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.402 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kimo, what
does it mean when

00:19:37.402 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
a clairvoyant has dreams of
destruction and death and evil?

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well,
it's very scary when

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.990 align:middle line:90%
a clairvoyant might see that.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it just
feels like a nightmare.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.312 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it feels like
a really bad dream.

00:19:51.312 --> 00:19:52.930 align:middle line:84%
But there are
certain clairvoyants

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:84%
who are more predominant
when they sleep.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We can call them
wondernauts or oneironauts.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:84%
In Hawaiian, we
call that Moe'uhane,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
which translates
into my soul sleeps,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:90%
but it sees at the same time.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And some clairvoyants, when
they see in the dream world,

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
usually, it is a sign of
fear in my everyday life.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to see
everything when I'm awake.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So when I go to
sleep, my mind says,

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:90%
great, he's finally asleep.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.430 align:middle line:10%
Now, we're going
to allow him to see

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:10%
in foresight, to see in
precognition in terms

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.875 align:middle line:10%
of what might be coming up.

00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And our brain is still
trying to make sense of that

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:90%
in our subconscious mind.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:90%
So it might deem it as scary.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a burnout for
a clairvoyant dream like that?

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: It can be.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But I utilize that
language of burnout

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:90%
for all of our abilities.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think about
it like a stereo.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:84%
If I were to turn up my
grand master and my treble

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and my bass all at
the same time, George,

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.230 align:middle line:90%
everything would distort.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So we strive to do
is to really train

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.330 align:middle line:84%
my clairvoyancy and
my clairaudience

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:90%
and my clairsentience.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
That way, I can
turn the levels down

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:84%
when I need to so they
don't go through burnout.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:84%
They don't go
through distortion.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about precognition,

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.050 align:middle line:90%
how that ties into this.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So in our precognition,
there's lots of individuals who

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:90%
are doing it without realizing.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:10%
It may be in the dream world
or in the astral world.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of individuals
would be remote viewers,

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:84%
but the precognition is
to see slightly ahead.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.778 align:middle line:90%
But I like to normalize this.

00:21:17.778 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:90%
So we think about it like this.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
If I were a clothing designer,
I see it in my mind's eye.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:90%
I make it happen.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm cooking a pie.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I see the pie in my mind's
eye, and I make it happen.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Or a football coach--

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I see the play.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:90%
I make it happen.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to precognition
and clairvoyancy,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:90%
again, all of us have access.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:90%
All of us do.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is retrocognition?

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Now, this is
where it gets really fun.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
When we look at things
retrocognitively,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:84%
instead of going into our slight
future, we go into our past

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of therapists are
quite good with this.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.937 align:middle line:84%
You're talking
about an event that

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.640 align:middle line:90%
happened to you in childhood.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you can truly go back
and visualize what was needed

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and what was happening
in that moment,

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
you in the present
state, me right now,

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I will feel a shift because
I retrocognitively went back

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:84%
in time to take a look
at dealing with whatever

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:90%
that demon or that trauma was.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And I feel the difference now.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we need
to remember events

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:84%
that happened in
our lives in order

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:90%
to have any clairvoyancy to it?

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, not
necessarily, George.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that for a
lot of individuals,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:84%
going back into memory
recall is quite easy.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.900 align:middle line:10%
For some individuals, memory
recall is not easy for them.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So we really strive to say, but
what can we do now with this?

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:84%
How can we give you
tools and exercises

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:90%
to fertilize that right now?

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:10%
It is helpful to be able
to have memory recall,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:10%
but there are some people who
don't tune into that easily.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.860 align:middle line:10%
But memory recall
will help us identify

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:10%
where, what kind of trauma is
going on inside of the body that

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.730 align:middle line:10%
might be affecting my body.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So for example, George,
if I'm looking at a client

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing different things
happening in the body, sometimes

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:84%
the color of what's going on
in your shoulder, for example,

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:84%
will give me an imprint
of what happened,

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.958 align:middle line:90%
what were the circumstances.

00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about
it, that client might say,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
wow, I haven't thought about
that since I was 15 years old.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you
retrocognitively go back

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and work on that, if they
can have some kind of,

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:84%
oh, I see what was
needed, what I actually

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:84%
was trying to maybe work
through in that moment,

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:84%
if I feel the
difference now, what

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.520 align:middle line:84%
that tells us is that
retrocognitively, it worked.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.415 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
work through trauma.

00:23:23.415 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And then that
client usually will

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
feel a little bit of a new sense
of motion in that shoulder.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
imminent probability mean?

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Imminent
probabilities is the language

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:90%
that I give timelines.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, I would
see all these futures,

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.420 align:middle line:90%
all these timelines.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
But what I learned
as I was growing up

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.668 align:middle line:84%
is that every timeline is
just an imminent probability.

00:23:43.668 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And actually, George,
on a frequency level,

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:84%
timelines look like
densities, so a large density

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
of this happening and then a
small density of something else

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.120 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I pay very close
attention to how large

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:84%
the density of that
probability is,

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:84%
which means that we're
putting in a lot of thought

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:90%
into this timeline right now.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't
want it to manifest,

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:03.723 align:middle line:90%
we've got to change the density.

00:24:03.723 --> 00:24:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We've got to change
the thought process.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
If we see a small density
of a probability coming in

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and we want more of it, we've
got to put more thought into it.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes more of an
existence of some kind of future

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that you want to have, some
kind of outcome that you want.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kimo, I've always been
a believer of what goes around

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:90%
comes around, karma.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, we translate
karma as an action plan.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:84%
For me, karma is a
visual experience

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.250 align:middle line:84%
in connection to
lessons that you're

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:90%
going through in this life.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And it can also connect to maybe
contracts, your soul contract.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
But if we take a look at
karma, what goes around

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:84%
comes around or the golden rule,
if I'm doing something nefarious

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.500 align:middle line:84%
in this life, will it
happen to me again?

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, we take a
look at what you're

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.190 align:middle line:90%
doing in this life as a lesson.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:84%
The lesson has a beginning,
and it has an end.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.455 align:middle line:84%
And if we can learn
to identify, well,

00:24:54.455 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:84%
what is the end of
this current lesson?

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
It does not actually affect the
rest of our karmic contracts

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of needing to come
back and repeat the lesson.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to repeat
the 12th grade?

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.140 align:middle line:84%
No one wants to
repeat any lessons,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:84%
so we strive to identify, how
can I look at these lessons now?

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In clairvoyancy, can
we change the future or not?

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, yes,
always, always, always.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an
example, George.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%
There'll be so many times
when I'm looking at a client

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.370 align:middle line:84%
where they say, the doctor has
given me three more months,

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:90%
three more months.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And that might look like
a visual density of this

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:84%
is predominantly
going to happen.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.170 align:middle line:84%
But if that person
says, but I don't

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.510 align:middle line:84%
want to leave this
world in three months,

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to stay, I'm not done
yet, what we do is we say, well,

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
let's work on changing what we
can see then, work on changing

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
how I can see
myself in foresight,

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.680 align:middle line:84%
sustaining a life
of good health,

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.290 align:middle line:84%
to be here for 10 more
years, 20 more years.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.160 align:middle line:84%
We have to put more weight
into a timeline that gives us

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.620 align:middle line:84%
the trajectory of being able
to be more foundational, more

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:90%
present, more here.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And the body will
receive the information.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And its cellular DNA, will
receive the information

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a little
doctor's story for you.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Doctor went up to
his patient and said,

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I've really got some
bad news for you.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what, Doc?

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've only
got three months.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.430 align:middle line:90%
He said, what do you mean?

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.070 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's all you've
got left, three months.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:22.960 align:middle line:10%
He said, Doc, I can't pay my
bill to you in three months.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:10%
He said, give you
another six months.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it like that?

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: It is like that,
George, which is desire.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:84%
All of our contracts are about
our acceptance of the contract.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we accept
that my contract is

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:84%
going to be eliminated
within three months

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
or if we accept that my
contract can be ameliorated

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.870 align:middle line:84%
to be changed, to be more
beautiful with an extension

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.650 align:middle line:90%
of 10 years, that is my choice.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And it is hard because
sometimes we're

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:84%
given these really
large prognosis.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have to make
very strong choices

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.210 align:middle line:84%
to change what I
can see in foresight

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.082 align:middle line:90%
of what that prognosis is.

00:26:59.082 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
psychics will try

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.140 align:middle line:84%
to make predictions of
the world, the future.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Is that the right thing to do?

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Is that ethical?

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: For me, it depends.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Even from Nostradamus's time,
if we take a look at things that

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:84%
are of assistance with our
collective, with our community,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.760 align:middle line:84%
with the world, I
would say, well,

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:90%
this is actually a good thing.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:21.778 align:middle line:84%
If something can
be of assistance,

00:27:21.778 --> 00:27:22.820 align:middle line:90%
it would be a good thing.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.710 align:middle line:90%
However, I am not an intuitive.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I am not a seer.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I am not a makaula
who says the biggest,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
baddest thing is going to happen
in two weeks and two years.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
I don't do that

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:90%
is that we have group resonance.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.280 align:middle line:10%
The larger the
amount of individuals

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.820 align:middle line:10%
who put time and effort
and thought into those

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:10%
probabilities
happening, we actually

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:10%
move ourselves closer to that.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And with my ability,
I don't want

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:84%
to use my ability
for those reasons.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So I actually stay away
from any kind of timeline

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that is about something
shifting in some kind

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:90%
of scary, dense way.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I work really, really hard to
not do that with my abilities.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you continue to
enhance your clairvoyancy?

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, I think that
there should be no end in sight.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I really strive to teach
other individuals--

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You get better?

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, you get better.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.340 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
thing as mastery.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I actually really
push against healers

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:84%
who call themselves a
master because there

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:84%
should be no summit of knowledge
when it comes to energy work.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I know that I can do some really
profound things with clients,

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.830 align:middle line:84%
but I still would not consider
myself ever to be a master.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't ever want to be one.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a student to the
work, to change what I know.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:84%
There is no ending
in sight to this.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:90%
It is just development.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.632 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can spirit
change its form?

00:28:40.632 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Spirit changes
its form all the time.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.965 align:middle line:84%
Spirit works
multidimensionally, just how

00:28:44.965 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:90%
we work multidimensionally.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:84%
But spirit works
multidimensionally.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And when it changes its form,
it's really helpful for us

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:50.880 align:middle line:90%
to know.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.330 align:middle line:84%
This is why-- it's like the
beginning of a psychic joke.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Two psychics walk into a bar.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.280 align:middle line:90%
One sees demon.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.720 align:middle line:84%
One sees the communication
of your grandmother.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Who's right?

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're both right,
because what ends up happening

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:84%
is every individual will
see things in the way

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
that their mind
already sees the world

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
so that spirit might
manifest as something scary,

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:84%
or it might manifest as
some kind of communication

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:90%
that is in beauty.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.080 align:middle line:90%
It just depends on the psychic.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: And a good joke.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you train
yourself to become better

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.165 align:middle line:90%
as a clairvoyant?

00:29:23.165 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Absolutely.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.220 align:middle line:84%
We can train ourselves, George,
to do any of our abilities

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:90%
more profoundly.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.520 align:middle line:84%
When I take a look
at a client, if I'm

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.520 align:middle line:84%
looking at all the different
senses and different ways

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that they are intuitive, it
looks like a graph to me.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:84%
It looks like, here's
what I do dormantly.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I do that's rising.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Here's what I do
that's in dominance.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have learned
that everything

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that is a dormant
frequency can be

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.613 align:middle line:90%
brought into a rising position.

00:29:46.613 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is
rising can be brought

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:90%
into a dominant position.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:84%
It just takes time and
process and consistency.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if the
clairvoyant is too emotional?

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Does that affect things?

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: It does.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
it gets tricky.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.380 align:middle line:84%
In essence, and in theory, when
we are working with clients,

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:84%
as a practitioner, we want to
remain as neutral as possible.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.100 align:middle line:84%
When I was a child, because I
am a very, very large empath,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.180 align:middle line:84%
as a child, it was
challenging for me

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to do spirit work
because I was so engaged

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:84%
with the emotions of the
client, which, in essence,

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I made it about me
without realizing it.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And we want to be as
neutral as possible

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.170 align:middle line:84%
to hold space for energy, to
hold space for that client.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So again, energy coming forward
is neither good nor bad.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:90%
It is just communication.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you go to bed
at night, are you wound up?

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.870 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: I have to work
really hard, George,

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.098 align:middle line:84%
to take my abilities and then
to turn them down consciously.

00:30:42.098 --> 00:30:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you do that?

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: You can.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
what I teach.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason
why we do this.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.820 align:middle line:84%
We want to train
our abilities to be

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:90%
able to disengage on command.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:10%
What you're seeing of me right
now is my avatar of the lights

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.580 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But when I go home, I
turn that bad boy down

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.720 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want to go to
bed seeing spirit and seeing

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.090 align:middle line:84%
frequency, which happened
to me my entire life.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I was a worse person to have
a sleepover with because I'm

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
always being talked to and
told certain kinds of things.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:13.085 align:middle line:84%
And your friend is sleeping in
the sleeping bag next to you,

00:31:13.085 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:84%
but his mom is going
through something.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Talk to my mom about something.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And I have to really learn
how to disengage from that.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:90%
So that's actually what I teach.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.118 align:middle line:84%
We should be able to say, here
is the avatar of who I am.

00:31:23.118 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I go home
and I rest, then I

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.760 align:middle line:84%
get to be this
new version of me.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.928 align:middle line:84%
It's like you as George
as what you're doing now.

00:31:28.928 --> 00:31:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that when you
go home, it probably

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.470 align:middle line:84%
feels good to take off the
suit and relax a little bit.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I know
on weekends, if I'm out,

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:84%
people come up to
me, and they want

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:84%
to know about UFOs
and ghosts and stuff.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:90%
KEPANO: That's on George time.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've done
that Monday through Friday.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.810 align:middle line:84%
You want to just
chill, but you also

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:84%
understand where
they're coming from.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.848 align:middle line:90%
So I give them the time of day.

00:31:52.848 --> 00:31:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the movie
"Ghost" with Whoopi Goldberg?

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.307 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: I love that movie.

00:31:56.307 --> 00:31:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She never
got any sleep--

00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: That's
what it feels like.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --because spirits
would jump into her

00:32:01.627 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and bother her all the time.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Does that happen to you
in a clairvoyant way?

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: It has.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't get my first
channel of spirit consciousness

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
actually until I was an adult.
And it came in because I

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.115 align:middle line:90%
was just not paying attention.

00:32:16.115 --> 00:32:17.192 align:middle line:90%
I was open.

00:32:17.192 --> 00:32:18.400 align:middle line:90%
I was vulnerable at the time.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And I talking to a friend,
and her mother had passed on.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I felt
like Whoopi Goldberg, not as

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.210 align:middle line:84%
fabulous, but I
felt my body shift.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at my body,
my body did not-- in my mind,

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.887 align:middle line:90%
it did not look like me.

00:32:31.887 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:90%
It looked like her mother.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.227 align:middle line:84%
I could see the color of
the nail polish, the ring

00:32:35.227 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that she had on, the smell of
the lotion that she was wearing.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
wrinkles in the hand.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Exactly.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So when I talk to my friend,
I said, something interesting

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.383 align:middle line:90%
is happening right now.

00:32:43.383 --> 00:32:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Your mother wore
this nail polish.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:84%
She had a ring that
looked like this.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.335 align:middle line:84%
This is the smell of the
lotion that she would use.

00:32:48.335 --> 00:32:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And my friend was like, that's
exactly what she would do.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But it felt like my body
was hers in that moment.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
spirit guides?

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.320 align:middle line:90%
How do they play a role?

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, I actually like to
differentiate the differences.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.112 align:middle line:84%
We have our guardians,
our spiritual team,

00:33:02.112 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
your grandfather, your
great grandmother.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:04.620 align:middle line:90%
We have them.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:90%
But then we have spirit guides.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.130 align:middle line:84%
When I look at spirit
guides, spirit guides

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.740 align:middle line:84%
would be someone who was
previously in body, no longer

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.590 align:middle line:84%
in body, who has done a lot
of developmental work, who

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:17.170 align:middle line:84%
has had new contracts and new
lives, a lot of relearning.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And then in that
communication, in

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that multidimensional
communication,

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.800 align:middle line:84%
is able to come and say, now let
me help guide you through this.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I have found that
spirit guides are not

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.830 align:middle line:90%
as loud as your spiritual team.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Your friend on the other side
and your mom on the other side,

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:90%
they're quite loud for me.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they reliable?

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, it depends
on the spirit guide.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I would say yes, George,
because in development

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.840 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, there is
a whole bunch of new learning

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.450 align:middle line:84%
that they have to do in order
to be of assistance to you.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.617 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
you're not getting tricked?

00:33:48.617 --> 00:33:50.825 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, well, and
again, that's why we really

00:33:50.825 --> 00:33:53.040 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure that we
remain neutral because it

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.020 align:middle line:84%
can feel like, well, couldn't
I be tricked by something else?

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, our mind
will absolutely be

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.380 align:middle line:84%
tricked if we haven't
substantiated a really strong

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.490 align:middle line:90%
sense of how we communicate.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And that takes exercise.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.842 align:middle line:84%
That takes development,
and it takes time.

00:34:06.842 --> 00:34:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And the awesome thing,
George, is that we

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.885 align:middle line:90%
have the time to do that.

00:34:09.885 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you sure do.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.468 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are some
of the best ways

00:34:12.468 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to get in touch with
your own spirits?

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: So it
depends on the person.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I have found that
clairvoyance for them,

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.969 align:middle line:90%
we channel into the mind's eye.

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But I might be a
clairaudient-dominant

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:23.949 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:26.679 align:middle line:84%
I will listen to a very
specific kind of music.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.770 align:middle line:84%
If you are a
touch-related individual,

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.739 align:middle line:84%
I will create exercises that
are about my physical way

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:32.580 align:middle line:90%
that I touch.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And we try to channel
spirit communication

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.590 align:middle line:84%
through what is
natural to your body

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.980 align:middle line:90%
or natural to your frequency.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got another
magical clip of you, Kimo,

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.260 align:middle line:84%
inviting people to become
advanced intuitives.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.060 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
- My goal is to teach you
how to do what I'm doing

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.770 align:middle line:90%
but to do it in your way.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.730 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
do it in Kimo's way

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:90%
because I am who I am.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:10%
But what I would love
to do is to teach you

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:10%
how to understand the things
that I have learned about either

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.150 align:middle line:10%
through my own spiritual
teachings and practices

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.490 align:middle line:10%
but also the things that
I have spent the time

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.770 align:middle line:10%
to get to know,
all of my teachings

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:10.230 align:middle line:10%
that I've been able to
acquire from working

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:10%
with neuroscientists and
surgeons and doctors.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to help you understand
what I've learned along the path

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.240 align:middle line:84%
so that way, you can expand
your own educational process

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.040 align:middle line:90%
within that.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.478 align:middle line:90%
You might already be a medium.

00:35:21.478 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:90%
You might already be a psychic.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.187 align:middle line:84%
You might already
be an intuitive.

00:35:24.187 --> 00:35:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You might be a shaman
or a kumu or a kahuna

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.020 align:middle line:90%
or a curandera or a brujo.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.910 align:middle line:84%
You might already be
a medicine person.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you
to do is to challenge

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.990 align:middle line:84%
your paradigm of thinking
to say, how can I

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:41.100 align:middle line:84%
take this information that this
aboriginal high seer is sharing,

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:45.010 align:middle line:84%
all the scholarly information
that I've been able to learn,

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.010 align:middle line:84%
how can you take it
and then synthesize it

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.570 align:middle line:90%
within your own practice?

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to
organically change everything

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.847 align:middle line:90%
that you need to.

00:35:53.847 --> 00:35:55.680 align:middle line:84%
You can take the
information that I bring in

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and say, now how can I adopt
that into my own practice?

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that I might make a
few adjustments along the way.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:10%
Be a holistic alchemist.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.200 align:middle line:10%
See what works.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:10%
See what doesn't work.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.920 align:middle line:10%
See what you would
like to do differently.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:84%
See what you would
like to do more of.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Let it stimulate new learning.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Why am I asking you to do that?

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what I did.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And I took years and
years to do this.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So what you are
seeing is the product

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.710 align:middle line:84%
of the fruits of
my labor, and I'm

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:21.670 align:middle line:90%
trying to share that with you.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.910 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:22.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very poignant.

00:36:22.868 --> 00:36:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Tell me the significance
of the beaded necklace.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, so right now,
I'm wearing pikake 'iliahi.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.460 align:middle line:90%
So I have this sandalwood.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Hawaiians call
'iliahi sandalwood.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Remind me to stay grounded.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.710 align:middle line:10%
And I'm wearing pikake
from the pikake,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.480 align:middle line:10%
which is the Chinese jasmine.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I wear it over my heart to
remind myself where I come from.

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you work with
your clients, what do they want?

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well,
most of my clients

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:84%
that come to work with me
are clients that are looking

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.890 align:middle line:90%
for development or for healing.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:51.893 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of clients.

00:36:51.893 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:84%
When I first opened
my practice, I said,

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.650 align:middle line:90%
I want to do spirit work.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And my response is, let's
do a little bit of that

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:84%
because you can go to spend time
with the medium to go do that.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.860 align:middle line:84%
We can do spirit work but only
if spirit is coming through

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.100 align:middle line:90%
to be of assistance.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.160 align:middle line:10%
And I have found that
when you communicate

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.490 align:middle line:10%
to your spiritual guides, your
spirit team, or maybe guides

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:11.800 align:middle line:10%
on the other side, if you
just ask for assistance,

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.482 align:middle line:10%
sometimes your spiritual
members or your spirit team

00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:16.940 align:middle line:10%
will show me, well, take a look
at this part of their body.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Ask them about this.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Their bone is doing this.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.290 align:middle line:84%
They haven't been diagnosed,
but the bone is doing this.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:22.415 align:middle line:90%
Ask them to go to a doctor.

00:37:22.415 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:90%
That happens all the time.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
ever a nuisance?

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: When I was young, yes.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.067 align:middle line:90%
I remember in high school even.

00:37:29.067 --> 00:37:31.150 align:middle line:84%
I would go to spend the
night at a friend's house.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And he lived in a house that had
elderly care on the first floor.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I would
go there, there had

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.455 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of
elderly individuals

00:37:39.455 --> 00:37:41.540 align:middle line:84%
because it was a hospice
house that had passed on.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And I had a hard time sleeping
over at my friend's house.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They died
in that house.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.102 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, yeah, because
that was a hospice house.

00:37:47.102 --> 00:37:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And there were so
many times where

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I would see things at the
foot of the bed and a person.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I could describe what
they looked like,

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:90%
what they were wearing.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And it was hard for me.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And now I was young at the time.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't yet learned
how to be able to say,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.900 align:middle line:84%
but I choose to see you
in a very specific way.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you are
coming through,

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.520 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a little afraid.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.173 align:middle line:10%
And you're showing
me a version of you

00:38:05.173 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:10%
that is going to scare
me because I still have

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.270 align:middle line:10%
to work through my own fear.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:09.653 align:middle line:90%
That was my lesson at that time.

00:38:09.653 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:15.265 align:middle line:84%
When you work with people,
what don't they want to know?

00:38:15.265 --> 00:38:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: That's
a good question.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I have found that there are
many clairvoyants, naturally

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:22.270 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyant individuals
who say, please

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.667 align:middle line:84%
do not tell me about the
scary thing that I saw.

00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Please do not tell me
that that thing that I

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.600 align:middle line:84%
saw when I was younger or the
thing that I saw in the mirror

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.540 align:middle line:90%
was real.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And my response to them is that
through the educational process,

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.260 align:middle line:84%
not only was it real, but it
was real for you in that moment.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can change what you
were experiencing in that moment

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.950 align:middle line:84%
because again, spirit,
just like all energy,

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.910 align:middle line:84%
is designed to be
a reflector for us.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.520 align:middle line:90%
What was I supposed to see?

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.530 align:middle line:84%
How can I learn from
that in that moment?

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the difference
between an intuitive

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.755 align:middle line:90%
and an advanced intuitive?

00:38:53.755 --> 00:38:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, because
we are all intuitive,

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:90%
we all have access to that.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I would call an
advanced intuitive

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the person who spent the time,
the development, and consistency

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and working with multiple
practitioners, not just one,

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.940 align:middle line:84%
not just one institution
of psychic abilities,

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.920 align:middle line:84%
not just one individual
that you found

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.980 align:middle line:90%
on Google, multiple people.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:10%
So that way, we
can really create

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:19.730 align:middle line:10%
a strong academic response to a
whole bunch of different ideas

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.955 align:middle line:10%
and then again, make
an organic assessment.

00:39:21.955 --> 00:39:23.330 align:middle line:10%
Take a little bit
of this thought

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.705 align:middle line:10%
and a little bit
of that thought.

00:39:24.705 --> 00:39:25.750 align:middle line:10%
What works for me?

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:27.542 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a
clip of you describing

00:39:27.542 --> 00:39:29.630 align:middle line:84%
how to work with spirit
guides in relationship

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:31.205 align:middle line:90%
to the clients and their needs.

00:39:31.205 --> 00:39:32.005 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

00:39:32.005 --> 00:39:32.570 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.028 align:middle line:84%
- We have been
learning how to work

00:39:34.028 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
with all of these
different guides,

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.450 align:middle line:84%
all of these different guides,
the guide of compassion,

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:42.500 align:middle line:84%
guide of physical health, guide
of understanding, guide of love.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But when it's time for you
to work with the guides,

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand,
but how am I

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:90%
going to work with that guide?

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And which is the guide that's
trying to communicate with me?

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I would utilize

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:84%
when I was first in
practice, when I was younger,

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I would silent my mind.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And I have all of my guides
that I know what they do.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.018 align:middle line:90%
I have a guide of love.

00:40:05.018 --> 00:40:06.060 align:middle line:90%
I have a guide of family.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I have a guide of architecture,
of all these different guides

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that do all these different
things for a very, very specific

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.120 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So when I would tune into
someone, I would silent my mind.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And I would watch
where my guides move

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.370 align:middle line:90%
in the room like a chess board.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would pay attention to
where in proximity that guide

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.640 align:middle line:90%
would be in relation to me.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if my guide
of love moved close to me,

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:36.440 align:middle line:84%
then I would know, when I open
my eyes and I turned on my Zoom

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and I went into
session with someone,

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.580 align:middle line:84%
what they were going to be
struggling with is information

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that was going to be in the
connection of love or heartbreak

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:90%
or wanting more foundation.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So I already had a precursor of
how to prep myself energetically

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.065 align:middle line:90%
to be in that space for them.

00:40:50.065 --> 00:40:50.870 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.483 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had a
reading that you didn't like?

00:40:54.483 --> 00:40:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, there
have been readings

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.350 align:middle line:90%
that have been scary for me.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But I view that all intelligence
is good intelligence, George,

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.050 align:middle line:84%
even the things
that are scary, even

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.910 align:middle line:84%
the things that I
get confused by.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And I strive to learn about
why that happens because again,

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you will have
spirit consciousness come in.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And that client
is talking about,

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.213 align:middle line:84%
yeah, my dad crossed over,
but he was a really nasty man.

00:41:15.213 --> 00:41:16.380 align:middle line:90%
He was really, really scary.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes spirit will
show themselves to me

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.465 align:middle line:84%
like that in the version
of how they saw them.

00:41:21.465 --> 00:41:22.590 align:middle line:90%
And what does that tell me?

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It tells me that the client
still has some trauma work

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to do based on that, but
that's not necessarily

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:90%
how I see them immediately.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, I see
them all in light.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I see them all in apology and
in love and in a strong sense

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.502 align:middle line:90%
of coherence.

00:41:36.502 --> 00:41:38.210 align:middle line:84%
But if the client sees
them in that form,

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:84%
then that tells me
how much work we

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:84%
have to do with the client
in their own trauma release.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you see death?

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: Well, death
is one of those things

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that I have refused
to do because I

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.120 align:middle line:84%
know that I can see
very, very clearly

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.692 align:middle line:90%
in foresight my entire life.

00:41:51.692 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, don't you
think you have an obligation

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:54.810 align:middle line:90%
to tell somebody something?

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: That's a
great question, George.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:10%
I have lots of people will say,
I know you don't do death dates,

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.690 align:middle line:10%
but we're trying
to figure this out.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel like it's
not my place to do that.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.677 align:middle line:84%
And when I see death
dates happen, they happen.

00:42:06.677 --> 00:42:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But I just don't think
that it's appropriate

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:12.020 align:middle line:84%
because if I put more weight
into the death date, once again,

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I am bringing more attention
to the resonance of that death

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.720 align:middle line:90%
date.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, everything
can be changed.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything can be changed.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about a warning?

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.558 align:middle line:84%
What if you see an
impending car accident?

00:42:24.558 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: That is what I do do.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:26.540 align:middle line:90%
I do give warnings.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You will tell them.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.540 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Absolutely.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.150 align:middle line:90%
But the way that I--

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To be careful
with something.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: Yeah, exactly.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.458 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of on a day
where there was extra rain

00:42:34.458 --> 00:42:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and you're driving this,
and you're running late,

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.708 align:middle line:84%
already to go to this certain
kind of an appointment,

00:42:38.708 --> 00:42:41.323 align:middle line:84%
that shows up in an imminent
probability in a timeline.

00:42:41.323 --> 00:42:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you
to do, when you

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.390 align:middle line:84%
know that you have to go to this
appointment and all of a sudden,

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.557 align:middle line:84%
it's raining, and you go
back into memory recall of,

00:42:46.557 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:84%
oh, Kimo said that there is
a timeline of this happening.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.042 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to slow down.

00:42:51.042 --> 00:42:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give myself
the time and the space

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.240 align:middle line:90%
to get there on time.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to drive
in the slow lane.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:57.455 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take my
time to get there.

00:42:57.455 --> 00:42:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So that way, we move
away from things

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.100 align:middle line:84%
that can be very, very
harmful or hurtful to us.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does this
gift evolve for you?

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: For me, even though I
know that I can do these really

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:09.830 align:middle line:90%
wonderful things--

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and right, now, at
this place in my life,

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to use it for
healing modalities.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I prefer to work with doctors.

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to work
with scientists,

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.558 align:middle line:84%
and I prefer to work
with neuroscientists

00:43:18.558 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to really help substantiate the
things I know that I can do.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.110 align:middle line:10%
And right now, in my
life, I'm striving

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.660 align:middle line:10%
to have that be one of
the predominant things

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.400 align:middle line:10%
that I'm working
for, because I really

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.090 align:middle line:10%
want the holistic community
to know that we can create

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:35.330 align:middle line:10%
a nexus of academia
and intelligence

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.720 align:middle line:10%
with our natural,
innate abilities.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.700 align:middle line:10%
There are so many psychics and
intuitives and readers out there

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.520 align:middle line:10%
who focus predominantly on
the psychic aspect but not

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.773 align:middle line:10%
the academic aspect.

00:43:44.773 --> 00:43:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And there can be
harmony and there

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.180 align:middle line:84%
should be harmony
between those two worlds.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
people find you, Kimo?

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.280 align:middle line:10%
>>KEPANO: You can just
type in thelightseer.com,

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.660 align:middle line:10%
and you'll find me.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.280 align:middle line:10%
You'll find my
sessions that I do.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:10%
You can find my seminars.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.073 align:middle line:10%
I do seminars
every single month.

00:43:59.073 --> 00:44:00.740 align:middle line:10%
I have a whole bunch
of different venues

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.573 align:middle line:10%
that you can utilize
to communicate with me.

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I have learning
modules that I release.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's no end to
how you can come have

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.280 align:middle line:90%
a play date with me, George.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.697 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
what's your website?

00:44:08.697 --> 00:44:10.715 align:middle line:84%
>>KEPANO: My website
is thelightseer.com.

00:44:10.715 --> 00:44:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kimo, thanks for

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.510 align:middle line:84%

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:16.947 align:middle line:84%

Hawaiian is perfect.

00:44:16.947 --> 00:44:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KEPANO: [LAUGHS] Mahalo.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is amazing
the clairvoyancy work

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that he does, teaching
other people how

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to foretell the future,
how to foretell the past.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
