00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.622 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.664 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.656 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:27.780 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
back to another edition

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we're
talking about cyber warfare.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Now you may not know it, but
your computer is vulnerable.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But so is the computers
that Uncle Sam owns.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Charles R. Smith with us,
expert on cyber security.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.624 align:middle line:90%
This is rampant, isn't it?

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:10%
>>CHARLES SMITH: It is
global and worldwide,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:10%
and it has a lot of
players, some of whom

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:10%
aren't even associated
with governments.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:10%
One of the interesting points
that has been made to me

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:10%
more than once is that if
your computer is connected,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.360 align:middle line:10%
it's vulnerable.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.845 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to
do is be targeted.

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And even if you've got some
of the most secure equipment

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.320 align:middle line:84%
in the world, someone
could probably

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:90%
still penetrate and get in.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
The CIA and the
NSA both use what

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:84%
they refer to as
secure systems that

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:84%
sit in rooms that are not
connected to anything.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.940 align:middle line:84%
The most secure
information of all

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
is actually encrypted on
those and then carried by hand

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.025 align:middle line:84%
to other systems, where
it's transmitted--

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:35.427 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the only way
to avoid it I guess, huh?

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.955 align:middle line:84%
If that line is coming
in, it can go both ways.

00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was talking to my
bank a few weeks ago, Charles,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
as I go online all the time
and I just check my deposits

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:90%
and what's coming out.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed a check had come
in, and I didn't write it.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a lot of
money, it was like $200,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
but it was to a company I
had no idea what it was.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I called my bank and they
said, you didn't do this?

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:90%
And I went, no I didn't do it.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:90%
So they put a stop on it.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:90%
I didn't lose any money.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere along the line,
somebody had my routing number

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and had my account number,
and created this ACH,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:90%
and they hit it.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Well I called the company that
the bank had a phone number

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
for, which is interesting--
the onus is on you.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:84%
The bank doesn't even
make the calls for you.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:90%
They don't care.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So I got this phone number
and I called these people,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and they said somebody had made
an order to buy some Bitcoins.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh really?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't me.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they stopped
the transaction.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
They then called me back
three days later and said,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
we've uncovered a much
broader fraud network

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
of which you were
the first person

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:90%
to tell this to us about.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:90%
We've shut down that account.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, I didn't lose
any money, but it's also

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
disconcerting because
somebody had my routing number

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:90%
and my check number.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.856 align:middle line:90%
And God knows how they got it.

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's a number
of ways of how they got it.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And obviously you,
the lucky consumer,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:84%
didn't too inconvenienced
or hurt by it.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere out there I'm sure
there's several merchants who

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
probably got burned if they
lost merchandise because someone

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:90%
made a phony order.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They shipped.

00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And now they have
to write it off as a loss.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the end,
you as a consumer

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
have to pay higher prices in
order to make up for that loss.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:84%
The same thing if the
bank had to absorb a cost,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
you as a consumer quietly
and in the background

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:84%
have to pay a higher cost to
make up for that for the bank.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And as the stockholders in
any of the corporations that

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.470 align:middle line:84%
are involved, they
would lose a little bit.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.275 align:middle line:90%
So they pay.

00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:06.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: How they got
the routing number,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
there is a number of
different electronic as well

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:84%
as non-electronic
methods to do that.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
They may not even have gotten
a router number literally

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
out of your mailbox,
they may have

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
been able to do
it electronically

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.670 align:middle line:84%
from a previous
transaction, from someone

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
who walked into a garbage
bin behind the bank

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and found a bunch of
stuff, or as we've

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.610 align:middle line:84%
seen with some post offices,
large amounts of mail

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:90%
have suddenly disappeared--

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
if you order something

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
online that you're ordering
from a legitimate company?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you do enter sometimes
your bank account information.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
What if you don't
ever get the product

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:90%
but they have your information?

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Do they catch you that way?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They can.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, if they're
not secure, they can be hacked.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And they may be an innocent
bystander or a third-party

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
as someone else walks
into their accounts

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and then into your
account and steals that.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
It's rather interesting,
one of the major banks

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
has introduced what they refer
to as I think it's check card.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, they give you a
temporary credit card number

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
where you can put
a very small limit.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And you do-- this is for online
transactions-- you actually

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
go make the online transaction,
we'll say, with a $50 limit.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's got a two-month
expiration date--

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's gone.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And-- exactly.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And then obviously if
someone else gets that card,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.808 align:middle line:84%
they have virtually no
money to draw against.

00:05:46.808 --> 00:05:47.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:47.433 --> 00:05:48.974 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
hurt you that much.

00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that
probably should

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
have been done about
10 to 15 years ago,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
but most of the
banks didn't really

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:84%
have an incentive to institute
this until consumers started

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:84%
screaming loud
enough that we need

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to have some method of at
least limiting the losses.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this is that
it can also, as you pointed out,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:90%
uncover a bigger hack.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:90%
For example, Bitcoin.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Transferring the
money into Bitcoin

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:84%
means they could transfer
the money literally anywhere

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:84%
You, losing $200, may never
noticed and reported it.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Well if they hit, say, 100,000
people all for about $200--

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Adds up.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Now we've
got millions, which

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
could be transferred into
Bitcoin, to an offshore bank,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
to bounce through electronically
through several other banks

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and then disappear into
the Never Never Land.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Even security, for
example on Bitcoin,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that actually uncovered
a major hack which

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:90%
lead back to the US government.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily as
the hacker, but as

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
the one that insisted
that the door exists.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Essentially,
Bitcoin was allowing

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
their international
monetary figures

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
to be secured with a system
embedded in your cellphone

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.246 align:middle line:90%
or in other Android products.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
The encryption
itself actually had

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:90%
a flaw in generating the key.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Generating the key is actually
the most difficult portion.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
You need an absolute random
number at best you can.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And most systems use what
they call pseudo-random number

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
generators, meaning
they use a formula.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:90%
Well this formula had a flaw.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Hackers found that flaw and
were able to break into Bitcoin

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and literally create
millions of dollars

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
of fake money,
which they exploited

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:90%
until this door was closed.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
However, that door, that back
door into creating the key,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:84%
may have been instituted by
the National Security Agency

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:84%
with major players such as
Google, Microsoft, Apple

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and others, who manufacture
the software behind many

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:90%
of these machines.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
The pseudo-random
number generators

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
were developed and distributed
by these major corporations.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
The quote was,
well, it was a flaw

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't anticipate in the
mathematics, and we apologize.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that several
mathematicians have recently

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.654 align:middle line:84%
found flaws in several
forms of pseudo--

00:08:40.654 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're everywhere.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --random
number generators,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
including those recommended by
the National Security Agency.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, even used
by major government entities.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
The NSA would like to have that
back door, because they enjoy

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
monitoring this for their
own purposes, some of which

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
are legitimate, some of
which are not legitimate.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of which are
legal, some of which

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:90%
are outside of our Constitution.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And if they find a manufacturer
that doesn't cooperate,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
because these companies are
told you must put this in there

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:84%
or we'll shut you down or
we'll take you to court.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can't tell
anyone because there's

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
a secrecy notice under
this, and if we take you

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:90%
to court, even that's secret.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It happens behind closed doors.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.125 align:middle line:90%
It's almost Orwellian in nature.

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: A company by
the name of Lavabit

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
developed a very secure
communications network.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
The NSA approached them
and said we want in.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
We insist that you put
in a back door for us

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:90%
to monitor all communications.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Lavabit prior to that
had cooperated with them

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
on individuals where they had
warrants, but in this case

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:84%
it was a global we want
access to everything.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The owner of Lavabit said
well the heck with you,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:90%
and shut down the business.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Completely closed.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Were they profitable?

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, they
were very profitable.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Well the fun part
about this is when

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:84%
he said I'm closing
the business,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:84%
the NSA representative said we
will prosecute you if you do.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.056 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wanted
him to stay open.

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The point
being is at what point

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.025 align:middle line:84%
does it become your
business or their business.

00:10:28.025 --> 00:10:29.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:10:29.165 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And we've seen
this with major corporations

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
such as the ones I mentioned
where they are literally

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:90%
bound by federal law.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
If they shut
themselves down, they

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:90%
may individually be prosecuted.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Or if they expose this,
they may be prosecuted.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
The Snowden documents
have uncovered

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:90%
a lot of this operation.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And again, I can
attest personally

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
to the kind of intimidation
that the NSA likes to put out.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I think they're going
about it the wrong way,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and I've voiced
that to them before.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
It's unfortunate many of
the ground-level folks,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
the actual combat troops that
work there, agree with me,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.307 align:middle line:84%
whereas the political
appointees disagree.

00:11:10.307 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
How dangerous is the ability
to tap into our power grid

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and shut it down, missile
silos and launch a missile,

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:90%
are these things all possible?

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're quite
possible, and we've already seen

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:90%
some of these things happen.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
A real good example
is the Stuxnet virus,

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
which infected the Iranian
nuclear processing devices.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Essentially these large
uranium processors

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:90%
were computer-controlled.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:84%
The Stuxnet virus
that infected them

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:84%
turned these machines into
essentially a large meltdown.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.122 align:middle line:84%
They literally
self-destructed right

00:11:57.122 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:90%
in front of the Iranian eyes.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.650 align:middle line:90%
It put them years back.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Without ever having
dropped a bomb,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:84%
they were suddenly
put out of operation.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our network
is controlled

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:90%
by devices called SCADA.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
The SCADA device is less
secure than your credit card.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:90%
I am not kidding.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And these things actually
control our power grid, water,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
sewer networks, in some cases
many of the communications

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:90%
networks.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
The SCADA devices can be
hooked up not only directly

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
to wired communications,
but they can also

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:90%
be hooked up through wireless.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
A good example is a large
number of the petrochemical

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:84%
manufacturers have them hooked
up to wireless communications.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why do they use
this thing if it's that weak?

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It is essentially
the only device available that

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:90%
has been put out on the market.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
been toughened up,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.353 align:middle line:90%
but they're much more expensive.

00:12:55.353 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does it do?

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Think of
it as a controller.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:84%
You can turn on and
off your lights.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:84%
You can turn on and
off a valve that

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:84%
controls the production of,
say, plastics or petroleum.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:90%
You can route electricity.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:84%
You can change the
air conditioning

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.267 align:middle line:90%
in a major retail outfit--

00:13:15.267 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just with
a push of a button.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And you can monitor
them, because they also

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:84%
monitor things going on around
them with sensors attached

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And any really good
hacker can hack into them.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the power grid was
not only extremely vulnerable,

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:84%
in many cases-- and
still to this day--

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.840 align:middle line:84%
the power grid's
communication network

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.165 align:middle line:90%
is the power grid itself.

00:13:37.165 --> 00:13:40.940 align:middle line:84%
They actually communicate over
the electrical power lines

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.200 align:middle line:84%
directly to the SCADAs
that control routing

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:90%
and transformer operations.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is quite likely
that, at some point,

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
somebody could reach in there
and knock those things out.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing it
from a personal level

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
or a terrorist level,
yeah, you can do it

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
with a computer sitting
thousands of miles away.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're the NSA, you
can do the same thing.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, the
NSA has penetrated

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
into these networks that are
in use not only in the US,

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.325 align:middle line:90%
but outside the US.

00:14:10.325 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you're
sitting in the cockpit

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
of an F22 or an F18,
you have the capability

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:84%
of literally reaching out and
shutting down an entire power

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:90%
grid with the touch of a button.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just by flying over it?

00:14:22.985 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Not even
by flying over it,

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
just by flying within a
couple hundred miles of it.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The advanced electronic
scanned radar systems,

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
the brand-new radars that
are in the F18, the F22,

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and are being mounted on a
lot of the other aircraft,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:84%
such as the F35
Joint Strike Fighter,

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:84%
it's not like your
granddad's radar.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a super advanced radar.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It can not only be used
to target and radar track

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:84%
like the good old
days, but you can also

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:84%
use it to listen to
communications, hack

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:90%
into computers.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily even
have to be present, obviously,

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
you can do this from
hundreds of miles away.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can even hack into
computers that don't even have

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
wireless hookups simply because
there are exploits where you

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:84%
can broadcast and/or beam
high-energy systems directly

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:84%
into a computer and
essentially insert a virus,

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
read what's going on,
communicate with the computer,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:90%
tell it to do things--

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are vulnerable.

00:15:30.355 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Extraordinarily.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, this
has already been used.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:84%
The Israelis used a similar
system against the Syrians

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
when they destroyed the
nuclear weapons development

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:90%
facility a few years ago.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:84%
They literally shut down the
Syrian air defense network--

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.185 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: First.

00:15:46.185 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And flew in
totally unopposed.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They not only shut
down the network,

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
they made the people who
were controlling the network

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.500 align:middle line:84%
think that there
was nothing going on

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.280 align:middle line:84%
even after the first
bombs had fallen.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Brilliant.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I assume we have
the same technology.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We have the same,
if not better in some cases.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
The devices come under
a code name Suitor,

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:90%
and then there is Senior Suitor.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:84%
These devices are not
only separate electronics,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:84%
but they're also integrated
into the AESA radar systems.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
The AESA radar,
think of it in terms

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:84%
of-- in the good old days,
you could take a flashlight

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and beam it around
a room, a dark room,

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:90%
and see what's going on.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.960 align:middle line:10%
Well these days, the AESA
is kind of like a laser,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:10%
except you don't have one, you
have a whole array of them.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So you can fan this out, you
can make them jump frequencies,

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:84%
you can make it
very fine-tuned, you

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:84%
can use it as a communications
listener or transmitter.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you can break
into their codes,

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
a very good example is
like what the Israelis did.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.935 align:middle line:84%
They broke into the
Syrian code systems--

00:16:58.935 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shut it down.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.974 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: For the
communications--

00:17:00.974 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:90%
they didn't just shut it down.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:84%
What they did is they
intercepted the codes coming

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
from the radar chain saying
we detect incoming aircraft,

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and changed that to we don't
detect anything coming in,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:90%
everything is A-OK.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Brilliant.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they
did it in real time.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.892 align:middle line:84%
They can do this with both voice
as well as data communications.

00:17:19.892 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now does everybody
have this technology, Charles?

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.554 align:middle line:90%
The Russians, the Chinese?

00:17:23.554 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The Russians
and the Chinese, yes.

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:84%
However in their cases,
it's more in the lab

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:90%
than out in production.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:84%
The AESA radar that's being
produced by both the Russians

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and Chinese are actually
light years behind the ones

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:90%
that we currently have.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:84%
The AESA actually even has
a dangerous side to it.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The F22, for example,
was literally

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
able to hack into an
air-to-air missile fired

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and disable the
missile in flight.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
The worst part about this
is that you can actually

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.180 align:middle line:84%
take this beam, crank it up
and focus it literally down

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.760 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
you can destroy

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.470 align:middle line:84%
electronics, or
potentially even be used

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:90%
as an anti-personnel weapon.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Destroy an individual.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
aim it at him?

00:18:14.105 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: If you have
25,000 watts of radar power

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that you can concentrate
down to, say,

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:84%
a millimeter-sized point, you
can more or less burn a hole

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:90%
right through their forehead.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So as these things get
more and more powerful,

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see a lot
more of it be deployed.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:41.710 align:middle line:84%
The F35, for example, has design
set up so-- as you well know,

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:84%
the Marine version is
designed to land and take off

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.915 align:middle line:84%
with a fan located
just behind the pilot.

00:18:48.915 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they have
already proposed and designed

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
a version where they're
pulling the fan out and putting

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:00.510 align:middle line:84%
a giant generator in place
to tap the power directly

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:middle line:84%
from the engine and use
that both for the AESA radar

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
as well as an onboard
laser to replace guns.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.775 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine the
kind of energy weapon

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
that these things
are designed to be.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Now there are limits
to the effectiveness.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
An air-to-air
missile, for example,

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:84%
if I aim it at that missile,
I can either disable it

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
or in some cases even
destroy it with this.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It's very thin, it's
very lightweight,

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.590 align:middle line:90%
and the electronics are exposed.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
A nuclear reentry vehicle,
nuclear warhead reentry

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:84%
vehicle, is very
heavily-shielded

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
for both thermal
as well as coming

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:84%
in through the
atmosphere and radiation.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Using an AESA against it
may not do anything at all,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:84%
because it has
already been shielded

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:84%
against the kind of radiation
that the AESA can broadcast.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that there are a
variety of things that you can

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and cannot do.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it
an asteroid away?

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.095 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could not do that.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.386 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if
you catch a missile,

00:20:02.386 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:84%
say a ballistic missile in
the early stage of its flight,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
you may be able to disable
its control mechanism

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:84%
or, as I suspect has
already been done

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:84%
in the case of air-to-ground
or air-to-air missiles,

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle line:84%
actually turn the missile back
on the opponent that fired it.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Flip it around.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Literally.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Turn your own
weapons against you.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And as these things get
more and more sophisticated,

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
the AESA radar as well
synthetic aperture radar

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
can do things like detect
people walking on the ground

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and tell whether they are
carrying a gun or not.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about
doing this from 10 miles,

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.484 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about doing this
from 200, 300 miles away,

00:20:41.484 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:84%
or from space if they're
mounted that far out.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On one
hand, Charles, it

00:20:44.775 --> 00:20:46.700 align:middle line:84%
seems like having this
kind of technology

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.970 align:middle line:90%
is fantastic, brilliant.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad we have it.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other
hand, can it be abused?

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:84%
The supercomputers
and satellites

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:84%
sold by major contractors to
the National Security Agency,

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:84%
as it has well-published,
have been abused by employees

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
to do things like follow
their ex-girlfriend or break

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
into commercial outfits
that they did not like,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:84%
by individuals
employed or contractors

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:90%
employed by the NSA.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It has been used against
political opponents,

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:84%
as well as against
commercial opponents.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
This kind of
intelligence, as well as

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
the kind of intelligence
apparatus-- a real good example

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.610 align:middle line:84%
is, by law, the
NSA is not supposed

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:84%
to give this
information unless it's

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:90%
required to law enforcement.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
However, as the
documentation has proven,

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:84%
the NSA gave this
information to the FBI

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:84%
to attempt to track down
fraudulent credit card

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:90%
operations.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:84%
The NSA has given
this information

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
to the IRS, which used it to
track down political opponents

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
to attempt to essentially charge
them with illegal tax evasion.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm able to
sit at a chair,

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:84%
as Snowden has illuminated,
and say literally track

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:84%
anyone anywhere,
any time, literally

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing, where
they are, where they've been,

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
what kind of transactions,
how big is their bank account

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and what can I do about
it, it is rife for abuse.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And if we do not have an
audit trail to find out

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.290 align:middle line:84%
who's doing these
kinds of things,

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:84%
or that audit trail is so secret
that no one knows about it,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.630 align:middle line:84%
then the abuse will take place
and continue to take place

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:90%
until something happens.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Now the NSA does
have a point, yeah,

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
we can use this
against terrorists.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And as we've seen
against the lone wolf,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.150 align:middle line:90%
this stuff is useless.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't use the kind of
communications that are being

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:90%
tapped, they use couriers.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Al Qaeda did.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Osama bin
Laden didn't even

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.950 align:middle line:84%
have a computer in his
compound, for obvious reasons.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So the flip side to this is that
it does cost a lot of people

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:90%
a lot of lives.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And a very good
example I can point out

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:84%
is one of the laws that came on
the books like in California.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman working for the
state government was able

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to hack into the records of
the Division of Motor Vehicles,

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.830 align:middle line:84%
find his ex-wife, and then he
went and killed her even though

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.330 align:middle line:90%
she had--

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --a restraining order
and had changed her address

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:90%
numerous times.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Now that made an
audit trail be formed,

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
meaning that if you go to
your local DMV in most states,

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.680 align:middle line:84%
you can ask who's been
looking at my records.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:90%
But who knows about that?

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who knows
that, nobody knows that.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But if you
were curious, go ask.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.663 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do they
have to tell you?

00:23:48.663 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They should.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:90%
In some states, it's a law.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
this information

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:84%
has been used for
political purposes.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The illustration there
is operatives working

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:84%
for the Clinton
administration who

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
were supposed to vet people
going into the White House

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:10.010 align:middle line:84%
used the very same network
to get into the FBI network

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and check for criminal records
on political opponents,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and passed that information
to the Clinton administration

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.450 align:middle line:90%
officials.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There
are some companies

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
that you can go online and
register, pay a little fee,

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and just say who's
looking for me.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And they'll give you
a list of people.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.795 align:middle line:90%
How do they find that out?

00:24:31.795 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Through
these audit trails.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.960 align:middle line:84%
If you, for example, look
at your driving record,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:84%
you will see queries from, say,
your insurance company to make

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.830 align:middle line:90%
sure that you have insurance.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
If you got pulled over,
you'll see a query

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.610 align:middle line:84%
from the police officer at
that point who pulled you over.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.510 align:middle line:84%
If, for example, you
buy a new vehicle,

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:84%
you'll see a query
against your account,

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:84%
say, at the criminal
level to make sure

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't
a criminal trying

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.110 align:middle line:90%
to register a stolen vehicle.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things take
place behind the scenes.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
they can be dangerous

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.342 align:middle line:84%
because, if they are abused
by the wrong individual,

00:25:12.342 --> 00:25:13.800 align:middle line:84%
they can get
information about you.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I've actually worked
cases where I've

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:84%
advised clients go to
the agency involved,

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:90%
demand an audit trail.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And we have successfully
uncovered individuals

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
who were illegally tracking them
using data that was obtained

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:90%
from the government.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with this is there's

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:84%
so many different
databases, some of whom

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:90%
do not have an audit trail.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, if they
do have an audit trail,

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:90%
it's not available to you.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And I can illustrate the NSA.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's questioned at this
point whether the data

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that Mr. Snowden walked
away with actually

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.120 align:middle line:90%
had an audit trail.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So they're not quite sure
what did he walk out with.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Did he hack the NSA computers?

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:84%
He walked in with an
ordinary thumb drive,

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
downloaded the
information onto it,

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.312 align:middle line:84%
and then walked
right out with it.

00:26:08.312 --> 00:26:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And the ultimate
irony is, as we've

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:84%
discussed before, some
of the answers to this

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.750 align:middle line:90%
is going back to the stone age.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
The German intelligence
agencies have gone back

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:84%
to using typewriters
instead of computers

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.521 align:middle line:90%
to write secure information on.

00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:25.020 align:middle line:90%
The--

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.061 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
to be said about that.

00:26:27.061 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The FAA
has been accused

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:90%
of potentially being hacked.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I know for a fact
it's not likely.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
That's because the computers
and the networks used by the FAA

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.610 align:middle line:84%
are so old many of the
people who put them together

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.480 align:middle line:90%
are no longer alive.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Hackers these days don't
even have the capability

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.577 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's going
on inside those computers--

00:26:47.577 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because they're so old.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Because they're so old.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The Ukrainians used this
against the Russians.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:84%
The Russians
attempted to hack in

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and used electronic warfare
against their air defense

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.230 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:04.365 align:middle line:84%
The Ukrainians, instead of
using the modern integrated air

00:27:04.365 --> 00:27:06.277 align:middle line:84%
defense with
distributed networks--

00:27:06.277 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
think of it as kind of like
an internet for air defense.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.900 align:middle line:84%
You can put a missile
here and a radar there,

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and everybody
communicates together.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.581 align:middle line:84%
What they did is,
the heck with that.

00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:84%
We're severing all
those connections

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're putting little
individual batteries

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:90%
separately all over the place.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.414 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians were unable
to shut down their network--

00:27:23.414 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the old
World War II days.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Unable to shut down
their network because they

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:33.930 align:middle line:84%
ran into this little sponge
of non-integrated air defense

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.260 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, your
old analogue answer,

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that old analogue car in your
garage may be a lot more secure

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:45.540 align:middle line:84%
than your Prius because,
as they've already proven,

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
you might be able to get hacked
in a Prius and somebody could

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
take over the brakes,
the accelerator,

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.285 align:middle line:90%
maybe even your steering wheel.

00:27:53.285 --> 00:27:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
biggest dangerous thing

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.820 align:middle line:90%
that could happen?

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Data mining.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, these gigantic
networks of supercomputers

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:84%
are integrating together with
all of the data-- literally all

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:84%
of your phone calls, all
of your transactions--

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and they are providing
this information basically

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to paying requesters,
both commercial as well

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:90%
as governmental and military.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, data mining
does have a problem with it

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.570 align:middle line:84%
in that, if you don't
program it correctly,

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:84%
you can come up with
the wrong conclusions.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And it is possible
in the near future

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:84%
that we may in
essence start a war

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.900 align:middle line:84%
or get involved in
a war that was never

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:84%
going to happen simply
because the computers told us

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:84%
that's going to happen
tomorrow and we can predict it

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.840 align:middle line:84%
beyond an infinite number,
because we've calculated it out

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.300 align:middle line:90%
based on the data.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.655 align:middle line:84%
We've become far too trusting
of these major organizations

00:28:54.655 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and the supercomputers that
are, in some cases, behind them.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will they turn on us?

00:29:01.315 --> 00:29:03.800 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: I don't believe
in artificial intelligence

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:10%
simply because you
can't program a computer

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:10%
to understand the word maybe.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Any teenager knows
the word maybe.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Just have one or talk to one.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:84%
A computer is a black and
white, yes or no thing.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And as long as humans
continue to maintain

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.570 align:middle line:84%
their hand on the on/off
switch, we stand a chance.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:29.190 align:middle line:84%
The problem-- one of the
things I did research into

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.300 align:middle line:84%
was neural networks,
which were really big.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
The army wanted to
create a missile that

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.515 align:middle line:84%
could hunt down-- find,
identify an enemy tank,

00:29:37.515 --> 00:29:39.670 align:middle line:90%
and hunt it down and kill it.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So they trained a neural network
to recognize enemy Russian-made

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.360 align:middle line:90%
tanks.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And they showed it millions
of pictures of different tanks

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.050 align:middle line:90%
from different angles.

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to get
it down in the laboratory

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.640 align:middle line:84%
to literally where
it was like 99.99%

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.910 align:middle line:90%
of the time deadly accurate.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:84%
They took it out in the
field, and it failed.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered
the reason why.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
They'd shown it pictures
of tanks on cloudy days.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:13.219 align:middle line:84%
So when they showed it a picture
of a tank on a sunny day,

00:30:13.219 --> 00:30:14.260 align:middle line:90%
it couldn't recognize it.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It didn't
know what it was.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It had no
idea what it was.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So the data that we give
to these so-called learning

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:84%
machines is essentially
what drives them.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And it can have
unpredictable results.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So literally the
US Army threw away

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:84%
nearly a billion
dollars trying to create

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:90%
an intelligent missile.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:37.950 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might be able to
get down to that these days.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But as we've seen with
unmanned aerial vehicles,

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.580 align:middle line:84%
which are making
a big comeback--

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.002 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Splash, yep.

00:30:49.002 --> 00:30:53.375 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The objective is if you
put them in a computer network

00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and computer-controlled,
you still

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.880 align:middle line:84%
have an operator
or someone there

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.660 align:middle line:84%
who is taking control of
them and watching them

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and what they're doing and
what they're receiving.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, for
example with the NSA,

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.091 align:middle line:84%
when they do intercepts,
there's no way

00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:90%
to have a person in that loop.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.070 align:middle line:90%
There's just too much data.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So they have to have
filter programs.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
The Taliban tried
to avoid that filter

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:84%
by sending text messages to
each other with spam headings.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, buy Viagra
or get a loan.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, that really didn't
work because they weren't

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
just looking at
the headers, they

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
were also checking out
most everything else.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:84%
The problem is you can
trigger these mechanisms.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And I have frequently poked
fun at intelligence agencies

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:46.110 align:middle line:84%
by using telephones or
text messages or emails,

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.127 align:middle line:84%
where I will intersperse
them with U235 or VX or VR--

00:31:49.127 --> 00:31:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just to play with them.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Nerve gas.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.465 align:middle line:84%
Just so I know that
I'm triggering their--

00:31:54.465 --> 00:31:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it does.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And it does.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.278 align:middle line:84%
And it eventually gets worked
up to a human being who

00:31:58.278 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:84%
goes oh, that's Charlie Smith,
and throws it out the window.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.864 align:middle line:84%
Well the problem
with that is-- we've

00:32:03.864 --> 00:32:05.780 align:middle line:84%
talked about this with
intelligence officials.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Again, the human is the
flaw in every operation.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Computers and machines do
what they're told to do.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Humans don't
necessarily do that.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Biologics.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the things a union
member who was-- their company

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.740 align:middle line:84%
was using these tracking
cards to track them

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.755 align:middle line:84%
whenever they were
on premises where

00:32:26.755 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:84%
they were going to the
bathroom, how long were they

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.421 align:middle line:90%
on the break.

00:32:29.421 --> 00:32:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And a union member
approached me and said look,

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.960 align:middle line:90%
we don't like this.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.380 align:middle line:84%
We want to find a way
to get rid of this.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.110 align:middle line:10%
So I said, simple.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:10%
Get one of the badges
from one of the officers.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure that you have a way.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:10%
And get a rat.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.110 align:middle line:10%
Put the badge on the rat
and release him on premises.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I understand that the security
folks spent the next three

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.445 align:middle line:84%
weeks trying to chase this
rat down as the computers--

00:32:55.445 --> 00:32:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they had no
idea that it was on a rat.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They had no
idea it was a rat.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's funny.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they knew
it was a stolen badge,

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and it was all over the place.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Charles, the
technology is amazing.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:10%
Look, you have
only heard the tip

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:13.450 align:middle line:10%
of the iceberg of what could
happen with cyber technology.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:10%
What will the future hold?

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.960 align:middle line:10%
It's anybody's guess.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.820 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:35.104 align:middle line:90%
