>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.250 align:middle line:10%
Jeremy Ray is with us.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:10%
We've got an amazing
program for you.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.430 align:middle line:10%
Chief investigator
of MUFON Colorado,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:10%
has spent 20 years researching
and investigating UFOs.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.122 align:middle line:90%
That's a great job.

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JEREMY RAY: Thank you, sir.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I didn't believe in UFOs
when I was growing up as a kid.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw one
in my neighborhood.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.418 align:middle line:84%
And that one day
changed my whole life.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were hooked.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:10%
>>RAY: Oh, yeah, it was
a reality transformation

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:10%
type of event for me, absolutely
made me question everything.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jeremy, the Mutual
UFO Network, of course,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.230 align:middle line:10%
stands for this acronym of
UFOs all over the country.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:10%
You've got branches everywhere.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:10%
And you folks do a great job,
so thank you for what you do.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Thank you, sir, yep.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
is your primary role

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:90%
with Colorado MUFON?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, right now, my
title is chief investigator.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:84%
What happens is most of the
UFOs that come to Colorado,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.430 align:middle line:90%
they come to my desk.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And then what I do is
I try to figure out

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.765 align:middle line:90%
where I'm going to send it to.

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I basically assign it
to other investigators.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I also train, and we
host monthly meetings

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:84%
at a convention
center in Denver.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And I also recruit for
more investigators.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What type of reports
have been coming to your desk?

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I would
say we usually get

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:90%
a UFO report every other day.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
pretty predominant.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And most of them are over
Cheyenne Mountain, Pikes Peak,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.440 align:middle line:90%
and Peterson Space Force Base.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
the reports like?

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, we usually
get two of those a month.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that those are
like a hot spot for Colorado

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:84%
That's been going on for
about six to seven months.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:84%
The type of reports
that we get, everything

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
from a simple
maneuver to anomalies

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:90%
to a flyby or close encounter.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
describe the craft?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir, absolutely.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is it
the typical UFO shape?

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: We've had Tic Tacs.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, typical UFO--
there's a whole range

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:84%
of different types of shapes
that are out there-- diamond,

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:90%
pyramid, oval, cigar shape.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Tic Tac has been popping
up a lot these days.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does it take
to investigate a case, Jeremy?

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Sometimes you
can do it real quick.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
it takes me a long time.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Keep in mind we are all--

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's a long time?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I could spend a
couple of weeks on a case.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And, generally,
what do you conclude?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, what
we do is we have

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
a really long, lengthy
checklist of things

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:90%
that we have to rule out.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:90%
And if we can't come--

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got to figure out
if it's a satellite, a drone,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:90%
helicopter, airplane.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
We have tools, things
like Flightradar24.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Heavens-Above is an awesome
website that tracks satellites.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So we got this checklist
that we go through.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't come to a
down-to-earth explanation, what

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
we do is we'll label
it as an unknown.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean it's
an extraterrestrial vehicle

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.667 align:middle line:90%
from somewhere else.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It just means that we went
through our entire checklist,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and we're not able to
identify the object.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Forensic
analyst Seth Feinstein

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
breaks down a UFO sighting
hovering over Denver, Colorado,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:90%
with amazing accuracy.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SETH FEINSTEIN: We had a
little white illuminated object

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
move into position over
the Denver Post building.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
It hovered for a bit and then
took off towards the mountains.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:84%
We had three theories for
what the object could be.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a helicopter.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a drone, or
it was an unknown.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we did
with our photo analysis

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:90%
was to authenticate the video.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
We were able to confirm the
date, the time, and what

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:90%
device took the video.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And we saw no signs of
photoshopping or cloning.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
The object changed direction,
stopped, and started

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:90%
and hovered.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
There was no sound,
but it was distant.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I pulled still
images from the video

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
to be able to conduct
photo forensic tests.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a typical
look for an object

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
in the distance
of, say, one half

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:90%
of a mile to one mile at night.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
A cell phone camera
lens will typically

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
pick up noise and create
artifacts as blurry and fuzzy

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:90%
in their effect.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:84%
My job in the
identification process

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:84%
is to remove any noise and
artifacts that I can remove

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and then to find the
detail and gain clues

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:90%
to make an identification.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.030 align:middle line:84%
The second image I would like
to point out from this case

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:90%
is a luminance gradient shot.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Here, we used a
different settings

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
to define the shape
of the object,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:84%
utilizing light and
shadow reflections.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:84%
With this image, we can see
that the object in question

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:84%
was circular, a circular
window facing the witness.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And there is a jet out to
the right, which appears

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:90%
may have a circular window too.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.580 align:middle line:84%
If this were a helicopter,
I would see a tail.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I would also see air disturbance
from rotating blades or maybe

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:90%
the blades themselves.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
If it were a drone, I would see
night or anti-collision lights.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I would see an air
disturbance of fan blades.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly,
a drone is remote

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:90%
controlled from the ground.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:84%
The object flew far
away, too far away

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to be remote controlled, remote
controlled from the ground.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:84%
With a 90% surety, this
object was determined

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:90%
to be an unidentified object.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
amazing case, Jeremy.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.365 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Yeah, I
was actually there

00:06:21.365 --> 00:06:22.948 align:middle line:84%
when that happened,
believe it or not.

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see it?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: No, we had
a MUFON symposium

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
at a hotel called
the Sheraton that was

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:90%
one block away from that site.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:84%
The individual that
filmed that video

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
was an attendee to
the MUFON symposium.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:90%
He lived up in Canada.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was out walking,
exploring downtown area,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
he caught on tape.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:84%
I was pulling security at
the time at the symposium,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
make sure everybody
paid that came in.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And I actually assigned
that case to myself.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was during that time,

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I was offered a job
at Lockheed Martin.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to hand that
case over to Seth Feinstein

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
because it needed
more attention.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
cases like that do

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
you get where the conclusion
is this unidentified?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: I would say--

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.790 align:middle line:90%
that's a good question.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.233 align:middle line:90%
60% to 70% is my best guess.

00:07:19.233 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: No, no, no,
we could identify it.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, OK.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: And then the rest could
fall into the unknown category,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.360 align:middle line:90%
or it could be an unknown UAP.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 30% to 40%.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, we got a couple
that would fit into there.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So an unknown, I would say,
would be in the 10% bracket.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But we do categorize
unknowns as unknown others.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:84%
That could be an anomalous
light or dimensional type craft.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
unknown UAP, which would

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:90%
be like a solid structure.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we've got
things like hoax, keystroke,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and other case depositions
that we come up with.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, unknowns would be--

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I would say it
ranges on the month.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All you need is one.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Oh, we've
got more than one.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is pretty dramatic.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.418 align:middle line:84%
Does Colorado seem to
have a lot of UFO reports?

00:08:09.418 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I would say so,
yes, sir, especially

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.065 align:middle line:90%
around military installations.

00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
does that tell you?

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Either it's our guys
testing some awesome stuff,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
or it could be,
whatever this is,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:84%
is pulling surveillance on
our military installations.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is it
to get video, like we just saw?

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: It's very important.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:84%
That way, what's
really great is--

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd always recommend when
people are filming at night time

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that you've
got a telephone pole

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:90%
or something in the background.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Don't zoom up on the object.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
This video that we just watched,
you could see the building.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was other
angles that the guy had.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.725 align:middle line:84%
I think the UFO
got out of range.

00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And he had to walk
around the building,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and he got a different angle.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So it gives us a triangulation
of how big the object might

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:90%
be as long as we have some--

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That seemed
like a pretty good size.

00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: If it's a mile away,
it would be a pretty big size.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: And it does look like
what Seth was talking about.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a circular
part of the object.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:90%
And then he called it a jet out.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I guess I would call
it a windowsill.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.091 align:middle line:84%
But it looks like if you
were inside the object,

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
there's a part that's
stuck out from the window.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
In the video, we were
always contemplating on,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:90%
is it a drone?

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Is it not a drone?

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.095 align:middle line:84%
Is there somebody inside it
that's piloting the craft?

00:09:30.095 --> 00:09:31.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it an ET?

00:09:31.395 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: We're trying
to figure that out.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert Bigelow
from Bigelow Aerospace

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
has done a great job
trying to investigate UFOs.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:40.835 align:middle line:90%
You know him?

00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I have met
him personally.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you think?

00:09:43.335 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I think he's
a stand-up guy.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I could tell you--

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.277 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He puts his
money where his mouth is.

00:09:49.277 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, let's
talk about that.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.320 align:middle line:84%
When I met Mr. Bigelow, I
was a young whippersnapper.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:90%
And I was so excited.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
know much about him.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But I was excited at some
wealthy billionaire was

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.700 align:middle line:90%
coming in funding UFO research.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:84%
If I was a billionaire,
that's what I would do, right?

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: So I ran up to
him, and I shook his hand.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, sir,
I just want to--

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Got down on your knee
and genuflected it, right?

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.315 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: No, I didn't
do that much.

00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But I did say, thank
you, sir, for using

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:84%
your hard-earned money
to fund UFO research.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And he chuckled, and he
goes, it's not my money.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:90%
We have sponsors.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And he winked at me and
kind of went over my head

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:90%
But now it totally makes sense.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I was part
of a STAR team.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I was part of a Bigelow
project with MUFON.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting paid to
conduct UFO investigations

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.300 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He just funded a
paranormal research paper

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:90%
that Jeffrey Mishlove won.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was like
a half million dollars.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:90%
He is into this in a big way.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
He's developing little
tiny hotel pods in space.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:90%
He wants to get to that.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Yeah, I think he
had a thing up there called

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Genesis I and Genesis II.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.465 align:middle line:84%
They were like
deflatable modules.

00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
They were almost
like life rafts.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.173 align:middle line:84%
And instead of working
on it and building it up,

00:11:05.173 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
it's already prebuilt. So when
it gets up there, it just--

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.173 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's
prefabbed already.

00:11:09.173 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Yep, it just opens up
like a deflatable module, yeah,

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:90%
very, very interesting.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is his
interest in UFOs?

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.357 align:middle line:90%
Did he ever tell you?

00:11:16.357 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: No, I didn't.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know him.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It was a brief interaction
that I had with him.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.902 align:middle line:84%
But he's been fond of the
paranormal for a long time.

00:11:24.902 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he's
into it in a big way.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the Star team?

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: The STAR
team is an acronym

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that stands for Strike
Team for Area Research.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be like a
rapid response special unit

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
to deploy anywhere in the United
States that deals with UFOs

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:90%
that might have evidence.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:84%
During the time when Bigelow
started that project,

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
it was called the STAR
Impact Project, SIP.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And what it showed
was that MUFON

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:84%
was very capable of having a
quick reaction force to deploy

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.240 align:middle line:90%
at a moment's notice.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
We'd get to a site in
less than 24 hours.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Everything was taken care
of, your hotel, your flight,

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:90%
per diem, you name it.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:84%
You just needed to make
sure your car was packed,

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:90%
and you were on call.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you were all very
professional at what you do.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the
most astounding case that

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:90%
has come across your desk?

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, there
are many of them.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about the one that
I did for the Bigelow case

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:84%
when Robert Bigelow
was funding MUFON.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I had a case where
two individuals

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:90%
were driving on the road.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.160 align:middle line:90%
They were on vacation.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
They were heading back to
Texas, and a UFO took them

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.095 align:middle line:90%
while they were in the car.

00:12:32.095 --> 00:12:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:39.020 align:middle line:84%
They had no memory
of the abduction,

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:84%
but their memories
came back to them.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:90%
So they had a rental car.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:90%
They were driving down the road.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Basically, a
saucer-shaped object

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
came over, like the
bottom of a pie plate,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:84%
came right over the
top of their car.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:90%
They tried to outrun it.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:90%
It zipped off.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the passenger
looked out the window

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and saw this being running
through the desert,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.720 align:middle line:84%
coming at them,
about to intercept.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:90%
He said it was a naked man.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.175 align:middle line:84%
But his head was like
an upside down teardrop.

00:13:07.175 --> 00:13:08.507 align:middle line:90%
Like, it was a big head.

00:13:08.507 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like it
was having a hard time

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.173 align:middle line:90%
holding its head up.

00:13:11.173 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind
they're driving about--

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the typical
alien Greys we hear about.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:90%
This one was tall.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
He was going about
85 miles an hour.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And this thing was able
to catch up to the car.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it got up to the
car, there was a big loud bang.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And the whole car
filled up with, like--

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:84%
not described as
white light, but more

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:84%
like you stuck your head
in a mayonnaise jar,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.620 align:middle line:84%
or you stuck your
head in a Kleenex box.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And then there was no
sound, and they felt

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.990 align:middle line:90%
like they were being lifted up.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was an
aggressive encounter.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: For these two guys, yes.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was
that's all they remember.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But all they know is they
were driving down the road.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.820 align:middle line:90%
And the guy was like--

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
the passenger was like,
hey, didn't we hit somebody?

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, no,
we didn't hit nobody.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:84%
He was like, yeah, remember
that loud bang that we had?

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh, yeah, that's right.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were concerned
because it was a rental car.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So they pulled off
the side of the road.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.607 align:middle line:84%
And they got out, and they
started to walk around the car.

00:14:07.607 --> 00:14:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's when their
memories all came back to them

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.805 align:middle line:90%
because they were feeling--

00:14:11.805 --> 00:14:13.570 align:middle line:90%
it was like taken from them.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So Bigelow Aerospace was
very interested in getting

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.242 align:middle line:84%
that vehicle so we can get
some readings off of that.

00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get some tests done.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: And from what I
heard, my part of the job

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:84%
was just to interview
both witnesses

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:90%
and write up a report.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Several years later,
I bumped into one

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:90%
of our science advisors.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:90%
His name was Chuck Malden.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:84%
His theory was there was a
high electromagnetic radiation

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:90%
coming off the windshield.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And his theory was that
when they took them,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.180 align:middle line:84%
they didn't open the
doors to pull them out.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
They pulled them
through the windshield.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll try to explain that.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dissolved
them right through.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Just pulled them through.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: So that was a
very interesting case.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:90%
I've had a lot more.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.930 align:middle line:90%
But that one, I'll never forget.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of volunteers
left MUFON over some government

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Oh, no, the best.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Bigelow Aerospace.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, when Bigelow stepped
in, he was only there

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:10%
for a short time, about a year.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:10%
And then it was a project.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And MUFON is not a
government entity.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
We're a nonprofit organization.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:90%
We're all volunteers.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Some people just didn't
like a billionaire

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
coming in and
funding UFO research.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So we did have some
good people leave.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:84%
But it really didn't
disrupt MUFON at all.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
It actually showed
that MUFON was

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:84%
capable of deploying
at a moment's notice,

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
that we were very
capable of doing so.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeremy, you have
different levels of cases.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From one to what,
how far out do they go?

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, actually,
during the Bigelow,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:84%
it was categories
one, two, and three.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:90%
But now we have five categories.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.407 align:middle line:90%
I can briefly explain that.

00:15:47.407 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what
does each category mean?

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: So a level
one, basically,

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
what we use is the Jacques
Vallée classification system.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So a level one would be an
anomaly, a maneuver, a flyby,

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:90%
or a close encounter.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
To become a level
two, you have to have

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:90%
some kind of physical effects.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So that could be a crop
circle or a tree branch broken

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:84%
or even a physical effect on
a person, say, a headache or--

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A burn.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: A burn or a landing
trace evidence or poltergeist

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I can go on and on
about that but some kind

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:90%
of physical effect.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, to go from two and
three, that's real simple.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Three is beings observed, so if
you saw an entity, either way.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go
to four, that would

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
be abduction, reality
transformation,

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
which I've gone through
that personally,

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:90%
or near-death experience.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, level five is
injury or death.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
So those are the categories.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
had people die?

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: No, I've never had a
case where someone has died.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But you hear through the lore
out there in the UFO community

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that things like
that have happened.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Pilots disappear.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.629 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.629 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:84%
There are some strange
stories that are out there.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was Bigelow
the only one who funded?

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Actually, like I
said, when I shook his hand

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him, thank you,
sir-- or I didn't ask him.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.263 align:middle line:84%
I said, just thank you, sir,
for funding UFO research.

00:17:24.263 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And he winked at me, and
he goes, it's not my money.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:90%
We have sponsors.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.165 align:middle line:84%
Later on down the road,
I found out that--

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:31.040 align:middle line:90%
and it's not just me.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:84%
We all found out-- that the
Defense Intelligence Agency

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.490 align:middle line:84%
was funding UFO research
during that time between 2008

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:90%
and 2009.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And Bigelow got a big
chunk of that money.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So that money trickled
down to pay people

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
like me to go conduct
UFO investigation.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What conclusions
did you reach?

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.722 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, for that case
alone, that was an unknown.

00:17:51.722 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I also had another one that
we were able to identify.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I only had two
during the project.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.290 align:middle line:90%
We didn't do every UFO case.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:84%
It had to be a
high category case.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
The findings, just from my
end, one case, an unknown.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
But for Bigelow's findings
or whatever he gathered,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:90%
That's unknown to me.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
get certain emails

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:84%
from government agencies
or anything like this?

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:90%
I heard rumors about that.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Sure.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So I had a STAR team manager,
and he was a MUFON guy.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And he would assign
me the cases.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.073 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day, I
received an email.

00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, keep in mind
I'm ex-military.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.053 align:middle line:84%
I used to be in the
82nd Airborne Division.

00:18:32.053 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You jumped out
of planes, didn't you?

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.928 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Jumped out of a
perfectly good airplane.

00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, so I see an army
email come across my desk.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:90%
It had a man's name.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to say his name.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But the email address was
his name @usarmy.mil, M-I-L.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So I open it up,
and I'm reading it.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded like they
were assigning me a UFO case.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well, what
does the Army have to do with--

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to put
two and two together.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But I'm assuming
that was an accident.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, I'm
an investigator.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I just can't sit
there and contemplate

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:90%
what this is all about.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So I picked up the phone
and called the guy.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.525 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to
him on the phone.

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:90%
But he worked in the Pentagon.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked him, what does
this got to do with MUFON--

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I'll just make
this long a short--

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:84%
he goes, oh, well,
I'm a MUFON member.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.813 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also a
MUFON investigator.

00:19:25.813 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.258 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: And I was
like, OK, well, it

00:19:28.258 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:90%
just kind of went over my head.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I was just so gung-ho
about doing the case that I

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:90%
didn't really care about this.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But when you think about it now
and look back on it, of course,

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:90%
it makes sense.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have a
chance to analyze the Tic Tac

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:90%
video from the fighter jets?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: I am not a photo analyst.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell
you that one thing

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that's uncanny to me
about the Tic Tac UFO--

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and I've had a lot of people
argue with me about it--

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
is that there's
these prongs that are

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the Tic Tac.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:90%
They're bent backward Ls.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.580 align:middle line:90%
They come like this.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen that type of
antenna on other devices

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that we make, like
intercontinental ballistic

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.300 align:middle line:84%
missiles or torpedoes
or whatever.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm just curious why
aliens need antennas.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of on the fence
on what the Tic Tac UFO is,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's ours, or
it's somebody else's.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Until we get more evidence
or more information

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:90%
coming forward, then I'll know.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:90%
But it's still an unknown to me.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it were
somebody else's,

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.388 align:middle line:84%
don't you think they would be
using it against us by now?

00:20:32.388 --> 00:20:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I've thought
of many theories.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be interesting to
fly some of our high-tech craft

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
around fighter pilots
and see how they react?

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.007 align:middle line:84%
If it is a foreign country,
then we're in a lot of trouble.

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You risked
the fact that they

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:90%
may shoot against you.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Correct.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
Commander Fravor

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.360 align:middle line:90%
was doing a training mission.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he had live ammo.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ammo.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:53.680 align:middle line:90%
And maybe they knew that.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Maybe.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go
down to conspiracy

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:90%
train on what-if scenarios.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:90%
But it is interesting.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the flight
characteristics of this Tic

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Tac, the inertia effect
would probably kill a pilot

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:90%
as fast as it's going.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So if there is
somebody on board,

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.678 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be some kind
of anti-inertia device,

00:21:16.678 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:84%
especially when they're
dropping a mile a second.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the cameras
important on the fighter

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:90%
jets to record these things?

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I hope somebody
in Raytheon or somebody

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:84%
out there has come up with
a awesome camera system that

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.510 align:middle line:84%
is specifically
designed to detect UFOs,

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:84%
especially when
they're invisible.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you could pick
up their heat signature

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:90%
or whatever they have.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's important, but will
we ever get to see this stuff?

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.325 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hope we do
in the near future.

00:21:45.325 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you flew a lot.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see
anything strange?

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Oh, yes, I've had a
multiple of UFO encounters

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
through my entire life, so never
out of an airplane or anything

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:90%
like that just, on the ground.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
cameras you've seen,

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
have you seen any strange
videos other than the Tic Tac?

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I've actually seen
more Tic Tacs.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:90%
We had a case--

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.110 align:middle line:90%
it was a Texas case.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:84%
But it was a military
intelligence officer

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
that took a picture
outside of a C-130.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
a C-130 or C-17.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's a Tic Tac
flying right out the window.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.390 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they, Jeremy?

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.407 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:22:21.407 --> 00:22:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: I don't know.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I guess we could just
label it as unidentified.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have these
pilots come forward?

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Most of the time, when
it's spectacular footage,

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:90%
they want to remain anonymous.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a doctor-patient
confidentiality agreement.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:90%
We don't talk about these cases.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, one of
the big stories, of course,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:84%
are the congressional
hearings in the UFOs

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
with these incredible
military whistleblowers, guys

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:90%
who are not lying.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
They're telling the
truth about what

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:90%
they've seen and witnessed.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, I've been
watching this case,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's been
evolving over time.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Just recently,
David Grusch, he's

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:84%
a decorated military
intelligence officer.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And he's putting his butt on
the line to come out big time.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And his wife has
been threatened.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:90%
He's been threatened.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:90%
And right now--

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the pilot Ryan Graves?

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Whoever's in charge of
these projects and operations

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
definitely don't want
this to be disclosed.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing whatever
they can to discredit

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:90%
the whistleblowers.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
What really makes my blood
boil is that they put out

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
a psychological-- they actually
leaked his medical records

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
of him having post-traumatic
stress disorder to try

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:90%
to show that he's not credible.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.030 align:middle line:84%
If he wasn't credible,
they would have--

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and if that was a problem, they
would have jerked his security

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:90%
clearance away from him.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Immediately.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: So as me being a
veteran, that makes me mad.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I think this guy is
an American hero.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the
future, this will go down

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
in the history books,
not just for America

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:90%
but for the whole world.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's talk about
Ryan Graves and David Grusch

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and show people
watching "Beyond Belief"

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.860 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:10%
>>RYAN GRAVES: In 2014,
I was an F-18 Foxtrot

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:10%
pilot in the Navy Fighter Attack
Squadron 11, the Red Rippers.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:10%
And I was stationed at NAS
Oceana in Virginia Beach.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:10%
After upgrades were made
to our jets' radar systems,

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.890 align:middle line:10%
we began detecting
unknown objects operating

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:10%
in our airspace.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:10%
During a training mission
in warning area Whiskey-72,

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:10%
10 miles off the coast
of Virginia Beach,

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:10%
two F-18 Super Hornets
were split by a UAP.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.980 align:middle line:10%
The object, described
as a dark gray

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:10%
or a black cube inside
of a clear sphere,

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:10%
came within 50 feet
of the lead aircraft

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.228 align:middle line:10%
and was estimated to be
5 to 15 feet in diameter.

00:24:43.228 --> 00:24:45.520 align:middle line:10%
The mission commander terminated
the flight immediately

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:10%
and returned to base.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:10%
Soon, these encounters
became so frequent

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:10%
that aircrew would
discuss the risk of UAP

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.277 align:middle line:10%
as part of their regular
preflight briefs.

00:24:53.277 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:10%
>>TIM BURCHETT: Has the
US government became aware

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:10%
of actual evidence of
extraterrestrial otherwise

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:10%
unexplained forms
of intelligence?

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.427 align:middle line:10%
And if so, when do you
think this first occurred?

00:25:03.427 --> 00:25:05.510 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID GRUSCH: I'd like
to use the term nonhuman.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:10%
I don't like to denote origin.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:10%
It keeps the aperture
open both scientifically.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, like I've discussed
publicly, previously in 1930s.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCY MACE: If you believe
we have crashed craft,

00:25:18.815 --> 00:25:22.130 align:middle line:84%
as stated earlier, do we have
the bodies of the pilots who

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:90%
piloted this craft?

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUSCH: Biologics came with
some of these recoveries, yeah.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.302 align:middle line:84%
>>MACE: Were they, I guess,
human or nonhuman biologics?

00:25:32.302 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUSCH: Nonhuman, and
that was the assessment

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:10%
of people with direct
knowledge on the program I

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:10%
talked to that are currently
still on the program.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:10%
>>RYAN GRAVES: In
the 2003 timeframe,

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:10%
a large group of
Boeing contractors

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:10%
were operating near one of the
launch facilities at Vandenberg

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.870 align:middle line:10%
Air Force base when they
observed a very large 100

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:10%
yard sided red square approach
the base from the ocean

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:10%
and hover at low altitude over
one of the launch facilities.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:10%
This object remained
for about 45 seconds

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:10%
or so before darting
off over the mountains.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.020 align:middle line:10%
There were reports
of other sightings

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.630 align:middle line:10%
on base, including some
aggressive behaviors.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:10%
These objects were
approaching some

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:10%
of the security guards at rapid
speeds before darting off.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.500 align:middle line:10%
And this is information
that was received

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:10%
through one of
the witnesses that

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:10%
have approached me at
Americans for Safe Aerospace.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT GARCIA:
Mr. Grusch, finally,

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.472 align:middle line:10%
do you believe that
our government is

00:26:23.472 --> 00:26:25.255 align:middle line:10%
in possession of UAPs?

00:26:25.255 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUSCH: Absolutely.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:10%
Based on interviewing over
40 witnesses over four years.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:10%
>>GARCIA: And where?

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:10%
>>GRUSCH: I know
the exact locations.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:10%
And those locations were
provided to the Inspector

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:10%
General and some of which to
the intelligence committees.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:42.280 align:middle line:10%
I actually had the people
with the firsthand knowledge

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.490 align:middle line:10%
provide a protected disclosure
to the Inspector General.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is just
beginning, Jeremy,

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:90%
to become an amazing story.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm excited about it.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: I'm excited about it too.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.082 align:middle line:84%
From what I've heard
through the grapevine,

00:26:55.082 --> 00:26:58.240 align:middle line:84%
there's more
whistleblowers that have

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.600 align:middle line:90%
more explosive information.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's the drip, drip, drip
and then flood of information

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:90%
that's going to be coming.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
biologics that he hinted about?

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.600 align:middle line:90%
How important is that?

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I've looked at the
definition of biologics.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.195 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to understand why
they use that terminology.

00:27:17.195 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:84%
They changed their acronyms
around, like UFO to UAP.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they changed
the UAP to, what was it,

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:90%
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Now it's Unidentified
Anonymous Phenomenon.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to NHI,
which is nonhuman intelligence,

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm correct on that.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically, what he's
saying is it's not us.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.350 align:middle line:90%
He would have used a term human.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's obviously
something else.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we'll be
able, in the near future,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.190 align:middle line:84%
to get to see what
these things look like.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:90%
To me, disclosure is happening.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But I've been involved in this
UFO stuff for a long, long time

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:84%
that it's nice
that we got talking

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:90%
heads talking about this stuff.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
real disclosure

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the day where
we get to hold it in our hands.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.420 align:middle line:90%
We get to touch the metallurgy.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.680 align:middle line:84%
We get to experience
it for ourselves.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kick the
tires, so to speak.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking forward to that.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's probably
some really awesome satellite

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.560 align:middle line:84%
footage and fighter jet footage
that hasn't been disclosed yet.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
forward for that.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.253 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be amazing.

00:28:30.253 --> 00:28:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jimmy Carter
wanted to know about it.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barack Obama
wanted to know about it.

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton wanted
to know about it.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if they ever
got their answers.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I heard that Jimmy
Carter received a briefing.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.070 align:middle line:84%
During that time, George Bush
was the director of the CIA.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And he basically told him, you
have to have a need to know.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.320 align:middle line:84%
But I think Jimmy did
finally get his UFO briefing.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And when he came out,
he wasn't the same man.

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:84%
He was visibly shaken and
disturbed sobbing, so to speak.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what was told.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we
can go back to Nixon.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.873 align:middle line:84%
Nixon was good friends
with Jackie Gleason.

00:29:12.873 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The comedian.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: And one day, Jackie
Gleason, a car pulled up,

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.110 align:middle line:90%
and it was Richard Nixon.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.793 align:middle line:90%
No Secret Service, nobody.

00:29:19.793 --> 00:29:20.960 align:middle line:90%
He was like, get in the car.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:90%
I want to show you something.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And they drove him down
to an Air Force base.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Homestead in Florida.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I was trying not to--
yeah, Homestead, Florida.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Went there and basically showed
Jackie Gleason the bodies.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.415 align:middle line:84%
And Jackie Gleason's wife
said that changed him.

00:29:35.415 --> 00:29:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shocked him.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Shocked him.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:84%
He didn't eat for
a week, kind of

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.110 align:middle line:90%
lost his funny sense of humor.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, Jackie
Gleason and Nixon,

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.610 align:middle line:90%
they were good golfing buddies.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And they would talk
about UFOs all the time.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gleason was
obsessed with it.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:51.578 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:29:51.578 --> 00:29:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think disclosure will

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.158 align:middle line:84%
happen besides the
hearing we just saw?

00:29:56.158 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I believe it will
happen in your lifetime,

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.970 align:middle line:90%
in my lifetime, sir.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But my definition of disclosure
is holding the evidence--

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does the
government say, Jeremy?

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:10.140 align:middle line:84%
How do they admit after all
these years they held back

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:90%
information from us?

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.510 align:middle line:90%
What did they say?

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: That's a tough one.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:84%
It would be wise
if they go back--

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I know we've heard
Roswell a thousand times--

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.310 align:middle line:84%
but go back to the
history of ufology

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
to the normal people that are
not into this kind of stuff,

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
get them up to speed so we don't
cause a panic, like yelling

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.070 align:middle line:90%
bomb and fire on an airplane.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure there's good
and bad involved in this.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
they're going to do this.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested to see
in how it plays out.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But for you and me,
just show us the stuff.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of people out there

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:90%
that don't even believe in this.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're about to have the
rug pulled out from under them.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think what they will
say is, for defensive purposes,

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.880 align:middle line:84%
we needed to keep this
confidential within our country

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:90%
and with our allies.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.750 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't go public with it.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But if we did, it would
affect some of our enemies

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:90%
who are truly out there.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Oh, that reminds me
of what Colonel Corso said.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.133 align:middle line:84%
He authored the book
"The Day After Roswell."

00:31:19.133 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: He basically said
that they had the technology.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:84%
They would give it to people
that were working on it,

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it was Purdue
University or wherever.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, figure
out how it works

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and then give it back to
us for the competitive edge

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.010 align:middle line:90%
of the military.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you folks
within MUFON say, why now?

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Why are they beginning
to do this now?

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, we do say that.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:84%
There's been many
discussions where

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I've had a guy say
this is the same thing

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.200 align:middle line:84%
that Donald Keyhole
did back in the day.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.550 align:middle line:84%
This is nothing
new under the sun.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to argue
with that because this

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.810 align:middle line:84%
is the first time in
Congress that they brought up

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that we do have crash
recovered vehicles.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And David knows the location,
and that we do have bodies.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.520 align:middle line:90%
And so this is history.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.852 align:middle line:84%
I know this is a big step
forward for this movement,

00:32:11.852 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:84%
if that's what you
want to call it.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I call it searching
for the truth.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't bring
up Roswell specifically

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.770 align:middle line:90%
during the hearing.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't hear that.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: No, no, but it just meant
that it's not something new

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.080 align:middle line:90%
that's just started right now.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.200 align:middle line:84%
This has been going on way
before you and me been around.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you excited
about the future?

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: I am.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm really hoping that a
lot of these black projects,

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
technology will come out

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:84%
so it can benefit us instead
of being locked in some vault.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking
medical advancements,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:84%
propulsion advancements that
could really benefit mankind.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're an
intuitive guy, Jeremy.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.510 align:middle line:90%
What does your gut tell you?

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: My gut tells me that
we're not being told the truth.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Still.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But there's a little
bit coming out.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I think we will
get to the truth.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
somebody with an agenda.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they might push this in
saying that they're a threat,

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.810 align:middle line:84%
so they get more money
for their defense budget.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:22.880 align:middle line:84%
That's just an
example out of many.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I do feel that there is
something misleading going on.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.757 align:middle line:84%
But I'm keeping a skeptical
and open mind about it.

00:33:30.757 --> 00:33:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem to imply
that there's something

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:90%
dangerous about some of these.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think so.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I think they would have
destroyed us a long time ago.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Correct.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I think the only time that
they did become dangerous

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:84%
is when we're the ones
that would provoke.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So if we are locking on a UFO
or we're going to fire on it,

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.110 align:middle line:84%
then it does make sense
that they would retaliate.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.530 align:middle line:84%
There's many cases of
stories like this in Vietnam,

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.583 align:middle line:84%
during the Korean War,
where we were engaged--

00:33:56.583 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: World War
II, the Foo fighters.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: The Foo fighters.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But yet most of the time,
when things went nasty

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:84%
with pilots and UFOs, we
initiated first to engage.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seth Feinstein
shares a UFO report

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.389 align:middle line:84%
that appeared over a Space Force
facility in Colorado Springs.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.949 align:middle line:84%
>>FEINSTEIN: At our Colorado
MUFON state meetings,

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.739 align:middle line:84%
people always ask us,
where are the most

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.400 align:middle line:90%
sightings in the state?

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:84%
The most sighting
reports we receive

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:84%
are in the Colorado Springs
area near Cheyenne Mountain

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:35.110 align:middle line:90%
and the Space Force Base.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:38.110 align:middle line:90%
We have a very interesting case.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And the witness says, I was
looking southeast outside

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:48.330 align:middle line:84%
of my window from the third
floor after working out.

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I noticed a shimmering
orb that stood out

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:56.060 align:middle line:90%
in a relatively clear sky.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I viewed the object
approximately three minutes

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.160 align:middle line:90%
before it disappeared.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.610 align:middle line:84%
It moved relatively
slowly but made

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
frequent directional changes,
unable to determine distance

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:90%
from my location.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I am a space ops officer and
have experience as an Air Force

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.860 align:middle line:90%
pilot.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, that sounds to me
like a pilot's report.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:90%
And the photo analysis was on.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:84%
We were able to authenticate
the video footage

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.760 align:middle line:90%
and pull the metadata.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:10%
I made a still
shot from the video

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.940 align:middle line:10%
to attempt to identify the
object floating in the video.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:41.980 align:middle line:10%
8x magnification histogram,
contrast, and noncontrast

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.140 align:middle line:10%
reveal a small white dot.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:47.800 align:middle line:84%
The pixelated image
included with the report,

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.680 align:middle line:84%
the object is clearly
defined in shape.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It is a bell-shaped
object with two antennas,

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.240 align:middle line:84%
like protrusions
coming off the top.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing for sure
about these types of objects

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.190 align:middle line:84%
is that no one has ever
claimed that these objects are

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.210 align:middle line:90%
terrestrial.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, this case
disposition for this sighting

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.660 align:middle line:84%
near the Space Force
Base in Colorado Springs

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:90%
is unidentified.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:20.440 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: We got many of
those at MUFON, tons.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.767 align:middle line:84%
So it's exciting for someone who
hasn't seen things like this.

00:36:27.767 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:84%
But I've been doing
this for 18 years.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.540 align:middle line:90%
And they're a dime a dozen.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:36.280 align:middle line:84%
If anybody is interested in
getting involved and wanting

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:84%
to become an investigator,
MUFON grants that opportunity.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they find you?

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:10%
>>RAY: They can get on MUFON
website, www.mufon.com.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:10%
There's a couple
of tabs in there.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.470 align:middle line:10%
One, you can report a
UFO if you've seen it,

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.900 align:middle line:10%
or there's another tab to
become an investigator.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.730 align:middle line:10%
Just follow the steps.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:10%
And then, usually, we
meet up with the people,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.060 align:middle line:10%
and we train them.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.100 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, we take it from there.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
creation of the Space Force

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:11.020 align:middle line:84%
is done to look at our
enemies or to look at ETs?

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: I actually will
take it to the next level.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I think Space Force has
been around a lot longer.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.790 align:middle line:90%
It's just been finally--

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You may be right there.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.387 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: It might be
finally acknowledged.

00:37:19.387 --> 00:37:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that Space
Force deals with cyberspace,

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.270 align:middle line:90%
satellite communications.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:29.030 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything
to deal with--

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:32.960 align:middle line:84%
actually, they have a
section called Guardians.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I find that interesting.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I don't know, George.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.450 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good question.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Jeremy, thank
you for doing what you're doing.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Keep doing what you're doing.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.340 align:middle line:84%
If people want to get a hold
of you personally, can they?

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.460 align:middle line:90%
You can reach me at--

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:55.970 align:middle line:84%
email is raymufon-- so
R-A-Y, M-U-F-ON-- @yahoo.com.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Also, I'm on Facebook if
you want to friend me.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But I usually don't
talk on my wall.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.620 align:middle line:84%
But I will private
message anybody.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
next future for MUFON?

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Well, there is a lot of
interesting projects going on.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm tight-lipped about it.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:90%
I know some.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:84%
But let me just put
it to you this way.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Congress is talking to MUFON.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RAY: Yes, sir.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think they
will disclose through MUFON?

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: No, but maybe there
might be some opportunities

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.607 align:middle line:90%
in their future.

00:38:29.607 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something mutual?

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Something that
maybe we-- well, yes, we'd

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.170 align:middle line:84%
share information, anything
that they need or vice versa.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we can be utilized.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:84%
That's all me making this up in
my head because I don't know.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.290 align:middle line:90%
But we are talking to Congress.

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeremy, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RAY: Thank you,
George, for inviting me.

I believed in

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.940 align:middle line:10%
when my mother gave me a book
by the late "New York Times"

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:58.000 align:middle line:10%
science writer Walter Sullivan
called "We Are Not Alone."

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And after discussions with
people like Jeremy Ray,

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.250 align:middle line:90%
I realize--

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and one day, I'll be vindicated.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure of that.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
