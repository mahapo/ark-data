>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:10%
Kristy Robinett with us, a
psychic medium, astrologer,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:10%
author of 10 amazing books--

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:10%
in addition to giving readings
and teaching workshops,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:10%
she uses her psychic
ability skills

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:10%
to assist with, guess what,
police investigations.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:90%
That's got to be fascinating.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KRISTY ROBINETT: I love it.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Kind of a
story from my childhood--

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I had an attempted kidnapping
when I was eight years old.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.183 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody
tried to kidnap you?

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Someone did.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And they believe it
was the Oakland County

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:90%
killer in Michigan--

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which I'm
very familiar with--

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.337 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Which
is still unresolved.

00:00:58.337 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:90%
It's still unsolved.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unsolved.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.893 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And my grandfather
from the other side

00:01:01.893 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:84%
came through before the
kidnapper got me to his car

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:90%
and saved my life.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.227 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see the person?

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember him?

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.143 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I do, vividly.

00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:10.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did he look like?

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBINETT: He was taller.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:10%
He was thin.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:10%
He had a camera around
his neck, because he asked

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:10%
if he could take my photograph.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.543 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And before I knew it,
he was dragging me

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:90%
towards the exit of the mall.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:90%
I have--

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That may have been him.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I
believe it was him.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.043 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That may have been him.

00:01:26.043 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBINETT: And I do believe
that they know much more

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:10%
than what they tell the public.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not so sure
it'll ever be solved.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the first
child disappeared,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:90%
his name was Mark Stebbins.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yes.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I was producing
a television show at Channel 2

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And we got a call
for a missing kid.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, generally,
television stations

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
do not report on
missing children.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Right.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
just a flock of kids.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
very strange about this.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.983 align:middle line:84%
And it hit me psychically
in a very strange way.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT:
Intuitively, you knew.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I led with that story.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
My news director, Kristy,
called me up that next night

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:90%
screaming at me.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
How could you lead
with a missing?

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, Dick, this is
going to be a huge story.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
My gut tells me there's
something very wrong here.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then a couple days
later, they found his body.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And then there were more.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then there were more.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So I started kind of programming
myself, my intuitive side,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:90%
to look at unsolved crimes.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that I was
training myself reading books.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And as I got older and
I accepted the fact

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
that I had a gift, which
I think we all do--

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:90%
But you were able to magnify it.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I was.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up working
with law enforcement,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.452 align:middle line:84%
and I still do on
a voluntary basis.

00:02:47.452 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like I
feel like I'm supposed

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to give back from being
saved from the other side.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was your first
law enforcement case that you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:90%
worked with them about?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: It was a
young girl that had

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:90%
gone missing in Columbus, Ohio.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And she
had a little bit

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:84%
of a-- she was actually from
Michigan, which I didn't know.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:90%
She came to me in spirit.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you need
to help find my body.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.557 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote down
everything that I knew.

00:03:15.557 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And normally, I don't
go to law enforcement.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.598 align:middle line:90%
But she was super persistent.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.528 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And so I
contacted Crime Stoppers.

00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I have information.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they look at
you as a possible suspect

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Columbus police did.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They
actually almost put me

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the cop car,
because I drew out a map

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and I had never
been to Columbus.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, this
is way too detailed.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.983 align:middle line:84%
So that was scary, which is one
reason why I'm really cautious

00:03:39.983 --> 00:03:40.783 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have references
with police.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't believe you.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
That's all I needed is to be
up on the stand as the suspect.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But we went to a park, and
I put a stick in the ground.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, she says
she's buried here.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And then they didn't dig.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They said we
have to get more evidence.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.663 align:middle line:90%
And we have to get more info.

00:04:01.663 --> 00:04:03.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They didn't
believe you, did they?

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:05.817 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They did
believe me, ironically.

00:04:05.817 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I was actually really grateful
that they did believe me.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They should have
had a shovel right there.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Right then.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And it was
about a year later.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
They dug right where
the stick was still at.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where you
told them to go.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And she
was right there.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they ever
find her murderer?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yes.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
He is serving I think three life
sentences, because in between,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.633 align:middle line:90%
he killed more people.

00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: It was super--

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.155 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I was so
irritated, because we

00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:84%
could have stopped him
before that happened.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't work
like television.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work like the
shows like "60 Minutes."

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work so fast.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
It works in years
and not in minutes.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The communication
with the other side,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:90%
do they come to you?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Or do you go to them?

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I will
never conjure them.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of open
the doorway and say,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
who wants to
communicate with me?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they find me, kind
of like the Kmart blue light

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:90%
special.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I kind of think
that I have that light.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.152 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, oh,
we're going to talk to her.

00:04:59.152 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:90%
She can see me.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
I'm like, if anybody

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
would like to communicate
with me, come forward.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.772 align:middle line:84%
I'll never pull
somebody through that

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to come through.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like Whoopi
Goldberg in "Ghost."

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I won't do that.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
jump inside you?

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And do you channel
them that way?

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.743 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I have had that
happen, and I don't like it.

00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm too type-A. I'm
too controlling.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't want that
experience at all.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But I'll smell what they smell,
and I'll feel what they felt.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'll see what they saw.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in the
police investigations,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:84%
that was really hard,
because I would see.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I would feel how they
were being murdered.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I would see
what they were seeing.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you feel the pain?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I do.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's horrifying.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if they sadly
got stabbed, do you feel that?

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I will feel it.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:90%
I will feel all of it.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, there's not
a lasting part to that.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:90%
But I will feel the gunshot.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:90%
I will feel being choked.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:90%
I will feel the drowning.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the
spirits bother you,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
you can't sleep?

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yes.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I think they just want
their stories to be told.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.627 align:middle line:84%
They want to be heard, like
we all want to be heard.

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:01.043 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something missing

00:06:01.043 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:90%
in what happened to them.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And they have to get the
word out, don't they?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Sometimes,
it's unfinished business.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they
just like to talk.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had
to tell them, leave me alone?

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Often.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Often.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they offended?

00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Sometimes, yes.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.932 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do they
come back and get you?

00:06:18.932 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Thankfully,
I'm still whole, right?

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: So no.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you
have an aunt that's

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
that loved to gossip

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and loved to talk about
nothing and everything,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
our personalities from
here to there don't change.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So if we have somebody that was
quiet here, on the other side,

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:90%
they're typically quiet.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.353 align:middle line:84%
They're typically
their personalities.

00:06:40.353 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:90%
That's their soul and spirit.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.948 align:middle line:84%
But if you've got somebody
who is annoying here,

00:06:44.948 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be annoying
over there, as well,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:90%
because that's who they are.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Closure?

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Closure, their
story told, sometimes

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:90%
their legacy to continue.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they're upset
their picture's not

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:84%
left, up on the table or that
you're not telling the story

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:84%
right or you're not
telling the story

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:84%
or you're telling the
story completely wrong.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, they just
want, again, to be heard.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a difference
between being a psychic

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.065 align:middle line:90%
and being a medium?

00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: There is.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So psychics are those that touch
into the energy of the past,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:90%
the present, and the future.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And a medium is
somebody who talks

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to those on the
other side or those

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:90%
that haven't crossed over.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kristy, what
are some of the ways

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that those on the other side
try to communicate with us?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They will
send us dreams or visits

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:90%
that are super vivid.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to sort of have
that interaction with them.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:90%
They'll send us coins.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why they
never send us $100 bills.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:90%
But typically, it's coins.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.875 align:middle line:84%
They'll send us
feathers or animals.

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah, because
we're such a sensory human

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that we like things that smell
and we see and we can hear.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have the scent
of cigarette smoke

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
when nobody around
us is smoking.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they persistent
when they do this?

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.953 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Often,
they're persistent.

00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
it's not like a 911.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.293 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if they
have an urgent message.

00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:84%
It's typically
that they just want

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:84%
you to know that they're
around and that they're OK.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Psychic
medium James Van Praagh

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.568 align:middle line:84%
on his Gaia series "Spirit Talk"
talked a little bit about this.

00:08:23.568 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:10%
>> How many of you have had
signs from a spirit that we

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:10%
know they're around?

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.650 align:middle line:10%
And what kind of
signs did you have?

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Electrical.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Electrical.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.259 align:middle line:10%
So any-- exactly.

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:10%
Electrical.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:10%
How many have had electrical
things happen around the house?

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:10%
Lights flickering on and off and
this sort of thing, computers,

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.742 align:middle line:10%
cell phones acting
very strange, right?

00:08:39.742 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times, a
spirit will come

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:10%
through where they can
affect the magnetic field

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.210 align:middle line:10%
of electrical objects.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:10%
And for some spirits,
that's an easy way

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:10%
to come through for them.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:10%
How many people have had
dreams of your loved ones?

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:10%
Mostly all of you.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:10%
Mostly all of you,
too, probably.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:10%
Dreams are the number-one
way that spirits communicate.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:10%
It's the number-one way
they're able to communicate.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why, you might
ask-- and I'll tell you.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.527 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm psychic,
I know you're

00:09:02.527 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:10%
going to ask me that question--

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:10%
is that in the dream state,
when we go to sleep at night,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.310 align:middle line:10%
our spirit body, which is a
replica of the physical body,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.050 align:middle line:10%
is lying within
the physical body.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:10%
And at nighttime, we go to
sleep in the dream state, where

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:10%
spirit leaves the physical body
and goes out of the head area

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.480 align:middle line:10%
and goes over to the
spiritual dimensions.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:10%
Strange, isn't it?

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:10%
So sometimes, you're just
about to fall asleep.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.460 align:middle line:10%
And you feel you're shaking.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:10%
And that's because
your spirit is not

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:10%
leaving the correct
axis of the body,

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:10%
so it comes right back in.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that wild?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:10%
I bet you didn't think of that.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:10%
So what happens is
when we leave and we

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.242 align:middle line:10%
go to the spiritual side
of life at dream state,

00:09:38.242 --> 00:09:39.450 align:middle line:10%
we go to the spiritual world.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.797 align:middle line:10%
We go to those dimensions.

00:09:40.797 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:10%
And you see your friends
and your loved ones

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:10%
and your guides
and your teachers.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:10%
And you will actually
connect with them.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:10%
And as you know, sometimes,
it feels like, wow, this

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:10%
is more than a dream, right?

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:10%
It feels very, very real.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.655 align:middle line:10%
You've had that
experience, right?

00:09:53.655 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:10%
It's just like, oh my gosh.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:10%
And I want to stay here.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.357 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to go
back to Earth, right?

00:09:57.357 --> 00:10:00.038 align:middle line:10%
So I know that when we
wake up in the morning,

00:10:00.038 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:10%
it's like, wow, that
was more than a dream.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:10%
And the way the conscious
mind receives it,

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.077 align:middle line:10%
it does seem like a
dream, but then some.

00:10:07.077 --> 00:10:08.910 align:middle line:10%
And the conscious mind
can't get in the way.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:10%
The rational mindset
doesn't get in the way.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:10%
So it's easier for us to
see it as a connection.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:10%
I call them "cross-overs"
to this side of life.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Kristy,
he makes a lot of sense.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: He does.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he's been in the business,
if you will, for a long time.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and he has a
wealth of knowledge.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the other
side, what exactly is it?

00:10:29.482 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: The
other side, I was--

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is there?

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I was raised
in a religious household.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised that
you go to heaven,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's pretty much
you sing in the choir.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:90%
And there are angels there.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're playing
any instrument.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
on clouds with harps.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: They're on clouds.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Exactly

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And that's not
at all how I've ever seen it.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've been seeing
them since I was three.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So our heaven is the
things that bring us joy.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:84%
It is what we make of what
we want our heaven to be.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is our hell?

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Our hell is just
the same, what we make it to be.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So if we're really
hard on ourselves here,

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:84%
we sabotage
ourselves here, we're

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:90%
living in our own personal hell.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
learn how to find joy

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
or you learn things
that you love here,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
do the same thing

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:90%
when your physical body ends.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.493 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you enjoy
tapping into the other side?

00:11:22.493 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I love to.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:90%
It is so exhilarating.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing to talk to
those on the other side

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and to get their stories
and to get their experiences

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and to learn what
their heaven is like.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know you're
having a heavenly visit, as

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:90%
opposed to a dream?

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They
are very detailed.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:90%
They are very real.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
You will, 15 years later,
still be able to conjure up

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.202 align:middle line:90%
every sense of that visit.

00:11:50.202 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of a heavenly visit?

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Of a heavenly
visit, rather than just a dream.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, dreams also
have a negative context with it.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sometimes.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Someone's like, you
should have done this for me

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.480 align:middle line:90%
while I was living.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:90%
You should have done that.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:90%
And that is not a visit.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:90%
A visit will bring you peace.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:90%
It'll bring you joy.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.380 align:middle line:90%
It'll bring you happiness.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are some souls or
some spirits disenfranchised?

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:90%
They're just not happy.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Personality--
so not everybody

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to tune in to
their own personal happiness.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Their expectations are off.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of like a
million-dollar question, right?

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't anybody happy?

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And circumstances--
you kind of have

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:90%
to make what you make of it.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.023 align:middle line:90%
Life is not easy.

00:12:40.023 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And make it happen.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.815 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: You have
to make it happen.

00:12:42.815 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Law of attraction is a thing.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Law of attraction is a
thing on the other side.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
to take action.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
miss that part.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to do for
yourself, without waiting

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:90%
for somebody to do for you.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kristy, kind of take
us through the process of death.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the
person the minute

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
they have died with
their physical body?

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: So what happens
is they're met, typically,

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
by their loved ones on the
other side, their guardian

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.053 align:middle line:84%
angel that's followed
them through birth.

00:13:17.053 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they at the
bedside of where they

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:90%
are when they die, let's say?

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They kind of
have to make the journey

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And through
that journey, we

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
see it replicated a lot of
times and seeing the things that

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
happened in their past,
the things that went right,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:90%
the things that went wrong.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Some people will
call it "purgatory"

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.085 align:middle line:84%
because those things
are really hard to see.

00:13:41.085 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
my life flashed

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:90%
before my eyes type of a thing.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:90%
And it can be hard.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some people
won't make the entire journey

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
to heaven, because
they get stuck,

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.940 align:middle line:84%
worried that maybe they didn't
live their most authentic life.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
they get stuck in?

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I call
it the "in-between."

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.593 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Purgatory?

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Sort of kind of.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Limbo?

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Some people
think we're in purgatory now.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never know.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:90%
We could be in hell now.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Exactly.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.590 align:middle line:90%
So it is something like that.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
we refer to ghosts

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
as being in the in-between
or being in purgatory.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:84%
They're still looking for
business to be finished

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:90%
and healing to be had.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roberta
Grimes, of course,

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:90%
is an expert on the other side.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:90%
I had a chance to interview her.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:10%
>> So let's talk about how
this is all constructed.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:10%
The only thing that
exists is consciousness.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness exists in
a range of vibrations,

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:10%
from the lowest, which is fear,
to the highest, which is love.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:10%
And in the afterlife,
all of it exists--

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:10%
and actually here, too,
although we believe that there's

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:10%
a lot more space than there is.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:10%
But in the afterlife, it all
exists in the same place.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:10%
So what happens when you
die is really simple.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:10%
Your mind is right
now tuned to that body

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.728 align:middle line:10%
on this level of reality.

00:15:01.728 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:10%
And that's why you think you're
in that body, but you aren't.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:10%
You're not even close to it.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Huh.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So what happens when
you die is that your mind,

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:10%
like a TV set, just tunes to
a slightly higher vibration

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Doesn't shut off.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:10%
It's impossible for
your mind to die.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:10%
Your mind is part of eternity.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:10%
There is no time, and
there is no space.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:10%
So if you exist now,
you always existed.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:10%
And you always will exist.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:10%
Time is meaningless
to something that's

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.270 align:middle line:10%
eternal, which your mind is.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, you tune to this
slightly higher vibration.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:10%
And there, you pick up a
whole new solid reality,

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:10%
right in the same place.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.543 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you agree with that?

00:15:39.543 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I do.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And we all are
vibrational creatures.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And that goes with the
negative mindset of people.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
They're tuning into that
frequency of low vibration.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The other
side, is it God-given?

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.505 align:middle line:90%
I'm putting you on the spot.

00:15:55.505 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yes, you are.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we all
have God within us.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:90%
We have God light within us.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And I think we all have--

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:84%
whether it's satanic or the
devil or negative energy--

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And it is the
choice that we make.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to
interview-- still do--

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Mary Ann Winkowski,
who's a psychic medium.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And she had this gift
since she was a child.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And people would invite
her to go to funeral homes

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.798 align:middle line:84%
to see if the dead was
there watching their body.

00:16:26.798 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:90%
And she would see people.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.173 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I have been invited.

00:16:29.173 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She would
tell amazing stories.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:84%
She would see the dead person by
the casket, by the open casket.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yes.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then she would
relay the story to the family.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I have
done the same thing.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.327 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happens?

00:16:42.327 --> 00:16:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: In fact, I had one
that the mom was so irritated.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:90%
She was Catholic.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And she was so irritated that
they had painted her nails red

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:90%
and she had red lipstick on.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:84%
She was horrified,
because that was

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:90%
such a hussy type of a color.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And she immediately told me, you
need to get this red lipstick

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:90%
off of me and these red nails.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And the funeral
director went, got it.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm on it.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they changed it?

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They certainly
did, no questions asked.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.704 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she was happy?

00:17:09.704 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: She was so happy.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates a
haunting, a spirit haunting?

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Someone
who hasn't crossed over

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:84%
to the other side, somebody
who hasn't engaged themselves

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.530 align:middle line:84%
to be convinced
that they are dead,

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:84%
that their physical
life is finished.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
unfinished business,

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
as well, such as
a tragic passing,

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that they think that they're
still going to have life.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And they don't realize that
there's life after death.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.358 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
interesting concept.

00:17:40.358 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: It's sad,
though, if you think of it,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:84%
because if we think that
this is our only life,

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:90%
we have life after life.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Afterlife.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Afterlife.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You believe in
reincarnation then, obviously.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I do.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.702 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have
free will and free choice.

00:17:54.702 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a karmic
type of a punishment,

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
where everybody that has an
old soul or everybody that's

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:84%
been reincarnated had been
serial killers in a past life

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:90%
and so are walking around--

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope not--

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Right.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, that we're walking
around trying to make amends.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we still have
things, soul people that we're

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:17.440 align:middle line:84%
supposed to connect with and
soul journeys that we're still

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.533 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be traveling.

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What keeps a soul
from not crossing over, though,

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Kristy?

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I think,
honestly, it's fear.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In their part?

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.143 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: On their part.

00:18:27.143 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, though,
it's also the family.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't they have help?

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They have
helpers on the other side.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I had one instance where
I had a daughter who was

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.990 align:middle line:90%
at the bedside of her father.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And a stepmother was at
the bedside of her father.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And the daughter
was saying, dad, go.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:90%
You go.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
You go enjoy your
beautiful afterlife.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And the stepmom was
saying, don't leave me.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:90%
How dare you.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't go.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:90%
He felt guilty.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you help
souls cross over?

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I do, but
it's also free will.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't force them.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't push them
off the diving board.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I try to reassure them, and I
bring through their loved ones

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:84%
on the other side to help sort
of walk them to the other side.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So they know that
it's not a trap.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you able to
do that and help them?

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful when it happens.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
that it is successful?

00:19:22.347 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: There's something
about the environment that

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:90%
feels peaceful.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:90%
There's something--

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they thank you?

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: They do.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.797 align:middle line:84%
They have come
back and thanked me

00:19:30.797 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
after they've made their
journey and they've

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.620 align:middle line:84%
done all of their boot
camp on the other side.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it traumatic
for people who die?

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about the
episode that got them there,

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:84%
like a car accident
or something.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But is the effect of the
death traumatic on them?

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Typically not.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Typically, it's one of the most
peaceful, loving experiences.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can take that by
looking at hospice nurses that

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:84%
experience this
day in and day out.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And they sense or they see
the soul go to the other side.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And they call for
their loved ones

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that they're seeing
on the other side.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.715 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
really beautiful reunion.

00:20:10.715 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had people
call my radio show, "Coast

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to Coast AM," with stories of
their near-death experiences.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
want to come back.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Right.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
forced to come back.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're glad
they came back.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.793 align:middle line:84%
But while that
process is going on,

00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:84%
they don't want
to come back here.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: You're
just enveloped

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:84%
in love, that love frequency,
that love vibration, which

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.190 align:middle line:84%
is more amazing than
you can ever feel here.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.333 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest
vibration there is.

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
talked about diseases,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
like Alzheimer's
or dementia, that

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on the
living and the dead.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: So often, those that
have a neurological disorder

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.560 align:middle line:84%
are in a coma, have the
Alzheimer's, dementia,

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Parkinson's that
are at an end-stage,

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:90%
they are between worlds.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:90%
So I often will see them.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Even if their physical
bodies are still here,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll see their spiritual
bodies on the other side.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that's why
they don't cross over.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:90%
They don't pass.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Their physical bodies don't end,
because they don't recognize

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:90%
that they aren't gone.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
They think that they're
getting the best of both worlds

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:90%
with being in the both worlds.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing if
you look at those

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that have Alzheimer's or are
just at their passing state,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that they will communicate very
fluently with their loved ones

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, as if
they're having conversations.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
they think that it's

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:84%
the Alzheimer's or the
dementia that's causing that.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's not.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:90%
They're truly there.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.673 align:middle line:84%
Their loved ones are trying
to help them cross over.

00:21:49.673 --> 00:21:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about people
who don't have illnesses?

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Do they have these
similar traits

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
as these people who
did have the illness?

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Typically not.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.368 align:middle line:84%
But when they go
to the other side,

00:21:58.368 --> 00:22:00.810 align:middle line:84%
as soon as their
brain shuts off,

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:05.670 align:middle line:84%
immediately, they are
connected to the other side.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Heaven.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Heaven.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it?

00:22:07.973 --> 00:22:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: It is
what we make of it.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It is that vibration that
we've put out into this world

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:90%
that we take to the other side.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:90%
And we build our heaven.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily
physical in nature,

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
but it utilizes all
of our earthly senses.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So if we've always wanted
to live in a busy New York

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
setting, that's what
our heaven will be.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:84%
If we've always wanted
to live on a dairy farm,

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:90%
then we've got farms with cows.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's with the people that
we want to spend time with.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to be stuck with
relatives that we don't care

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
or ex-husbands or ex-wives
that we don't really

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:90%
want to spend time with.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.440 align:middle line:90%
It is the heaven that we create.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.293 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a god?

00:22:53.293 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I
believe that there's

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:90%
a higher power that helps us.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You hesitated
a little bit.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I did, because
I do believe that we all

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:90%
have God light within us.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And I don't see
it like the religious factors

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:84%
of a god that's
sitting on a throne

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.735 align:middle line:84%
with a scepter that's
ruling or judging us.

00:23:17.735 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it in that way.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they teach
us that way when we're kids?

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I think it's
to just keep us in line.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the this is bad
and this is good.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And if we know that
there's a dictator that's

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:84%
going to go into the form
of punishment if we do bad,

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:84%
then it aligns us to keep doing
good, the authoritative figure.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
convinced yourself

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
that there is some kind of
intelligent design to all

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:90%
of this?

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I think
we all have free will.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that we have
a book of life that's written

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.710 align:middle line:90%
beginning, middle, and end.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about even
like the Akashic records

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and the libraries that
have every physical part

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:84%
of our life written in it,
I think that everything

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:90%
can be rewritten.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that we're
in this big matrix of a world

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:25.010 align:middle line:84%
where we are stuck in alignment
with what a higher power wants

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.210 align:middle line:90%
us to do.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.140 align:middle line:90%
We have free will.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if we're all
wrong about this, Kristy?

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
What if it's totally different
from what you believe

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:90%
and what I believe?

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Then I'm going to
be in for an awakening, right?

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
say I'm not wrong,

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.940 align:middle line:84%
but I know what
I've seen and I know

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.900 align:middle line:84%
what they've said to me from
the other side coming through.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't align
with what I was raised,

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.950 align:middle line:84%
which is where I feel like
that was a good guide, as well,

00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
because if it was just aligned
with everything that I had been

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
raised with, then I'd
be like, oh, well,

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that was programming
from the past.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's different.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And it shifts and it changes,
and I learn with every spirit

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.290 align:middle line:84%
that I talk to on
the other side.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
so much consistency

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:84%
with people who have had
near-death experiences that

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.370 align:middle line:84%
has been so similar in
nature with their stories

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think
that we're wrong.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
thought about the possibility

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of what happens when you
go, knowing what you know?

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.307 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I don't fear death.

00:25:36.307 --> 00:25:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do not?

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I don't.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't fear--

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
want to check out?

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:40.403 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I don't.

00:25:40.403 --> 00:25:42.673 align:middle line:84%
I want to still be here
for my family, for sure.

00:25:42.673 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And enjoy it.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Absolutely.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
But I don't fear what's
on the other side.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I said, I know
I've been reincarnated.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to do that again.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.742 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I have completely
ended my reincarnation.

00:25:54.742 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
reached your level.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I hope so.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I would like to just sit by a
pool in heaven with my family

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and be like, we're
on vacation forever.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.217 align:middle line:10%
But it is--

00:26:05.217 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And watch
"Beyond Belief" up there.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBINETT: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:10%
And guide whoever
needs to be guided--

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:10%
I'll do that.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But I don't really want to
go through this earthly life

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I'm an empath, so
I feel the pain of the spirits.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel the pain of
human beings and the energy

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:90%
that the world has.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
it's overwhelming.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it-- and
even being a medium,

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
talking to the other side
chips away at my soul

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.030 align:middle line:90%
every once in a while.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And I feel
like I leave pieces there

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.570 align:middle line:84%
when I come back to be
centered and whole here.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I just don't want
to do that anymore.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could
perfect yourself,

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.100 align:middle line:84%
what would you change
about what you do?

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I don't
think I would.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:90%
I think it's--

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd keep
everything the same?

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I think I would.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would have liked--
and this isn't with myself.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I would have liked to have
somebody to communicate with,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to talk to, about the
gift when I was younger,

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:90%
somebody more supportive.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But then I go, well,
maybe I wouldn't

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.640 align:middle line:90%
have done the research.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I wouldn't
have dug so much.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you keep it quiet?

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I did.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did, kept
it within yourself?

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Except for
the attempted kidnapping.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:90%
I did go to my parents.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, grandpa
saved me from the other side.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But before then, they made
fun of the imaginary friends

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:84%
that I had, the imaginary
kids that visited with me.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
humiliating process,

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:84%
like kind of being
made fun of by a comic

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and being in the front
row in the audience.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It was exhausting,
day in and day out.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And I would have liked to
have had a mentor, which

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:84%
I think shows like
this are amazing,

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:03.960 align:middle line:84%
because people don't have
that as a gift to them.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you
offer them speakers

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.880 align:middle line:84%
who resonate with them, who
are like, oh, I'm not crazy.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I have had those
experiences, too.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will you come back
once you go to the other side

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.350 align:middle line:90%
through another medium?

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.565 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.565 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I hope that
I'll be able to still visit

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.865 align:middle line:84%
my great-grandchildren and
my great-great-grandchildren.

00:28:24.865 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In some way.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: In some way.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's through
a medium or not--

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have
mediumistic abilities.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes, we get
advice from a complete stranger.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And we don't recognize
that that's actually

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:84%
a medium, not in profession
but in information

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.440 align:middle line:90%
that's reaching us.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You also have worked
with animals on the other side.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.140 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I have.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised, again, that
animals don't have souls.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.405 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they don't
go to the other side.

00:28:57.405 --> 00:28:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do have souls.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.010 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:28:59.843 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: They do.

00:28:59.843 --> 00:29:02.603 align:middle line:84%
And I saw them, and I've always
seen them on the other side

00:29:02.603 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
because that's
part of our heaven.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
that brings us joy.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time,
the animals bring

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.780 align:middle line:84%
us more joy than human
beings bring us joy.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I've always
seen our loved ones

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:84%
on the other side with animals,
even if it's not their animal.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of animals?

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:90%
All kinds?

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Dogs?

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Cats?

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.327 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: All kinds.

00:29:23.327 --> 00:29:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I even had somebody who
brought a tarantula through one

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:90%
time because that was their pet.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, goats, roosters.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nah.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah, I don't want
to-- that's not-- my heaven

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.610 align:middle line:90%
isn't spiders at all.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a spider
on your shoulder right now.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.902 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: No, I do not.

00:29:35.902 --> 00:29:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I'm kidding.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: But yeah, so
everything from goats to dogs

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:84%
to rabbits to cats and
everything in between,

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.390 align:middle line:90%
anything that brings us joy.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And our pets go
to the other side.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And they stay with our
loved ones on the other side

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.190 align:middle line:90%
until we're there.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And we can reunite
with our animal.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had people
call me who have had,

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:90%
let's say, a cat pass on.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're in bed, and
they see the little paw

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:11.430 align:middle line:84%
prints walking in the bed,
as if the cat never left.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's happening?

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Animals
and children,

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:84%
especially babies
under three, they

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%
have such an amazing ability
to connect to heaven.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.110 align:middle line:84%
They walk around
in an alpha state,

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
which we don't as
humans because we're so

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:31.710 align:middle line:84%
inundated with electronics and
just real-world life stuff.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And so animals don't know that
they're not supposed to visit.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that
they're not supposed

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.720 align:middle line:90%
to go to the other side.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:90%
They don't know that.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.930 align:middle line:84%
There's such an
innocence about them.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.790 align:middle line:90%
So they bring us signs.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.140 align:middle line:90%
They follow the routine--

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.120 align:middle line:84%
They follow the routine
of what they were used to.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So you might hear
their collar jingle.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Or you might find
a toy from them

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that you know that you
threw away or you put away.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it that
if somebody, let's say,

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:06.150 align:middle line:84%
loved owls in their human
life and they die and then

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:84%
the family sees an owl in
the window or something?

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: You recognize it.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's recognizable as a sign.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So if they hated cats
and all of a sudden,

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:84%
cats were coming through, you
wouldn't put that together.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.170 align:middle line:84%
You would find somebody on the
other side that had liked cats,

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:23.700 align:middle line:90%
that have that connection.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But we have totem
guides and totem animals

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that also follow us
through a lifetime that

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:90%
have spiritual messages.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a realistic,
common-sense message often,

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that clarity is often
right in front of us.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.290 align:middle line:90%
And we're so oblivious.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do animals
come to you psychically?

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: They do.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Often, they
come with our loved ones

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.097 align:middle line:84%
on the other side,
our human loved ones.

00:31:54.097 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
just because they

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:84%
want to show that they're
being taken care of

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.180 align:middle line:90%
and they're not alone.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.820 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow bridge states
that they sort of wait

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:84%
in the in-between
until we get there,

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and they walk to the
other side with us.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I actually have never
seen it that way.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that they're enjoying
their heaven before we're

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:90%
in our heaven.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The unfortunate
part of a pet

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.680 align:middle line:84%
is they don't have the life
span that we have as humans.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I've had dogs that live
13, 14, 15 years old.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Can you reach any of them?

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I've had a few that
have passed on.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah,
you've got three of them

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.700 align:middle line:84%
around you, actually, not that
all of them weren't special.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But there are three
that surround you.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:84%
One is sort of a smaller,
lighter-colored dog that's

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's also almost like
a Lab-ish, golden retriever

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.290 align:middle line:90%
type that's there, as well.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:84%
The other one says
that it's just a mutt.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And that one looks like
from your childhood.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.760 align:middle line:84%
They go way back, almost like
it's connected to your mom,

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.560 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could be even
before I remember the thing.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:32:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: It could be.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.783 align:middle line:84%
But typically, you would even
have a picture with that pet,

00:33:02.783 --> 00:33:03.950 align:middle line:90%
that there is a connection--

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She might have that--

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: To that part.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's that small,
little light-colored one

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:11.588 align:middle line:90%
that is around you a lot.

00:33:11.588 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that
must have been one that

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:90%
was with me when I was a child.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: OK.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
in my later life--

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.385 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: You
had larger dogs--

00:33:18.385 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had
retrievers and Labradors.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And that other one that
has that Lab retriever look

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.630 align:middle line:90%
is so loyal to you.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.020 align:middle line:90%
It's so well-behaved, too.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:90%
They were great with my kids.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: That's amazing.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.050 align:middle line:84%
That little tiny-- and it might
be more connected to your mom,

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:84%
as well, because
they keep referencing

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that it's like her mom
that's taking care of her.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had a
dog, a little Schnauzer

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:90%
called Giselle.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: OK.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which they loved.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And Giselle was around
when I was a kid.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.490 align:middle line:90%
But it was their dog.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.320 align:middle line:90%
I never thought of it as my pet.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.230 align:middle line:90%
It's weird.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always thought
of it as it was their dog.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.838 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: It's a little
high-maintenance, this dog.

00:33:58.838 --> 00:34:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, I've
got to be groomed.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had its ears
cropped and everything else.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Exactly.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So for some reason, that
comes to you, as well.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They love that dog.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And it's probably
because you love your family.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're open to the
experiences of having

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:90%
those visits, as well.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they sort
of visit with you, too.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I never saw my father
into pets, except this dog.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Interesting.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.548 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a matter
of fact, once,

00:34:28.548 --> 00:34:31.570 align:middle line:84%
I had a smaller dog
when I was a little boy.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:84%
And I would constantly
pick up the dog.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And he kept telling
me, stop doing that.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.409 align:middle line:90%
Leave it alone.

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:40.830 align:middle line:90%
And I never understood why.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.420 align:middle line:90%
I was four or five years old.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.929 align:middle line:84%
And he said, George, if you
pick him up one more time,

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.989 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take him
back to the pet store.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And now, my dad
was a loving guy.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Right.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I did, and
he took the dog back.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: He did not.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For some reason,
he could not handle

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.820 align:middle line:90%
me carrying this dog 24/7.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.060 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to
put the thing down.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:90%
And so he took it back.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.558 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: He
meant business then.

00:35:07.558 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He said,
you're not ready yet.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: He meant business.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.013 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he did.

00:35:11.013 --> 00:35:13.720 align:middle line:84%
But then later on, they
got this Schnauzer.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:18.410 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because
it's your grandmother that's

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:90%
there, as well.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.802 align:middle line:90%
So it's mom's mom.

00:35:20.802 --> 00:35:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My mother's mother--

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Who is sassy.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.230 align:middle line:84%
She's kind of got a
feisty personality.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I didn't know her
that well, but she died.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:30.990 align:middle line:90%
She had diabetes.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.173 align:middle line:84%
But she lived in
Fitchburg, Massachusetts.

00:35:34.173 --> 00:35:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And dad's been
gone a long time, though.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mine?

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Your father.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Six years.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I was
going to say five.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something like that.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: So he's doing well.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.680 align:middle line:90%
He's not ready for mom yet.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But he had a good run.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.958 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He went to 88.

00:35:44.958 --> 00:35:45.890 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty good.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: That's a good run.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Absolutely.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whenever you
can get in your 80s,

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.270 align:middle line:90%
I think you've done a good job.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I agree.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you go past
the national average, which

00:35:54.045 --> 00:35:56.937 align:middle line:90%
is 78.6, that's pretty good.

00:35:56.937 --> 00:35:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I agree.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.050 align:middle line:90%
And you live your best life.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
your family did.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.251 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does the Bible
say animals do not have souls?

00:36:06.251 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Well,
and that's just it.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there are Bible
verses that sort of reference

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.150 align:middle line:90%
this, too.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: But it's all
human interpretation.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
always sort of gets

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:27.360 align:middle line:84%
me stumbling with regards
to it, because who's to say?

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I've met people,
human beings, who

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.860 align:middle line:90%
I believe don't have a soul.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.880 align:middle line:90%
They're soulless.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can
you be soulless?

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I think if you've
ever sat in front of somebody

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.970 align:middle line:84%
who has taken somebody's life
and has no conscience to do

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:90%
it--

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that pure evil?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: It's pure evil.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without a soul?

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Without a soul.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:49.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not even
a darkened soul?

00:36:49.695 --> 00:36:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: No, I have seen
them where I don't even

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.110 align:middle line:90%
believe that there is no soul.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:90%
It is like a pit.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.812 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have
never heard of that.

00:36:56.812 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: It's frightening.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: It's frightening.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely frightening.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
born without a soul?

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:04.840 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I don't know.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Surely, as a
kid, they were fine.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Then something happened.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.722 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I don't know.

00:37:12.722 --> 00:37:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, I don't think that
they were fine as a child.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
they just turned evil.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
was a darkness always.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Always, which
is really quite frightening.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you be born
physically without a soul?

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.240 align:middle line:90%


00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I think so.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's sort of
a test to human nature.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.200 align:middle line:84%
We all have that
light within us.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Will we let somebody darken it?

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
they may be products

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:84%
of trying to darken that
and take our own light away.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when a soulless
person dies, what happens?

00:37:51.613 --> 00:37:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: They go nowhere.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's done?

00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: It is.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's over?

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: It is.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've worked a lot
of criminal investigations

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and have seen some
pretty horrific people.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Heartless?

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Soulless.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And never really wanting to
dial into that type of energy--

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.640 align:middle line:84%
it's something that I
would prefer not to.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see
souls in humans?

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.745 align:middle line:84%
Do you see an aura around
me or anything like that?

00:38:25.745 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I do see auras.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I always say that I'm not an
aura reader, but I do believe

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and I see and I sense the
energy emitting from people.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Our energy introduces
ourselves to other people,

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.670 align:middle line:84%
sometimes even before
we enter the room.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So we've all had the
experiences where we were like,

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.410 align:middle line:90%
don't like this person.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I feel icky about
going to this event.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:53.840 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a
terrible idea or the opposite.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I feel really good
about this person.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know them, but I
have a really good intuition.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:90%
You're vibrating with that aura.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.630 align:middle line:84%
You're vibrating with
that person's energy.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does a
soulless person look like?

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: A human being.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do?

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: It's not like a
demonic creature of an entity.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.910 align:middle line:84%
That sounds so from
"Supernatural" or something

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.170 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It is a human being that just
has absolutely no conscience.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all?

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:22.583 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: At all.

00:39:22.583 --> 00:39:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's kind of
pathetic for them, isn't it?

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.458 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Which is
also scary, since we

00:39:26.458 --> 00:39:33.540 align:middle line:84%
have such a sad mental health
society now without any help,

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:84%
not that that would be
able to give them a soul.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But they're all mixed in that
same place at the same time--

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:46.350 align:middle line:84%
so those that are just going
through tragic incidences that

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.960 align:middle line:84%
need assistance and those
that are just pure evil.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are some animals
that are evil, let's say.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's face it.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Sure.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.663 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are evil,
mean-spirited animals.

00:39:58.663 --> 00:39:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: There are.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.122 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
to their souls?

00:40:01.122 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:90%


00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I believe that
they also get the chance

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.410 align:middle line:90%
to sort of reincarnate.

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:12.830 align:middle line:84%
They also have that free
will to reincarnate,

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.320 align:middle line:90%
to be something better.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, though, the
animal that is negative

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:24.328 align:middle line:84%
is spun from a
negative human being

00:40:24.328 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:90%
that's mistreating that animal.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're trained
from a negative person?

00:40:27.787 --> 00:40:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Correct.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so they
become negative, too?

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Often.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Not always, but often.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, it's genetics.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
over-breeding or what have you.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you help animals
that have crossed over?

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:41.975 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I do.

00:40:41.975 --> 00:40:43.850 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, they
don't need help, though.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:45.560 align:middle line:84%
They need less help
than the humans.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Pretty much.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd say 90% of the animals,
they just live their best life.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Who wouldn't want to just nap
and eat and drink water and lay

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:90%
on the couch all day long?

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Since you've been
doing this, what

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:04.000 align:middle line:84%
has been the most rewarding
thing for you, Kristy?

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Bringing
healing to people

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:10.280 align:middle line:84%
who didn't believe that
they'd ever find healing.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a
police investigation,

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:15.260 align:middle line:84%
bringing closure to
finding the body,

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.252 align:middle line:84%
bringing the spirit closure,
bringing them closure.

00:41:18.252 --> 00:41:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's
ever really technically

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:25.410 align:middle line:84%
closure in grief, but at least
getting steps towards that.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And I feel so blessed
to be able to bring

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that love through to people and
to bring the other side to be

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.930 align:middle line:84%
that telephone operator from
this side to the other side.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're familiar
with Dr. Eben Alexander?

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yes.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.390 align:middle line:84%
He's been on "Beyond
Belief" with me.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And he had an
after-death experience

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and is a staunch believer
in reincarnation.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.190 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of the evidence that I
now put out and that we discuss

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.110 align:middle line:10%
in "Living in a
Mindful Universe"

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:04.160 align:middle line:10%
has to do with reincarnation.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.287 align:middle line:10%
Now, although most materialist
scientists will say,

00:42:06.287 --> 00:42:07.120 align:middle line:10%
well, wait a minute.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.700 align:middle line:10%
Brain creates consciousness, so
you can't have reincarnation.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.640 align:middle line:10%
There's no way for any sense
of memory to go from one life

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.600 align:middle line:10%
to the next.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.740 align:middle line:10%
Well, that is not true.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.000 align:middle line:10%
The scientific evidence out
of the University of Virginia,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.870 align:middle line:10%
work over more
than five decades,

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:10%
beginning with
Dr. Ian Stevenson,

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.060 align:middle line:10%
a very respected psychiatrist
who studied past-life memories

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.880 align:middle line:10%
in children, that
he fully expected

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.120 align:middle line:10%
to basically debunk or explain
as a typical materialist

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:32.920 align:middle line:10%
scientist.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:10%
But then he found there
are these cases where

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:35.328 align:middle line:10%
he couldn't do that.

00:42:35.328 --> 00:42:36.370 align:middle line:10%
>> It wasn't imagination?

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:37.810 align:middle line:10%
>> It was not imagination.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:39.820 align:middle line:10%
And they would track
these cases down.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.580 align:middle line:10%
They pay attention to children
because children are much less

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.150 align:middle line:10%
likely to be influenced and have
other sources of information

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.540 align:middle line:10%
that they could try and
use to deceive people.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:54.790 align:middle line:10%
But in the UVA database, they
have more than 2,700 cases

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.610 align:middle line:10%
of past-life
memories in children

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:10%
where the best explanation
is really of reincarnation.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.740 align:middle line:10%
The thing that is most
striking about their database

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:08.200 align:middle line:10%
is that 35% of those
2,700 cases, the child

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:10%
has a birthmark that
corresponds to the mortal wound

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.650 align:middle line:10%
of the prior life.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, that is a mind
bender when you understand

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:19.010 align:middle line:10%
the implications of that.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.370 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Ian Stevenson
started that work.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:26.418 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jim Tucker, a very
respected child psychiatrist,

00:43:26.418 --> 00:43:27.460 align:middle line:10%
is carrying on that work.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.560 align:middle line:10%
He's the current head of
division or perceptual

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.330 align:middle line:10%
studies at UVA.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:32.920 align:middle line:10%
But once you start
realizing that all

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.920 align:middle line:10%
that reincarnation information
is real and scientifically

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.410 align:middle line:10%
validated, it
becomes quite obvious

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.770 align:middle line:10%
that you shouldn't be looking
for memory in the brain.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is amazing that
let's say somebody got shot

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.190 align:middle line:90%
in another life and died.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:51.930 align:middle line:84%
They may have some kind
of mark on their body

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.520 align:middle line:90%
where that wound was.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I was always
petrified of fire.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Since I was a baby--

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You must
have died in a fire--

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I am so afraid.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:03.980 align:middle line:84%
You're so afraid of candles
and fireplaces and anything.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.110 align:middle line:90%
I would scream.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And when my daughter was
all of two years old,

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.180 align:middle line:84%
we were sitting
down, playing a game.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And she said, mom,
do you remember

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.660 align:middle line:90%
when you died in that fire?

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no,
can't say that I do.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.440 align:middle line:90%
And she lifted her hair up.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And on the back, she's
got a strawberry mark

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.590 align:middle line:84%
on the back of her neck that
she didn't even know she had.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:24.670 align:middle line:90%
She's two.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this is
where I was burned.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And it all made sense.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scary, though.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Scary.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To know what they went
through in that other life.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: But
it's also reassuring

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.610 align:middle line:84%
to know that a lot of
our fears that we have

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.910 align:middle line:84%
are based on
past-life experiences.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And that way, we can work
through them in this lifetime

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.120 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't tune
into those fears.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is an
old soul, Kristy?

00:44:50.995 --> 00:44:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Somebody
who's been reincarnated.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many times?

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Somebody
that's lived before.

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:56.948 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I don't I don't
understand when people talk--

00:44:56.948 --> 00:44:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought
reincarnation was reaching

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.210 align:middle line:90%
a level of perfection--

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:04.040 align:middle line:84%
call it "heaven" that you
don't come back anymore.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.710 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to reincarnate.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But I've never
believed people who

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:12.713 align:middle line:90%
say that they've had 500 lives.

00:45:12.713 --> 00:45:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah, I'm
not too sure about that.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
you need that many, right?

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I'm not so sure.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.693 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had somebody recently
who said, I've had 37 lives.

00:45:20.693 --> 00:45:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, where
did you get that number?

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:24.500 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, a medium told me.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I go, that's like somebody
just drawing something out

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.710 align:middle line:84%
of a hat and saying, that's
how many lives you've had.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:33.200 align:middle line:90%
I think that we have a few.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.583 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, I
have a great story,

00:45:37.583 --> 00:45:38.750 align:middle line:90%
which I won't bore you with.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:42.245 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up finding my
grave from a past life.

00:45:42.245 --> 00:45:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bore me with that.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:44.400 align:middle line:90%
You found your grave?

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I did.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.408 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:45:46.408 --> 00:45:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: So years
ago, I was single.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And I went out on a blind
date with a gentleman, who's

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:52.010 align:middle line:90%
now my husband.

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.020 align:middle line:90%
I met him-- nice guy.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: He's a great guy.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
between houses, and I

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.760 align:middle line:84%
had a bunny rabbit, a real
bunny rabbit, in my basement.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you want to
come see my bunny rabbit?

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:05.658 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't cue for
anything, by the way.

00:46:05.658 --> 00:46:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a line
that was, Kristy.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And he fell for it.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:09.345 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: He did.

00:46:09.345 --> 00:46:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was probably
really disappointed

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:12.970 align:middle line:84%
that I really had a bunny
rabbit in my basement,

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Darn.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: But I
said, this is Ginger.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And he looked to the side, and
I had a large painting there,

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:22.220 align:middle line:84%
because that's not
where I was staying.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.180 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't put it up.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, where did you
get that painting from?

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, it's
always been in my family.

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I've always felt an
affinity to this painting.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.030 align:middle line:90%
And he turned just ghost-white.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my whole family has
that same painting for years.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Since the 1800s,
they've passed it along.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, it
came from a past life.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I know that I've got a
connection to that past life.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, and my
last name was "Butler."

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:48.830 align:middle line:90%
And he again--

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
that specific--

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Turned ghost-white.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
family that passes down

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.825 align:middle line:84%
that painting's last
name is "Butler."

00:46:54.825 --> 00:46:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is "Butler."

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: And we
found our graves.

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Was it weird looking
at your grave?

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.602 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: It was weird.

00:47:02.602 --> 00:47:03.402 align:middle line:90%
It was weird.

00:47:03.402 --> 00:47:04.440 align:middle line:90%
He has two kids.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.240 align:middle line:90%
I have two kids.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.590 align:middle line:90%
We have a blended family.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was Charles
Butler and Sarah Butler.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And I always wanted my parents
to call me "Sarah," always.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, when you're
18, we'll change your name.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, well, now, I'm 18.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows me by "Kristy."

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.870 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not going to do that.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.350 align:middle line:90%
But they had four kids together.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
was the same name

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:28.172 align:middle line:90%
that he had named his daughter.

00:47:28.172 --> 00:47:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
believe that you're

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:84%
at the end of your
reincarnated lives, right?

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I do.

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And my theory
is the mere fact

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:39.710 align:middle line:84%
that we are talking
about this means

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:44.990 align:middle line:84%
we're at a certain level of
reincarnation, far more than,

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:47.490 align:middle line:84%
let's say, a few other
people who don't get this

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:48.290 align:middle line:90%
or understand it.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Well, think
back to the '70s and '80s,

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:52.110 align:middle line:84%
when Shirley MacLaine
would talk about it.

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
considered she's crazy.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, we talk about it,
even the old soul analogy,

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.140 align:middle line:84%
the metaphor where
people understand it.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now, there
are TV shows on this.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Absolutely.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything else

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: There's so
much support now for it.

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a book that they call
the "Akashic records," which

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:16.090 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be a
record of our life.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.795 align:middle line:84%
Do they include all the lives
we've had or just that one?

00:48:19.795 --> 00:48:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They
include all the lives.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.050 align:middle line:84%
We have a library of our
lives that we can tune into.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
access this book?

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: We can.

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:28.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we do that?

00:48:28.095 --> 00:48:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Meditation.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Meditation's a great way for us
to tune in to the other side,

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.620 align:middle line:90%
to our loved ones.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we want
to read this book?

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I think
a lot of times,

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:41.985 align:middle line:84%
people are so caught
up in not knowing

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:43.110 align:middle line:90%
what their life purpose is.

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:45.150 align:middle line:84%
They're so caught
up in what next.

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing what I'm
supposed to be doing.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And reading your
book of your life,

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.790 align:middle line:90%
which also has a free will--

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:53.940 align:middle line:84%
it can be erased, and
it can be rewritten--

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.060 align:middle line:90%
gives you a guideline.

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.283 align:middle line:84%
And I think that sometimes,
we need that guideline.

00:48:58.283 --> 00:49:00.575 align:middle line:84%
We need an outline, especially
when we're feeling lost.

00:49:00.575 --> 00:49:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
show your future?

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: It
shows you the future

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:08.680 align:middle line:84%
according to the different
paths that you take.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.242 align:middle line:84%
So if you're down the
path, if you're miserable

00:49:11.242 --> 00:49:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and you're down
that miserable path

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
making any changes,

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.500 align:middle line:84%
it may very well show
you a miserable ending.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're open to going
down a different road,

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:24.140 align:middle line:84%
it will show that
to you, as well.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.183 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad you
have this gift of mediumship?

00:49:28.183 --> 00:49:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: For a long time,
I thought I was cursed.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Long time,
thought it was a curse.

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Even a couple years ago, I
was having death threats.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:40.305 align:middle line:90%
And we ended up having to move.

00:49:40.305 --> 00:49:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From people?

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: From people.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How was that
tied into your mediumship?

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I had a book that
came out that was about heaven.

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And they were very offended--

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see--

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: That I was
talking about heaven.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:52.892 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
made death threats.

00:49:52.892 --> 00:49:54.740 align:middle line:90%
Did you get the cops after them?

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I had events.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.343 align:middle line:84%
And that whole season, I had to
have undercover police with me.

00:49:59.343 --> 00:50:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just in case.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.843 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Just in case, which
was crazy that we had to waste

00:50:02.843 --> 00:50:06.830 align:middle line:90%
taxpayer money because I had--

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.563 align:middle line:84%
and it was legitimate
death threats.

00:50:08.563 --> 00:50:09.980 align:middle line:84%
They were going
to set me on fire.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
know who they were?

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:13.578 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Did not,
but they did show up

00:50:13.578 --> 00:50:14.420 align:middle line:90%
at one of my events.

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
have them arrested?

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: They
did not do anything.

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just you
couldn't do anything.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Yeah.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And you can't convert a skeptic.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't make somebody
who doesn't want to believe

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.813 align:middle line:90%
a believer if they're not open.

00:50:27.813 --> 00:50:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did he think,
you were a witch or something?

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: That's
what I kept saying.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.500 align:middle line:84%
It was like the Salem witch
trials all over again.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.090 align:middle line:90%
He threatened to-- they.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.340 align:middle line:90%
There were several of them.

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.640 align:middle line:90%
And they were middle-aged men.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.920 align:middle line:90%
They weren't 20 years old.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they fanatics?

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBINETT: I think that--

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:45.460 align:middle line:10%
I don't think so.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.790 align:middle line:10%
I think that sometimes,
people get afraid of what

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:49.710 align:middle line:10%
they don't understand.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And if they're not
open to understanding

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:58.360 align:middle line:10%
and they're so caught up in
what they believe is the truth,

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:03.160 align:middle line:10%
then they try to snuff
out the things that make

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.630 align:middle line:10%
them have to learn differently.

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad you
have this ability now?

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I am.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
ever give it away?

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:12.080 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBINETT: No.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:12.880 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely not.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.422 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where does
it take you next?

00:51:14.422 --> 00:51:16.780 align:middle line:10%
What's next for Kristy Robinett?

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I love to write.

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:18.940 align:middle line:90%
I love to help.

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.050 align:middle line:90%
I love to heal.

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm on my path, and
I'm really grateful for that.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you had
a spirit that came to you

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:30.162 align:middle line:84%
and needed help and assistance,
you'd be there like that?

00:51:30.162 --> 00:51:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: Absolutely.

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.077 align:middle line:90%
That's what my life path is.

00:51:33.077 --> 00:51:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kristy, for people
who want to track your work,

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:36.407 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you?

00:51:36.407 --> 00:51:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: I'm at
kristyrobinett.com.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And all my books are available
on Amazon, Barnes and Noble,

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:42.880 align:middle line:90%
anywhere books are sold.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
God-given, aren't you?

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:45.745 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINETT: I hope so.

00:51:45.745 --> 00:51:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINETT: Thank
you for having me.

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What an amazing
gift, the ability

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:55.210 align:middle line:10%
to communicate with souls that
have departed and helping them.

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."
