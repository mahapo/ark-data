>> [Background Music]

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:02.903 align:middle line:84%
And I think many people
today don't know what

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:03.937 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:05.138 align:middle line:90%
>> People basically need to keep

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.442 align:middle line:84%
on to help uncover
what really happened.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:10.811 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.746 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.682 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.324 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.261 align:middle line:84%
You know, Cincinnati, one
of my favorite cities.

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:32.266 align:middle line:84%
In Cincinnati, Victor Paruta was
voted the Best Psychic there.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.635 align:middle line:84%
That's not a small
accomplishment.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.336 align:middle line:84%
Victor, welcome to
Beyond Belief.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.471 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:38.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Victor Paruta: It's
good to see you, George.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Always
good to see you too.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.477 align:middle line:84%
You know, for years, I have
been fascinated with the work

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:48.248 align:middle line:84%
of psychic mediums, past
lives, reincarnation.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.883 align:middle line:90%
You do a lot of that, don't you?

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Victor Paruta: Sure.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:55.088 align:middle line:84%
And those are fascinating
topics to me as well.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: When
you started doing this

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.092 align:middle line:84%
and the more you
started doing it,

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:04.131 align:middle line:84%
have you seen anything unusual,
strange about past lives,

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:07.367 align:middle line:84%
about what might be
on the other side?

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Victor Paruta: I've done a
quite a bit of past life work.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.539 align:middle line:90%
And it's one of those--

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.544 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first time I
had a past life regression.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:26.219 align:middle line:84%
I regressed into a life where
I was a little dwarf and--

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.622 align:middle line:90%
little person.

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:36.263 align:middle line:84%
And I got sick and I ended
up becoming mentally retarded

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.433 align:middle line:84%
and I could not care
for myself and I--

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.533 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Wow.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Victor Paruta: --
had to be taken care of.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:42.869 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Different past life.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Victor Paruta: But, in that
lifetime, I was always aware

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.743 align:middle line:84%
of the presence of the
love of God around me.

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:53.347 align:middle line:84%
The second life past
regression that I add,

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:55.382 align:middle line:84%
I was born into a
life of privilege.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:58.418 align:middle line:84%
I was handsome, well-adjusted,
not a problem in the world,

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:01.054 align:middle line:84%
born into one of wealthy
families in the world.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.756 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Totally opposite
to the first one, huh?

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.091 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Exactly.

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:07.961 align:middle line:84%
But in that lifetime, what
happened was I needed a son

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:13.266 align:middle line:84%
to inherit the empire and my
wife only bore a daughter.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I resented both of them,
therefore, making a lot

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
of bad karma that I'm still
paying off in this lifetime.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.841 align:middle line:90%
But it just goes to show

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:24.845 align:middle line:84%
that the more difficult
lifetimes can be spiritually a

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:28.682 align:middle line:84%
lot more valuable than
the lives of privilege.

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:31.551 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I trust you
weren't Henry VIII, huh?

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:32.285 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: I don't think so.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You never know.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.954 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: I hope not.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:34.654 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You never know.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.055 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yeah, but-- yeah.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:39.793 align:middle line:84%
I have had some very difficult
lifetimes doing some regressions

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:41.662 align:middle line:84%
and-- have you ever had
a past life regression?

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.631 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: No, but I was
told by a regressionist,

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:48.368 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how he knew
this, that I came from Atlantis,

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.804 align:middle line:90%
that I had a past life there.

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:55.342 align:middle line:84%
Very strange because I
sometimes have this affinity

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.943 align:middle line:90%
with stories about Atlantis.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.745 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: That might be
where I know you from.

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.013 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Maybe.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.282 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: 'Cause I've had
several past lives in Atlantis.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.117 align:middle line:84%
And the first time
that I got one

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.353 align:middle line:84%
of those past lives is I was
actually visiting Sedona,

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:07.821 align:middle line:90%
Arizona.

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:12.426 align:middle line:84%
And I was staying in
Flagstaff in a hotel,

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:15.796 align:middle line:84%
and an inner voice said, "Go
into your room and lie down."

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:20.267 align:middle line:84%
I laid down on the bed and a
video sort of playing in my head

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.002 align:middle line:90%
of my lifetime in Atlantis.

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:25.672 align:middle line:84%
And it was so vivid
that it changed me.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.074 align:middle line:90%
It changed my life.

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:31.211 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of Atlantian
energy in that area.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.013 align:middle line:90%
And then I was on a cruise ship

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:38.018 align:middle line:84%
and started getting spontaneous
past life recollections

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:39.519 align:middle line:90%
of another lifetime in Atlantis.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.423 align:middle line:84%
So, I know quite a bit
about Atlantis from two

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.525 align:middle line:84%
or three past life
regressions there.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.661 align:middle line:84%
These regressions were
not-- with a hypnotherapist,

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:49.329 align:middle line:90%
they happen spontaneously.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.632 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How come we can't
remember our past lives,

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.301 align:middle line:90%
which could be many?

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:55.869 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Well, absolutely.

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.738 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one of these people
who believe you've had one,

00:03:58.738 --> 00:03:59.873 align:middle line:90%
two or three past lives.

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:01.608 align:middle line:90%
I think we've had hundreds--

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:02.609 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Hundreds.

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.944 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- of thousands
of past lives.

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:07.447 align:middle line:84%
Not only on planet Earth but
in different places as well.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.248 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:08.815 align:middle line:90%
Since the beginning of time.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:09.649 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Exactly.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.219 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we come from here.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.889 align:middle line:84%
I think come from
elsewhere and we take

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.424 align:middle line:90%
on an earthly incarnation

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.393 align:middle line:84%
for the lessons that
we learned here.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
This is an earth school
where we learn love

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.766 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom, or love for wisdom.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.669 align:middle line:84%
And how to treat one another,
and that's what we are learning

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.472 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
system of incarnation.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:35.842 align:middle line:84%
But yes, we come from
many different places.

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:37.511 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But we don't
remember them, why not?

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.947 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: We don't remember them
but the memories are lodged

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:45.519 align:middle line:84%
within us and that is
absolutely unmistakable.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:49.055 align:middle line:84%
People who have phobias, for
example, people who are afraid

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:52.392 align:middle line:84%
of fire or water have
died by those means

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.628 align:middle line:90%
in previous lifetimes.

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:58.932 align:middle line:84%
And you go to a place
for the first time.

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first time
I ever went to London,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.669 align:middle line:90%
England, I got off the plane.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.737 align:middle line:90%
I knew where I was.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:05.872 align:middle line:90%
I had the sense of familiarity.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.541 align:middle line:90%
I've been here before.

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:11.711 align:middle line:84%
And so, you've got to
pay attention to your,

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:90%
it's called, resonance.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.049 align:middle line:84%
Most of us within
ourselves have this feeling

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:19.686 align:middle line:90%
of truth or something.

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:23.423 align:middle line:84%
And so, let's say you and
I met for the first time.

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:24.991 align:middle line:84%
We feel comfortable
with each other

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.993 align:middle line:84%
or we feel attracted
to each other.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.029 align:middle line:84%
That could be an
indication that we're friends

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.597 align:middle line:90%
from a previous lifetime.

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:31.965 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: No doubt, no doubt.

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:34.668 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: But we've all met people
who, very first impressions,

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.703 align:middle line:90%
you just, you know, stay away.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:38.104 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.739 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And that's-- it could be
where you're meeting an enemy

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.575 align:middle line:84%
from a previous lifetime
or somebody

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
that you're not very
happy to see

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.613 align:middle line:84%
because you've had an incident
with them that was not pleasant

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:47.847 align:middle line:90%
in a previous lifetime.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I'm convinced,
Victor, that in past lives,

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.554 align:middle line:84%
the people who we are associated
within our current life,

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:58.625 align:middle line:84%
we all intermingle
somehow in various aspects.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:01.795 align:middle line:84%
But the real close
people that were

00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:04.197 align:middle line:90%
in our lives today probably were

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.966 align:middle line:84%
in our lives then,
don't you agree?

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: I agree.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.268 align:middle line:90%
There are soul groups.

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:11.171 align:middle line:84%
And so, there are groups of
people that choose to incarnate

00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:14.207 align:middle line:84%
at the same time,
whether be on earth.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.742 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're here.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:90%
And you help each other.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.144 align:middle line:90%
You become friends.

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:19.746 align:middle line:84%
These will be your
closest circle of friends.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.915 align:middle line:84%
These could be your
lifelong friends.

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:25.685 align:middle line:84%
Well, unless you have the karma,
the karma of having a child,

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:29.623 align:middle line:84%
giving birth for a child or
being the parent of a child is

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:32.993 align:middle line:84%
that they will return the
favor in a future lifetime.

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.728 align:middle line:90%
You will be their child.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.229 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's always
what you put

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.833 align:middle line:90%
out you receive in an equal way.

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:42.736 align:middle line:84%
And it's the beauty
of reincarnation.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.971 align:middle line:84%
It was when I learned
about reincarnation

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:46.573 align:middle line:90%
that everything made sense.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:50.577 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, personally,
it's a foundational belief

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:51.811 align:middle line:90%
that really makes sense

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:55.849 align:middle line:84%
out of all those odd
loose ends of life.

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.717 align:middle line:84%
Those little tendencies
you have.

00:06:57.717 --> 00:07:00.387 align:middle line:90%
Those preferences.

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:01.855 align:middle line:90%
The things you're afraid of.

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:90%
The innate talents you have.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.391 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:05.692 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: And so many people--

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:07.827 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: The mole on
your neck or something.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.529 align:middle line:84%
You carry that through,
don't you?

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.264 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Well, birthmarks,

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
actually there are
physical carryovers.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
The birthmark, say, you have in
your body are often indication

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.074 align:middle line:84%
of wounds that you've suffered
in a previous lifetime.

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:22.108 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.109 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: I was doing
a reading for a guy

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.178 align:middle line:84%
and I did a past
life reading for him.

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.447 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yeah, you died from a--

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.683 align:middle line:84%
somebody stabbed
you in the head."

00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:31.851 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Oh my God, I've
got a birthmark there."

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.453 align:middle line:84%
And he showed it
to me right there.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.754 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:38.792 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And his daughter has
a birthmark front and back

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.093 align:middle line:90%
where a spear had gone through--

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:41.027 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh my God.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:42.062 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- in a previous
lifetime.

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:43.195 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there are
physical carryovers.

00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:44.197 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That is fascinating.

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:46.132 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.002 align:middle line:84%
As a psychic, as a medium,
do you try to answer

00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:51.638 align:middle line:84%
that age old question,
"How did this happen?

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?"

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.745 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is beyond
logic to assume

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:02.716 align:middle line:84%
that there's an intelligent
designer, which I believe in,

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:05.218 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation, which
I believe in,

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
various facets

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.724 align:middle line:84%
of the paranormal
or the supernatural.

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:14.928 align:middle line:84%
How have you recognize that
in your own personal life?

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:18.798 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure you think about
that almost everyday, you know,

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:21.101 align:middle line:84%
that there's too much
order in the universe,

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:23.335 align:middle line:90%
that this all seems to work.

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:25.472 align:middle line:90%
It fits like a glove.

00:08:25.472 --> 00:08:26.539 align:middle line:90%
But how?

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.308 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: That's what I see.

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:30.609 align:middle line:90%
I see a perfect system.

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:33.246 align:middle line:90%
But I see imperfect people that,

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:38.785 align:middle line:84%
because of what we
don't see, it's chaotic.

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:42.288 align:middle line:84%
I know that I've-- just
like everybody out there.

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:45.325 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've had unfortunate
painful experiences where--

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:46.359 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: We're human beings.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.427 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- you've had
falling out with--

00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:49.562 align:middle line:84%
falling out with
even best friends--

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.663 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.165 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- that have
been terribly painful.

00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:55.368 align:middle line:84%
But I know within myself, if I
really want to know something,

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.504 align:middle line:90%
spirit provides the information.

00:08:57.504 --> 00:09:00.573 align:middle line:84%
I had a falling out with a very
good friend of mind and it was--

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:04.377 align:middle line:84%
when a new person came into
our circle of friends--

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.712 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- this friend wanted
that person for themselves--

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.581 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.016 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- and I was kind of
pushed out of the picture.

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:12.352 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was in so
much pain and I wanted

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:13.486 align:middle line:90%
to know what that was all about.

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:15.789 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw was
a previous lifetime

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:18.758 align:middle line:90%
in which she and I were sisters.

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:22.528 align:middle line:84%
And in that lifetime, I
was the beautiful sister

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:24.397 align:middle line:84%
and she was more of
the plain sister.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.598 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:28.168 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And what happened
is we where at a function.

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
a ball or a dance,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.707 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that she was
interested in this guy.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:39.212 align:middle line:84%
And instead of letting her
have him, because I knew

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:43.783 align:middle line:84%
that I could get him, I got
him and kept him away from her.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:50.557 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that was
intentional to do something bad.

00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:53.193 align:middle line:90%
It was an intentional wrong.

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:54.494 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It got you, didn't it?

00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:56.963 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: It came back
exactly the same way

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:58.798 align:middle line:90%
with the same set of people.

00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:02.535 align:middle line:84%
And once I saw that and
once I caught a glimpse

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:06.172 align:middle line:84%
into why this bad
thing happened to me,

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I had set those
forces in motion and I was able

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.047 align:middle line:84%
to live with that at that point
in time, whereas before that,

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:84%
it was eating away at
me for months, years.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.186 align:middle line:84%
After I got that
insight, I'm cool with it.

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.055 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, you know
what they say about karma,

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:24.824 align:middle line:84%
what goes around comes
around, and I believe that.

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.059 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: It does come around.

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:30.497 align:middle line:84%
And so, karma actually
makes this a perfect system.

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:33.733 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
we will not--

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:34.901 align:middle line:90%
the earth might to be hit

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:84%
by a meteor one day
and cease to exist.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.903 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And it will.

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:38.605 align:middle line:90%
And it will.

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:40.006 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yeah, it will.

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:41.074 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Just a matter of time.

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.075 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yes.

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:45.678 align:middle line:84%
But that's part of
the plan as well.

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:46.778 align:middle line:90%
You have to have faith in it.

00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:49.916 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Who designed
this plan, Victor?

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:51.784 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Well, you believe
in a higher power.

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:52.352 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I do.

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:53.686 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: I do too.

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:56.456 align:middle line:84%
But I think that our
concept or understanding

00:10:56.456 --> 00:11:00.593 align:middle line:84%
of that higher power is
limited by what we are capable

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.929 align:middle line:84%
of comprehending
and understanding.

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:07.033 align:middle line:84%
But it-- so that higher
power I think is reflected

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.535 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:13.173 align:middle line:84%
Without consciousness,
there would be no awareness.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:17.343 align:middle line:84%
And so, I believe that
that which is in me looking

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:22.148 align:middle line:84%
at you is the same thing
that is in you looking at me.

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:25.018 align:middle line:84%
And that thing is
ageless and timeless.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.119 align:middle line:90%
So when you were a kid looking

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:28.588 align:middle line:84%
on the mirror seeing
that little boy.

00:11:28.588 --> 00:11:32.525 align:middle line:84%
That the same thing is in
the mirror looking at us now

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.395 align:middle line:84%
that we've aged but
it has not aged.

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.697 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people will--
you hear people say that.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.132 align:middle line:90%
You know, I feel the same.

00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:40.099 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.134 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: I don't feel
like I've aged.

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:42.602 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We're just in
a different shell.

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:43.603 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Exactly.

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:46.372 align:middle line:90%
And you will shed the shell.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:49.275 align:middle line:84%
I had a very powerful
experience in a meditation group

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:53.846 align:middle line:84%
that I was a member of for many
years and it was a pivotal group

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:57.483 align:middle line:84%
for my psychic and
spiritual growth.

00:11:57.483 --> 00:12:02.655 align:middle line:84%
I was standing there talking
to a friend in the group,

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:07.894 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden my
body dropped to the floor

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:11.364 align:middle line:84%
and it folded up almost like
one of those folding chairs.

00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:15.802 align:middle line:84%
But my light body was still
standing there talking

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:17.503 align:middle line:90%
to my friend.

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:20.607 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking
at my light body.

00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:23.209 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked down at my
body and I saw it down there

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:24.978 align:middle line:84%
and I saw people
moseying around.

00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:29.482 align:middle line:84%
We were kind of in a hallway,
a little off from the group.

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:33.052 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself, "I think
I'd better get back in that body

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:35.822 align:middle line:84%
or somebody will come
over and think that--

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:36.656 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You're dead.

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: -- something is wrong."

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.291 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:41.094 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: So I remember
moving back into my body

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:45.531 align:middle line:84%
and the chair unfolds and
I stand up right and, "Wow,

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:46.766 align:middle line:90%
that was interesting."

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.668 align:middle line:84%
It was an out-of-body
experience.

00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:51.804 align:middle line:84%
And that was very profound
'cause it was exactly what you

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:52.672 align:middle line:90%
just said.

00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:54.507 align:middle line:90%
You are not your body.

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.676 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You do marvelous work.

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:57.877 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Thank you.

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.245 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you have been
doing it for a long time.

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:02.882 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen you a couple times
at conferences and on panels

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:05.952 align:middle line:84%
that you're on where
people are just mesmerized

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.287 align:middle line:90%
about the things that you do.

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:10.957 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever come across
a situation, Victor,

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:16.429 align:middle line:84%
where you didn't want to be in
that situation, as a psychic,

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:21.334 align:middle line:84%
as a medium, where it was
uncomfortable for you?

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:22.735 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Sure.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:26.506 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I'm going to show you in a
general way when that comes up.

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:30.276 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to hear
the truth of ourselves.

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:31.477 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to.

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.746 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Nobody does,
unless it's all good stuff.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:34.981 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Exactly.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:39.519 align:middle line:84%
But we tend to do a
psychological mechanism that's

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:43.089 align:middle line:84%
in place in all of us called
the principle of projection.

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:47.060 align:middle line:84%
We tend to project the qualities
about ourselves that we do not

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.661 align:middle line:90%
like on to other people.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.064 align:middle line:90%
We disown those qualities.

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:55.301 align:middle line:84%
So the way to learn
about projection is

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:59.172 align:middle line:84%
to notice what you're critical
of, what you don't like.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.474 align:middle line:84%
Every time you see a
certain type of person,

00:14:01.474 --> 00:14:03.342 align:middle line:90%
what you think or say.

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:06.479 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who
is very flamboyant.

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:09.682 align:middle line:84%
And we were out one
night at a restaurant

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.584 align:middle line:84%
and he noticed somebody
on the other side

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:13.686 align:middle line:84%
of the room being
flamboyant and he said,

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:14.821 align:middle line:90%
"I can't stand that guy."

00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:16.456 align:middle line:90%
He's so flamboyant.

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:18.191 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Boisterous and all that.

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:18.858 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yes.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.226 align:middle line:90%
And we all laughed.

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:23.496 align:middle line:84%
We all snickered because we
all know he's flamboyant and--

00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:26.032 align:middle line:84%
but he had disowned that
part of himself, you know.

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:30.803 align:middle line:84%
So you could just observe
yourself and those things

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:32.805 align:middle line:84%
that you don't like
about other people.

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:36.943 align:middle line:84%
You can pretty much tell
that it's within you.

00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:38.878 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Maybe he was a
little more flamboyant

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:39.778 align:middle line:90%
and he was, I guess.

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:40.913 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't take it, huh?

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:42.982 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Well, yup,
that's probably--

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:45.818 align:middle line:84%
there's probably a
lot of truth to that.

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:51.624 align:middle line:84%
So, the tough parts of my work
are when somebody really wants

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:53.693 align:middle line:84%
to know what's going
on with them

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:84%
but they're not quite
ready to hear the truth.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.531 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And you tell
them the truth.

00:14:58.531 --> 00:14:59.799 align:middle line:90%
You don't hold back, do you?

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.334 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Well, I'll tell you.

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:02.735 align:middle line:90%
Being a psychic is a lot

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.138 align:middle line:84%
of being a psychologist
or being a counselor.

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:06.272 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: OK, so you
got to weigh that?

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:08.741 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Or being ministerial
and you've got

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:11.277 align:middle line:84%
to deliver information
in a palatable way

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:13.146 align:middle line:84%
with a spoonful sugar,
otherwise,

00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:15.381 align:middle line:84%
they will completely
discount you.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.117 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of clients where,
you know, if I make a prediction

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:21.788 align:middle line:84%
that "No, this relationship that
you're in will not work," they--

00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:23.189 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And don't want
to hear that, do they?

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:25.591 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: They don't want to
hear it and then they hate me.

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.893 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:15:26.893 --> 00:15:28.427 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And then later, you
know, it's because I'd made

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.663 align:middle line:84%
that prediction even though
the relationship failed two

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:31.364 align:middle line:90%
weeks later.

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:32.365 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:32.899 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: They blame
you for it, right?

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yeah.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.768 align:middle line:84%
So, we don't want to hear
what we don't want to hear.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.503 align:middle line:90%
But I do that too.

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.838 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:41.274 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: You know, we can't
really read ourselves very well

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:46.879 align:middle line:84%
if we have an emotional stake
in our expectations being played

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.714 align:middle line:90%
out the way we want them to.

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:52.318 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How much free choice do
we really have in our existence,

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:54.587 align:middle line:90%
or is it all predetermined?

00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:56.989 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: I think a lot
is predetermined.

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.792 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that we do
have some freewill choice.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.562 align:middle line:84%
So within a set of
parameters, we are capable

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:06.032 align:middle line:84%
of being the best
person that we can be.

00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:08.267 align:middle line:90%
One panacea that I've learned

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.336 align:middle line:84%
through this work
is self-acceptance.

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
If you want an easier life,
accept yourself exactly

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.678 align:middle line:90%
as you are now, warts and all.

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:19.779 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely.

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:23.516 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And if you can
fully embrace that,

00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:27.486 align:middle line:84%
then most of your
problems sort of disappear

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.755 align:middle line:84%
because you start
working with what you are

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:33.759 align:middle line:84%
and what you've got instead of
wishing you were someone else

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:36.528 align:middle line:84%
with these different set of
characteristics or talents.

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:38.965 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's
pretty important.

00:16:38.965 --> 00:16:42.768 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We hear so much
talk about soul mates.

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:47.373 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we see people at the
divorce rate of 50 percent

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:51.177 align:middle line:84%
or the relationship rate
at 50 percent saying,

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.446 align:middle line:84%
"This is my soul mate,"
and then they're gone.

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:55.815 align:middle line:90%
They're gone out of their lives.

00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:58.116 align:middle line:84%
One, can you have more
than one soul mate?

00:16:58.116 --> 00:16:59.518 align:middle line:90%
I think you can.

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:03.389 align:middle line:84%
But two, why do people-- why
are they so quick to jump

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.758 align:middle line:90%
to this soul mate concept?

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:08.461 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: We're living
at a fairytale world.

00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:11.264 align:middle line:84%
Look at the stories that kids
hear, they're fairytales.

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:13.699 align:middle line:90%
The prince finds the princess.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.534 align:middle line:84%
They kiss and live
happily ever after.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:16.702 align:middle line:90%
People buy into that.

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.037 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I'm still a frog.

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:19.372 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.941 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: But, those fairytales
never come through that way.

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:23.776 align:middle line:90%
It's never like that.

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:25.912 align:middle line:84%
You've got to work
on a relationship.

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:26.879 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.247 align:middle line:84%
You don't just have
one soul mate.

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:32.418 align:middle line:84%
So if you broke up with that
person, that doesn't mean that,

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle line:84%
you know, you have no
more chances for love.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
To me, the definition of
a soul mate is somebody

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.525 align:middle line:84%
that you've experienced
a previous lifetime with.

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:40.359 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:42.495 align:middle line:90%
And by the way, was that person

00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:46.032 align:middle line:84%
that you thought was the soul
mate that you break up with,

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:48.501 align:middle line:84%
were they indeed the soul
mate in the first place?

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:49.535 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.671 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: I'll tell
you what that looks

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:53.706 align:middle line:90%
like from my point of view.

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:59.111 align:middle line:84%
Love and karma are both
forces of attraction.

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.479 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:03.516 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: People may think that
they're in love with a soul mate

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:08.421 align:middle line:84%
but more likely it's karma
bringing two people together

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:84%
almost like magnets
to work something

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.125 align:middle line:90%
out from a previous lifetime.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.227 align:middle line:84%
That's often mistaken
for falling in love.

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:17.029 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that they
don't have the feelings

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.364 align:middle line:90%
of falling in love.

00:18:18.364 --> 00:18:20.232 align:middle line:84%
But after the karma
has been worked out,

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:23.369 align:middle line:84%
they can go their separate
ways or stay together.

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:25.237 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes there's a choice.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:28.407 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that you have
psychic energy and libido,

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:31.944 align:middle line:84%
I think, the soul needs
these experiences.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:35.581 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that-- there's a
lot of people that stay together

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:37.049 align:middle line:90%
but they have nothing in common,

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:38.884 align:middle line:84%
but they just don't
want to be alone.

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot more
value in following the flow

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:48.794 align:middle line:84%
of psychic energy in your
life in and out of situations.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:49.762 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I agree with that.

00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:50.463 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk a little bit--

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:51.631 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: You grow more.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- about your
work, Victor, as a medium.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.036 align:middle line:84%
And when people come to
you, do they want to know

00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:58.371 align:middle line:90%
about their dearly departed?

00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:00.506 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:03.542 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: All of those
experiences are very unique.

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:08.314 align:middle line:84%
But what's really lovely about
it is that there is so much love

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.583 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes comes
through from people

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:12.051 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
towards the living.

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:17.123 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people have
not spoken those final words

00:19:17.123 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:90%
of goodbye.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.958 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: No closure.

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.326 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: There hasn't
been closure.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:24.663 align:middle line:84%
And when there's a good
link with a dead person and,

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:28.367 align:middle line:84%
as a medium, my job is
to simply form the link

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:31.237 align:middle line:84%
with the departed person,
with the dead person.

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:35.474 align:middle line:84%
Once I've formed that link, I
just-- I mean, I go between.

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.675 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:38.944 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And so, what I
always tell my client is--

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.846 align:middle line:84%
you know, he's going
to have memories.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:41.981 align:middle line:84%
He or she is going
to have memories

00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:43.983 align:middle line:90%
that I know nothing about.

00:19:43.983 --> 00:19:45.317 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to give it the way

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:46.619 align:middle line:90%
that they're giving it to me.

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:48.187 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know,
they will light up.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.222 align:middle line:84%
They know what they're
talking about.

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:53.759 align:middle line:84%
And it does allow
closure to take place.

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.227 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when somebody
is alive,

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:58.631 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
especially for some man

00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:00.032 align:middle line:90%
to express their feelings.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.735 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're afraid just
tell somebody how much they mean

00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:03.869 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.938 align:middle line:84%
How much their kids mean
to them, for example.

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:12.144 align:middle line:84%
And it's very gratifying when
a son hears from his father

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:17.249 align:middle line:90%
in spirit that his son was--

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.518 align:middle line:84%
he didn't deserve a son
this fine and as good.

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:20.352 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Son, you're good.

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:90%
You'll be OK.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.455 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yeah.

00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:25.491 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And, you know, it can
be very, very emotional.

00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:27.927 align:middle line:90%
Also with children who've died.

00:20:27.927 --> 00:20:30.963 align:middle line:84%
I find that they
come through so well.

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:34.333 align:middle line:84%
I got a couple who
lost their data

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:37.069 align:middle line:84%
and she was a handicap
during her lifetime.

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.137 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:20:38.137 --> 00:20:39.004 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: The first time
she came through,

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
she was running,
she was playing.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.111 align:middle line:84%
They like to emphasize that
they're able-bodied now.

00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:45.811 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:46.512 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: You know, so--

00:20:46.512 --> 00:20:47.213 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: If they weren't.

00:20:47.213 --> 00:20:47.747 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: If they were not.

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.582 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Absolutely.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:51.917 align:middle line:84%
Or if they were in pain
while they were alive

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:90%
that they are no longer in pain.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.291 align:middle line:84%
And those messages come
through so wonderfully, clearly.

00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.128 align:middle line:84%
It's a priceless
experience for the living.

00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:06.665 align:middle line:84%
Now, I will give you
an example of something

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't go as planned.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.402 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were talking
about expectations.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.004 align:middle line:90%
I had a family come in.

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:15.708 align:middle line:84%
It was a mother, father
and their daughter.

00:21:15.708 --> 00:21:18.511 align:middle line:90%
Their son in college was sitting

00:21:18.511 --> 00:21:21.213 align:middle line:84%
on the front porch
of the frat house.

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:26.485 align:middle line:84%
The rail give away and he
fell back onto the sidewalk,

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:31.023 align:middle line:84%
hit his head on the sidewalk
and died instantaneously.

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:34.927 align:middle line:84%
Now, every year, they
find a medium to go to.

00:21:34.927 --> 00:21:38.164 align:middle line:84%
They are still in a state
of grief and sadness.

00:21:38.164 --> 00:21:39.532 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:42.201 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: They bring that grief
and sadness into the reading.

00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:46.705 align:middle line:84%
Their son who is a very
adventurous spirit and,

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:50.342 align:middle line:84%
in that time of life, wanting
to breakaway from the family

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:52.244 align:middle line:90%
and develop a life of his own.

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:53.779 align:middle line:84%
When I see him on
the other side,

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:56.048 align:middle line:84%
he's exploring the far
reaches of the universe.

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:57.883 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want to
be brought down into

00:21:57.883 --> 00:22:00.085 align:middle line:84%
that vibration of
grief and sadness.

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.721 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: So, you know, he
almost doesn't even want

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:03.789 align:middle line:90%
to come into the session.

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:06.859 align:middle line:84%
The first time, he
wouldn't come in.

00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:08.561 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, he's not
coming in this time.

00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:09.962 align:middle line:90%
Let's reschedule."

00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:13.566 align:middle line:84%
The second time, he did, but he
does not want to move into that

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:15.367 align:middle line:84%
because he's having
the time of his life.

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:17.303 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Yeah, and doesn't want
to be reminded of the pain,

00:22:17.303 --> 00:22:18.704 align:middle line:90%
I guess, or something.

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:21.073 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: He doesn't want to move
into that vibration of sadness.

00:22:21.073 --> 00:22:24.443 align:middle line:84%
They have a very difficult
time accepting the fact

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
that he isn't missing
them as in--

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.381 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right, right.

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:31.083 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- like the way
that they are missing him.

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.284 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:33.152 align:middle line:90%
They don't understand.

00:22:33.152 --> 00:22:35.221 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: They don't understand.

00:22:35.221 --> 00:22:39.558 align:middle line:84%
You know, almost 100 percent of
the time, after somebody dies,

00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:42.294 align:middle line:84%
whether they're an
atheist or whatever,

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:45.731 align:middle line:84%
their very first sensation is,
"Oh my God, I'm still alive.

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:46.832 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:48.167 align:middle line:90%
I made it."

00:22:48.167 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're thrilled, you
know, so-- because they know,

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.139 align:middle line:84%
they've experienced that
there's no doubt any longer

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:57.109 align:middle line:84%
that life continues after the
death of the physical body.

00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:59.511 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Do you ever get a
spirit that has passed on,

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:02.014 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate through
you, trying to get a message

00:23:02.014 --> 00:23:05.284 align:middle line:84%
to someone, and you
don know who they are?

00:23:05.284 --> 00:23:06.652 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:10.389 align:middle line:84%
You know, the family hasn't
even been to you yet, let's say.

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: That happens
during group interactions

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.930 align:middle line:84%
where I'm doing gallery
readings and, you know,

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:22.735 align:middle line:84%
somebody is coming through and
giving me a lot of information

00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:24.737 align:middle line:84%
about their personalities
and what they're like.

00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:27.539 align:middle line:84%
I may know the part of the
room where their person,

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.141 align:middle line:90%
their living person is.

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:31.911 align:middle line:84%
But I might think it's
one person and it ends

00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:35.948 align:middle line:84%
up being the person
sitting behind them.

00:23:35.948 --> 00:23:41.654 align:middle line:84%
Some spirits are very
outgoing and big personalities.

00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:42.755 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:45.691 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And some are very
shy to come through.

00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:49.194 align:middle line:84%
Just like all the various
personalities of living people,

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:50.562 align:middle line:90%
people will tend to be that way.

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:52.364 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's the same.

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:54.566 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: One thing that's
interesting, George though,

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:58.771 align:middle line:84%
after a time, they
have a second death.

00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:00.673 align:middle line:84%
From their astral
plane, for example,

00:24:00.673 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
they will leave their astral
body and move into the mental

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.745 align:middle line:84%
or into the higher
spiritual planes.

00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:10.149 align:middle line:84%
Usually, in that case, they
had no longer hold as much

00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:13.819 align:middle line:84%
of the personalities they
had when they were on earth.

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:16.955 align:middle line:84%
Usually they become
greatly ennobled.

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.091 align:middle line:90%
They're ennobled.

00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, somebody
that was shy and retiring

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
on earth might become very
princely and grand and large.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.969 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm going
to say something here.

00:24:29.969 --> 00:24:32.071 align:middle line:84%
I have the privilege
and the honor,

00:24:32.071 --> 00:24:35.708 align:middle line:84%
there was a wonderful psychic
medium named Christine [assumed

00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:39.111 align:middle line:84%
spelling] in Cincinnati who
died of cancer recently.

00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:42.881 align:middle line:84%
She invited me to come visit
her in the hospital and it just

00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:46.552 align:middle line:84%
so happened that that
day, when I got here,

00:24:46.552 --> 00:24:52.091 align:middle line:84%
she was in her last
breaths of life.

00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:55.527 align:middle line:84%
And I was there to
witness her last breath.

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:58.297 align:middle line:84%
And then about five
minutes later, you know,

00:24:58.297 --> 00:25:00.632 align:middle line:90%
she was pronounced dead.

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:03.268 align:middle line:84%
Five minutes later,
though, it took her spirit--

00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:08.207 align:middle line:84%
her spirit exited her body
and my eyes went up like this.

00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:12.144 align:middle line:84%
I saw her rise up
and become large.

00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:14.012 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: The ectoplasm, right?

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.314 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: This isn't ectoplasm.

00:25:15.314 --> 00:25:16.014 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It was not.

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:16.515 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: This is spirit.

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:17.282 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:18.784 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: And it became huge.

00:25:18.784 --> 00:25:21.387 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like, you know,
a hot air balloon just--

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:22.254 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- rising
up into the sky.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.761 align:middle line:84%
That is what is trying to be
contained in this physical body.

00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:30.429 align:middle line:90%
We're inside of that.

00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:33.098 align:middle line:84%
That can't possibly
be contained in this--

00:25:33.098 --> 00:25:33.899 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:35.267 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: -- tiny body of ours.

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:40.672 align:middle line:84%
You know, we can't help but
have some limitation during an

00:25:40.672 --> 00:25:42.207 align:middle line:90%
earthly life.

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:45.043 align:middle line:90%
But upon death, we are set free.

00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:49.181 align:middle line:84%
And Alan Ramsey [assumed
spelling], my meditation teacher

00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:52.785 align:middle line:90%
who I mentioned earlier to you.

00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:55.888 align:middle line:84%
He always said that
when you die,

00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:84%
it's like being set
free from prison.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:58.524 align:middle line:90%
You go home.

00:25:58.524 --> 00:25:59.191 align:middle line:90%
You're set free.

00:25:59.191 --> 00:25:59.691 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You're done.

00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:00.392 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: You're finished.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.362 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Just don't go back.

00:26:03.362 --> 00:26:04.863 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Well, you know what?

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:07.766 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing that I
think is a little bit insidious.

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of interpretations of
Eastern religions have been

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.305 align:middle line:90%
to renounce our earth life.

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.106 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes.

00:26:14.106 --> 00:26:15.174 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: And to not be into--

00:26:15.174 --> 00:26:15.841 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Like it doesn't
mean [inaudible].

00:26:15.841 --> 00:26:17.009 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Right.

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:19.378 align:middle line:84%
Oh, let's just, you know,
get by and then die.

00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:20.712 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:24.249 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: And I think that's a
very insidiously evil belief

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that has probably
been misinterpreted.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.489 align:middle line:90%
Our lives are a gift.

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:34.326 align:middle line:84%
I think that we should fully
embody our life experience,

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:37.229 align:middle line:84%
whatever it happens to be,
and live our lives fully.

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:38.464 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we should just--

00:26:38.464 --> 00:26:39.465 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: No.

00:26:39.465 --> 00:26:40.165 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- past the
time [inaudible]--

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:40.866 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I'm in no rush.

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:41.834 align:middle line:90%
No rush to get there.

00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:43.469 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- until we're
out of here.

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:45.571 align:middle line:84%
You'll be out of
here soon enough.

00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:48.974 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy your experience,
embrace it.

00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:51.777 align:middle line:84%
Cherish and love the
people in your life.

00:26:51.777 --> 00:26:53.712 align:middle line:90%
Cherish what you've got.

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:55.814 align:middle line:84%
You might have a
very simple job.

00:26:55.814 --> 00:26:59.017 align:middle line:84%
You may be a superstar,
but you might be a janitor.

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:90%
You might be, you know, somebody

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.724 align:middle line:84%
who is just a regular
person raising their family,

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:07.793 align:middle line:84%
but that's the gift
you were given.

00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:09.628 align:middle line:90%
If you embody it fully

00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:12.965 align:middle line:84%
and if you do the very
best job you possibly can,

00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:15.501 align:middle line:90%
you're fulfilling your destiny

00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and you are appreciating
the gift of that life.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.275 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Victor, again,
another fascinating job.

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:25.511 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
this for how long now?

00:27:25.511 --> 00:27:30.449 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: I went professional
in 1990, and so 23 years.

00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:31.917 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That is a long time.

00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:33.185 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:36.121 align:middle line:84%
And what has been for you
the most satisfying aspect

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.357 align:middle line:90%
of your work?

00:27:38.357 --> 00:27:43.395 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Well, I think
it is a wonderful gift.

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:44.863 align:middle line:90%
It's a spiritual path.

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:46.098 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's God-given, I think.

00:27:46.098 --> 00:27:49.001 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: It's a God-given
gift that we all have.

00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:50.602 align:middle line:84%
But if you aren't
interested in it,

00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:52.371 align:middle line:84%
why would you be
forced to do it, right?

00:27:52.371 --> 00:27:53.672 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:56.508 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: If you want to go be
an athlete or, you know--

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:57.876 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: An accountant
or whatever.

00:27:57.876 --> 00:28:00.412 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: -- electrician or
build houses, go do that.

00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:01.547 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:28:01.547 --> 00:28:03.815 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: But this is where
my soul interests are.

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.384 align:middle line:90%
You know, so I got the gift.

00:28:05.384 --> 00:28:06.285 align:middle line:90%
I developed it.

00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:07.352 align:middle line:90%
I learned it.

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.288 align:middle line:90%
It was a process of unfolding.

00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:12.824 align:middle line:84%
And it gives me a perspective
into life that I really enjoy

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:14.927 align:middle line:84%
that I think that a lot
of people don't get.

00:28:14.927 --> 00:28:16.562 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That's a great
perspective.

00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
What would you recommend
to people, Victor,

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:23.201 align:middle line:84%
who are having trouble
in this life

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:26.939 align:middle line:84%
because of their fears
of the afterlife?

00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:29.841 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell them?

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:35.147 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: Well, I had a client
here who-- very religious man.

00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:36.982 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I
think that he thought

00:28:36.982 --> 00:28:41.553 align:middle line:84%
of becoming a monk at some
early time in his life.

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:48.894 align:middle line:84%
I think that people
sometimes bypass real life

00:28:48.894 --> 00:28:50.596 align:middle line:90%
through a thinking process.

00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:52.464 align:middle line:84%
They think their
way through life.

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to play
by a certain set of rules

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.236 align:middle line:84%
and you lose a sense
of spontaneity and joy.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:00.839 align:middle line:90%
And when I told him that he's--

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:04.142 align:middle line:84%
there was an insidiousness
to his belief system

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:07.946 align:middle line:84%
that was keeping him from
truly loving and embracing,

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:10.916 align:middle line:84%
with all of his heart,
his children, his family,

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:13.118 align:middle line:84%
his life's experience,
it clicked for him.

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:16.421 align:middle line:84%
And he put that rule book,
that little set of rules

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:19.458 align:middle line:84%
that he was trying to live his
life by, put it on a backburner.

00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:84%
He started enjoying
life instead of being

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.796 align:middle line:90%
so afraid not to make a mistake.

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:25.697 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It made a big
difference, [inaudible].

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:26.465 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Yeah.

00:29:26.465 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:90%
It gave him his life back.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.668 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It sure did.

00:29:29.668 --> 00:29:33.372 align:middle line:84%
>> VP: You know, so I think
that it's all in your beliefs.

00:29:33.372 --> 00:29:34.439 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's got to be.

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.808 align:middle line:84%
Victor, people love
websites these days.

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:37.509 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: You can find me

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:44.483 align:middle line:84%
on victoryoflight.com
or victorparuta.com.

00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:46.918 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You know, the
other side is something

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:49.388 align:middle line:90%
that I am in no rush to get to.

00:29:49.388 --> 00:29:53.392 align:middle line:84%
But when I do, I think I'll
be prepared because of talking

00:29:53.392 --> 00:29:54.526 align:middle line:90%
to people like you, Victor.

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:56.361 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
on Beyond Belief.

00:29:56.361 --> 00:29:57.329 align:middle line:90%
>> VP: Thank you so much.

00:29:57.329 --> 00:29:58.463 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor.

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And thank you for
watching Beyond Belief.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:20.352 align:middle line:90%
