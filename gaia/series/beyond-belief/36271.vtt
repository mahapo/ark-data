I'm George Noory.

November 22, 1963, a day that,
literally, will live in infamy,

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:34.234 align:middle line:84%
a day that changed all
our lives here in America.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.974 align:middle line:84%
You'll excuse the fact that
I'm out of breath, but about 10

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
or 15 minutes ago,
a tragic thing --

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.112 align:middle line:84%
from all indications at
this point, has happened

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:46.146 align:middle line:90%
in the city of Dallas.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.016 align:middle line:84%
Let me quote to you
this, and I'll --

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:50.417 align:middle line:84%
you'll excuse me if

A bulletin -- this is from the
United Press  from Dallas.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.923 align:middle line:84%
"President Kennedy and Governor
John Connally have been cut

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:59.293 align:middle line:84%
down by assassins'
bullets in downtown Dallas.

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:00.727 align:middle line:84%
They were riding in
an open automobile

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.095 align:middle line:90%
when the shots were fired.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.565 align:middle line:84%
The president, his limp body
cradled in the arms of his wife,

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Jacqueline, has been rushed
to Parkland Hospital."

situation, Jerry.

A story with that -- just
we will never forget.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Jerome Corsi:
It changed America.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.008 align:middle line:84%
We went in a different
direction.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:20.881 align:middle line:84%
I think Jack Kennedy was going
to shut down the CIA, for sure.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And the
Federal Reserve.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Federal Reserve.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:25.452 align:middle line:84%
He knew that we didn't
need to have --

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.753 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve is not
part of the government.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:28.755 align:middle line:90%
It's private banks.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And Kennedy had
started printing treasury notes

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.061 align:middle line:84%
which we can print,
without having

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:35.896 align:middle line:90%
to pay interest for our money.

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy was not going
to fight lying CIA wars.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.871 align:middle line:84%
He did not send the military
into Cuba -- the Bay of Pigs.

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:48.241 align:middle line:84%
He was not going to fight
with the US military in Laos,

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:51.411 align:middle line:84%
and he was withdrawing
US military from Vietnam.

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:52.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He was hated
by a lot of people.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:53.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:55.082 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He was
either loved or hated.

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:58.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And he made very
powerful enemies who were,

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:00.554 align:middle line:84%
you know, viciously
angry at him.

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:02.589 align:middle line:84%
The Dulles' I put at
the top of the list --

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.858 align:middle line:90%
Allen Dulles and the CIA,

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:07.794 align:middle line:84%
especially after Dulles
had tricked Kennedy.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:11.965 align:middle line:84%
He thought that this Bay of
Pigs invasion was going to fail.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.736 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy will look bad, and he'll
send in a military strike --

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:18.405 align:middle line:84%
a naval air strike from
a carrier offshore.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:19.873 align:middle line:90%
Well, Kennedy wouldn't do it,

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.942 align:middle line:84%
because he realized the
CIA was tricking him.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
The CIA was supposed
to work for him.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.278 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy was not a warmonger.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.847 align:middle line:90%
He wanted out of Vietnam.

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:29.316 align:middle line:84%
He wanted -- he wanted
major change here.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Kennedy said
in his first inaugural

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that we would help any
nation fight for the freedom,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.189 align:middle line:90%
if they fought for themselves.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.526 align:middle line:84%
And in his analysis
of Laos and Vietnam --

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:42.095 align:middle line:84%
first of all, the people
were not universally behind

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:42.829 align:middle line:90%
this freedom...

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...move, and they
weren't going to fight the war.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.502 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, the
governments were corrupt,

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:51.138 align:middle line:84%
and Kennedy said how
are we ever going

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:53.640 align:middle line:84%
to win a war that
we won't fight?

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.375 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go win it for them.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to send U.S. --

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.146 align:middle line:84%
it's not in our national
security interest.

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:01.748 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy was really
a constitutionalist.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.718 align:middle line:84%
He understood, you
know, the requirements

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:06.787 align:middle line:84%
of the war being a
national security interest.

00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:09.656 align:middle line:84%
Very much like George Washington
in his farewell address.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Isn't it
interesting how Ho Chi Minh came

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.326 align:middle line:90%
to us first...

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:14.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: ...for assistance.

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:16.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Well and, in fact,

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:18.465 align:middle line:84%
the CIA blew some
major opportunities.

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:19.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They screwed
that up too.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Exactly.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.269 align:middle line:84%
You've got to remember, the CIA
was also running drugs out of --

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.039 align:middle line:90%
into China from Laos...

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: As they're
doing out of Africa.

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:30.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And these
lying CIA wars, you know,

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.812 align:middle line:90%
Lyndon Johnson was their man.

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:34.514 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Lyndon Johnson
had his own motives

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:37.017 align:middle line:90%
for wanting JFK killed,

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:84%
but Lyndon Johnson
happy Tonkin Gulf --

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.655 align:middle line:84%
used that incident
to fight Vietnam.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:42.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Which never happened.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Never happened.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the destroyer -- the
Maddox was an intelligence ship.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.763 align:middle line:84%
It was in the Gulf of Tonkin
spying on North Vietnam.

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:53.567 align:middle line:84%
Johnson didn't care, but Kennedy
would not use these pretext,

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and I say the assassination
was the beginning

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.738 align:middle line:90%
of this New World Order --

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:03.243 align:middle line:84%
the Dulles' and the Bush's
having support of the Nazis.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
when they decided

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:05.879 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to take over.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: And that the...

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It was a coup.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:11.284 align:middle line:84%
And that the banksters were
going to work with them,

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:14.855 align:middle line:84%
financing munitions
development with a state

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.991 align:middle line:84%
in a partnership
with the government.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.193 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What Eisenhower
warned when he left office.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He said military
invest for complex.

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:23.997 align:middle line:90%
He knew what was coming.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And Kennedy, when he said
he was not going to fight

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.335 align:middle line:90%
in Vietnam with U.S. troops...

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.102 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He was the road block.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.704 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: He drew a line.

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:33.707 align:middle line:84%
He was in the way of
the military that wanted

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:37.144 align:middle line:84%
to develop a new style
military fighting Gorilla wars.

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:38.612 align:middle line:90%
He held the Bell Helicopters

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that wanted single-source
contracts --

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.717 align:middle line:84%
no-bid, single-source contracts,
which we had never done

00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:45.352 align:middle line:90%
until Vietnam on weapon systems.

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.622 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Huge amounts of
money to be made in this,

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:52.125 align:middle line:84%
and the CIA running
drugs out of Vietnam,

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
which they were already
doing in 1963.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's talk
about the various groups

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:56.663 align:middle line:90%
that hated Kennedy, Jerry.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:57.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Right.

00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And individuals
in this country.

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:02.602 align:middle line:84%
And let's start with
Jimmy Hoffa...

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:03.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:04.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: ...who was one of
the last reporters to talk

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.873 align:middle line:90%
to him in Detroit in '75.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:07.641 align:middle line:90%
He hated Hoff.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:08.375 align:middle line:90%
He hated Kennedy.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.543 align:middle line:90%
Hated Kennedy.

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Absolutely
hated him, so there's one.

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:14.648 align:middle line:90%
Johnson also hated Kennedy.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:15.882 align:middle line:90%
See the Kennedy's were going

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:19.753 align:middle line:84%
to destroy Johnson's
career with  Life  magazine.

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:23.223 align:middle line:84%
The -- an issue was going to
appear right after Dallas.

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:25.826 align:middle line:84%
It'd be the second story
in the Bobby Baker scandal.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Now the Bobby
Baker scandal was going

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.296 align:middle line:90%
to destroy Johnson's career.

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:30.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Wipe him out.

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:33.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Because this was
an aid who Johnson promoted.

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.035 align:middle line:84%
They were running a prostitution
ring out of the Senate.

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:37.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And Johnson probably
knew what was going on.

00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:39.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Johnson was
at the center of it.

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:42.909 align:middle line:84%
They were running a vending
machine company with --

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.144 align:middle line:90%
for the mobs in Chicago.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Putting
it in military bases

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:49.282 align:middle line:84%
and other defense contractors,
making a fortune on it.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.184 align:middle line:84%
Johnson was at the
center of this,

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.286 align:middle line:90%
and it was going to be exposed.

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:56.856 align:middle line:84%
The Kennedy's wanted
Johnson off the ticket in '64

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.292 align:middle line:84%
and Johnson knew
he was targeted.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:02.495 align:middle line:84%
The only way he was going save
himself -- Johnson, his career,

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:04.297 align:middle line:90%
was if Jack Kennedy was killed.

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:07.334 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's in large
part, why three attempts

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:11.404 align:middle line:84%
to kill Kennedy were
made in November 1963.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:13.406 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the first
two didn't succeed.

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:14.941 align:middle line:84%
People don't know
much about them.

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:16.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: But I disclosed
them at length in the book.

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:18.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes you do.

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:19.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: There's
other research I...

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:20.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And it's very
well disclosed in the book.

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:21.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Right.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So we had
all those players.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And of
course the mob...

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: The mob.

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sam Giancana.

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little look
at this video first, Jerry.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.522 align:middle line:84%
>> But in Chicago, they
called it the outfit

00:06:30.522 --> 00:06:33.226 align:middle line:90%
and Sam Giancana was the boss.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.328 align:middle line:84%
The only name you
needed to know,

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:37.163 align:middle line:90%
and when Sam took the reins,

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
all hell broke lose
all over the world.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.269 align:middle line:84%
>> He was funny, he was
comical, he was witty.

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:44.404 align:middle line:84%
>> Said he was a little out
there, so to speak, crazy.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.539 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most
sensational stories

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.975 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
organized crime.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:50.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Al Capone trained
him to kill.

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:54.648 align:middle line:84%
With pals with Frank Sinatra
and lovers like Marilyn Monroe,

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:59.185 align:middle line:84%
pursued by the FBI, courted
for secret favors by the CIA,

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:03.089 align:middle line:84%
Sam was setting off the sparks
that changed the 20th Century.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:06.693 align:middle line:84%
Momo, Sam Giancana,
the sharp dressing guy

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:09.863 align:middle line:84%
who takes way too little
credit for way too much.

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:12.399 align:middle line:90%
Cross him once, wake up dead.

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Just ask Kennedy.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.674 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music] In '63, I
know when it had all happened.

00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:23.276 align:middle line:84%
He seemed, like,
you know, shocked.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:31.484 align:middle line:84%
>> First, as a personal
favorite to Joe Kennedy,

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.953 align:middle line:90%
Momo gets a president elected.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:41.961 align:middle line:84%
>> It's nice to have a
president in your back pocket.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:50.937 align:middle line:90%
>> Then Momo gets ripped off.

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:54.841 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us anything
about any your operations,

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:57.544 align:middle line:90%
or are you just going to, like,

00:07:57.544 --> 00:08:01.981 align:middle line:84%
giggle every time I
ask you a question?

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:05.218 align:middle line:84%
>> They claim that's because I
might believe my answer might

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:07.287 align:middle line:90%
can incriminate me.

00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:10.957 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought only little
girls giggled, Mr. Giancana.

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:11.658 align:middle line:90%
>> [Giggle].

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:12.492 align:middle line:90%
>> And then he gets mad.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Wow.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Well, it's true.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They went after him.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:18.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: They went
after, and see...

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why'd they
turn on him?

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:22.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: The back story is
with the whole Elkins family

00:08:22.234 --> 00:08:25.472 align:middle line:84%
and the start of the
Hoffa investigations,

00:08:25.472 --> 00:08:29.275 align:middle line:84%
the Kennedy's made a deal
with the western mobs,

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:33.613 align:middle line:84%
because the eastern mobs
were moving in on Vegas,

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.782 align:middle line:90%
on Reno, on the territory...

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: With teamsters' money.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And the protestants
were the western mob --

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:43.356 align:middle line:84%
the Elkins family, which
sided with Joe Kennedy,

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.391 align:middle line:90%
who had never been accepted

00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:46.292 align:middle line:84%
by the eastern mob
during bootlegging,

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:50.997 align:middle line:84%
because the Italians and the
Jews didn't accept the Irish.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Okay.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:56.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And so there was
a revenge grudge match.

00:08:56.803 --> 00:09:00.173 align:middle line:84%
The Joe and Bobby -- the father
and the son, were pursuing

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:01.508 align:middle line:90%
when Bobby was attorney general.

00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:05.879 align:middle line:84%
Now Jack really was not
as much a part of that.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:90%
Jack was sharing...

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He was the victim.

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:10.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And he was
also sharing girlfriends

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:11.484 align:middle line:90%
with the mob.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:12.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:12.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: With Giancana.

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:14.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:17.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He was going to towns
and partying with the mob.

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.759 align:middle line:84%
Jack Kennedy was not
on his vengeance match

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:20.827 align:middle line:84%
against the eastern
mob, but Bobby,

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:84%
who was the bulldog
of the family, was.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.999 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So Kennedy could
have stopped his brother?

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He could have
and he should have,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.401 align:middle line:84%
but the father was the one
pushing this ultimately,

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:29.702 align:middle line:84%
Joe Kennedy, and Giancana
finally got tired of it

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.071 align:middle line:84%
and sent Carlos Marcello --
remember in New Orleans...

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:31.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yep.

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:32.839 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:33.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...Bobby Kennedy
picked up Marcello...

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:34.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Jim Garrison
was on the trail.

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He was
and he was correct.

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
It dumped Marcello in
Guatemala and he was --

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.044 align:middle line:84%
Bobby Kennedy was
the most surprised

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:38.611 align:middle line:84%
in the world the see
Giancana walk out.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:39.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:40.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well, Giancana
from that day on was dead set

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:41.848 align:middle line:84%
that he was going
to kill Kennedy.

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:42.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So let's
assume this, Jerry.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Right.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:43.817 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They all got together.

00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:44.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Right.

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:45.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: At some
clandestine moment.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Right.

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:46.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: To do Kennedy in.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:47.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know,
the mob, the Dulles --

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.023 align:middle line:84%
all of them that hated -- Hoffa
may have been a part of it.

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:51.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: And the Cubans,

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:51.991 align:middle line:84%
who had been part of
this original CIA.

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:52.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The anti-Castro
Cubans.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Army --
trained armies.

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:54.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I think the
only one who wasn't

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:55.862 align:middle line:90%
in on it was Fidel Castro.

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:56.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well, I think
Fidel knew better.

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:57.664 align:middle line:84%
He knew that if he
participated that...

00:09:57.664 --> 00:09:58.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He was history.

00:09:58.798 --> 00:09:59.732 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: That would be
the end of Fidel Castro.

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So they
all get together

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.067 align:middle line:90%
and they plot this scheme.

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:02.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:02.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they have to
use the CIA sharp shooters...

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:03.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yeas.

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: ...

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.504 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:05.738 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:06.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well, and also
some of the CIA mercenaries.

00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:07.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Both.

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: They had...

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:08.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They had --
didn't the fly a guy

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:09.375 align:middle line:90%
in from France to do it?

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:11.411 align:middle line:90%
In fact, in one of the --

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.913 align:middle line:84%
it came out in the CIA
documents that were released.

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:84%
There was a Corsican
hitter -- assassin.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: No relation
to Jerry Corsi.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:20.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: No, no, not at all.

00:10:20.587 --> 00:10:21.554 align:middle line:90%
Different entirely.

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:22.589 align:middle line:90%
No part of the family.

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:25.258 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, these
-- this assassin --

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:28.394 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Sutro Emirates
-- he changed names,

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:31.998 align:middle line:84%
was part of the original team
that wanted to kill Dugall.

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you
go back to the day

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.001 align:middle line:90%
of the jackal, where he goes...

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:38.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well, the CIA
was running drugs with --

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:41.774 align:middle line:84%
out of Vietnam, and the French
connections through Corsica --

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.343 align:middle line:84%
that was the movie
French Connection .

00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:45.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That was it, the
French Connection , sure.

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:48.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And so
the mob involved

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:53.553 align:middle line:84%
with the CIA was also this
Corsican assassin, was in Dallas

00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:58.324 align:middle line:84%
that day -- arrested in
Dallas, November 23, 1963,

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.226 align:middle line:84%
and let go by the Immigration
and Naturalization...

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.394 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...Service
without an investigation.

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And he was a
sharp shooter, wasn't he?

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yeah.

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:06.499 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the
best, most noted,

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.068 align:middle line:84%
most notorious international
assassins.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Jerry, I've
said all my life,

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.738 align:middle line:90%
there are no coincidences.

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:12.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Right.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:13.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That things
happen for a reason.

00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:14.707 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:16.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What are the
odds of that happening?

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well, you
know, it's --

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:21.514 align:middle line:84%
all also the likely suspects are
usually involved, so you know,

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:24.183 align:middle line:84%
I name a number of the
assassins that were involved.

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.819 align:middle line:84%
E. Howard Hunt, I think, was
one of the operational guys,

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:29.422 align:middle line:90%
and this original plot --

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:32.825 align:middle line:84%
the CIA plot to have a coup
d'etat, which is what the...

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:33.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: This is what happened.

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:34.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: It was a coup d'etat.

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:38.264 align:middle line:84%
It was developed in
1956 in Guatemala.

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:42.035 align:middle line:84%
E. Howard Hunt trained an
army to invade Guatemala.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.269 align:middle line:90%
It was a CIA army.

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:46.472 align:middle line:84%
They deposed they had a
Guatemala banana company --

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:47.307 align:middle line:90%
United Fruit Company.

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:48.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And then they didn't
like the next head of state,

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.978 align:middle line:90%
so they said he was killed.

00:11:51.978 --> 00:11:54.781 align:middle line:84%
Nobody saw him be killed, but
one of his guards killed him.

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said the guard
turned the weapon on himself.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So the assassin's dead,
the pan lay is established.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Then they killed him.

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:02.855 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:05.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And that was the model
of a dead patsy in a CIA head

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:08.561 align:middle line:84%
of state assassination
that was a coup d'etat.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.663 align:middle line:84%
They just used the same
model over and over again.

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:11.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:12.498 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere over the line,

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:13.666 align:middle line:84%
somebody said we've got
this guy names Oswald.

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:14.801 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:15.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: We're going
to use him as the patsy.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:17.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And we're going to
do all these other things.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Well, Oswald.

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:20.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And it all fell
into place perfectly.

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:22.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And Oswald, as I
say, is an agent in showing...

00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:24.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, he
knew something.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:25.311 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:90%
In fact, Oswald knew Ruby.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:84%
They were -- went back in
connections in New Orleans,

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.053 align:middle line:84%
which was well established
in various of the bars.

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:35.622 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Oswald -- part

00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:38.358 align:middle line:84%
of Oswald's family was
part of Marcello's family.

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:42.128 align:middle line:84%
They knew each other --
Oswald knew Marcello as a kid.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:43.129 align:middle line:90%
Oswald was in the...

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Bizarre.

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He was in the
New Orleans, you know,

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Civil Air Patrol
with David Ferry.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well what was his...

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:52.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Who is the pilot

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:55.274 align:middle line:84%
who flew Marcello
back out of Guatemala.

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What was the
fair play for Cuba?

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.778 align:middle line:90%
That was...

00:12:58.778 --> 00:12:59.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Fair play for Cuba,
I think, was part of the set

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:04.384 align:middle line:84%
up to portray Lee Harvey
Oswald as a Maoist,

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
Maoist organization.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Okay.

00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:10.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And there's a
lot of behind the scenes...

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: We had film
of him holding up...

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:12.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:13.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: ...leaflets.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: He was..

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They had
everything ready.

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He was the only
member of the, you know,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.366 align:middle line:84%
this "Free Play for Cuba" in
New Orleans, but the group --

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of Oswald
was to create this identify

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.873 align:middle line:90%
of him as a communist.

00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:28.241 align:middle line:84%
They've got part of
his cover story...

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:29.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:30.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: ...as a double agent.

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:30.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
what they wanted.

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: That's
what they wanted.

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:32.912 align:middle line:84%
It was part of his defect
to the Soviet Union.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:33.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He hated America.

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:35.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well it
would always --

00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes and the
documents we have now,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.951 align:middle line:90%
he's working with the FBI.

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:42.722 align:middle line:84%
He's working with the CIA, so
as an agent they could have said

00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:44.724 align:middle line:90%
to him, you go to the lunchroom

00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:47.627 align:middle line:84%
in the text schoolbook
depository and stay there,

00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:48.995 align:middle line:90%
and it was sometime later

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.264 align:middle line:84%
when Oswald realized
things weren't going

00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:52.532 align:middle line:90%
like he thought they were.

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:56.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Has anybody
utilized the latest technology

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:59.305 align:middle line:90%
in truth voice recognition?

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:00.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes, they have.

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:01.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And did
the patsy line?

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:03.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: The recognition
software shows

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:05.545 align:middle line:84%
that Oswald is telling
the truth.

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
That he was saying
he was not a...

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What a great story.

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: That he was
telling the truth.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.252 align:middle line:84%
And Oswald said, you know,
for instance the rifle,

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:16.322 align:middle line:84%
because all of these -- three
wallets were found for --

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:17.457 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't have
three wallets.

00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:19.859 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any --
he had three wallets...

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:20.993 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:22.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...found at
the assassination scene.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.596 align:middle line:90%
One he was carrying.

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:25.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's like the passport
of one of the 9/11 hijackers.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:26.566 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: And it...

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:27.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Pristine.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:27.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: And all the...

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Explain that.

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:31.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...identification,
the A. Hidell identification,

00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:33.806 align:middle line:84%
which with is marked this
Carcano rifle was bought.

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:34.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:35.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well that
could have been bought

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:90%
in Lee Harvey Oswald's name.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.412 align:middle line:90%
He said he didn't own a rifle.

00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:41.247 align:middle line:90%
He said he didn't shoot anyone.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:45.118 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the tests on Oswald's
hands did not show he had shot

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:46.185 align:middle line:90%
a weapon.

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:47.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What about
that picture of him

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.254 align:middle line:90%
with a rifle with the shadow.

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:49.088 align:middle line:90%
Was that like a...

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:50.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Oswald...

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: We didn't have
Photoshop, but it sure looked

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:52.759 align:middle line:84%
like somebody cropped
his head on a body.

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:54.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And Oswald said
that in the interrogation.

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:58.331 align:middle line:84%
He said that I will prove
that that is my head

00:14:58.331 --> 00:14:59.732 align:middle line:90%
on somebody else's body.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: It doesn't even --
I'll show you how that was done

00:15:02.602 --> 00:15:03.736 align:middle line:90%
when I get enough time.

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:04.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Oswald was
saying, at my trial...

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He didn't
get enough time.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He didn't
get enough time.

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:13.079 align:middle line:84%
At his trial, Oswald was going
to explain his background.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.781 align:middle line:84%
Tell about his connections
with the CIA.

00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:17.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Oh, he was
going to say everything.

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:18.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Everything.

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:21.354 align:middle line:84%
And so that's -- when the mob
realizes this and the CIA,

00:15:21.354 --> 00:15:23.523 align:middle line:84%
Dulles, Johnson --
the whole works,

00:15:23.523 --> 00:15:25.091 align:middle line:90%
two things have to happen.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.126 align:middle line:84%
One is Oswald's got
to be killed.

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:28.461 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He's got
to be shut up.

00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.763 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And Jack Ruby, mob
connections, running guns...

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:34.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...to Cuba out of New
Orleans, he's the one to do it.

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:36.035 align:middle line:90%
He's Jack Rubenstein from the...

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now they knew
that he'd be arrested.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.038 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: ...mob he trusted.

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:41.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So he knew this
was a one-way road, right?

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:45.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: In fact, see
there's two problems with Ruby.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:48.447 align:middle line:84%
One is he was developing
cancer, so his perspective

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.249 align:middle line:84%
of life wasn't that
great anyway.

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:51.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What about the rumor

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.785 align:middle line:84%
that we injected
him with cancer?

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well, I don't
know that that's the case

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.389 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
that Ruby faced --

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.558 align:middle line:84%
that he'd end up on
a meat hook somewhere

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:00.426 align:middle line:84%
if he had been given
the assignment

00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:01.894 align:middle line:90%
to kill Oswald and refused it.

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:03.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: One of your
protege's out there,

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:05.565 align:middle line:90%
the late Dorothy Kilgallen...

00:16:05.565 --> 00:16:06.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:07.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: ...interviewed Ruby.

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:08.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Never had a chance
to report on what she did.

00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:12.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And Dorothy
Kilgallen said, as you know,

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:17.109 align:middle line:84%
said that she had information
that would blow the entire cover

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.411 align:middle line:90%
up the Kennedy's had...

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:19.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And then she died.

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:20.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: She died.

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:21.981 align:middle line:90%
She was killed mysteriously.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:22.915 align:middle line:90%
Under suspicious circumstances.

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:23.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Under suspicious
-- yeah.

00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:25.518 align:middle line:84%
They think it was
a OD something.

00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:26.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Precisely.

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:29.355 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
cover up aspects

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:31.757 align:middle line:84%
of the Warren Commission
started immediately.

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:34.727 align:middle line:84%
And we've got, you know,
the mental of Nicholas deB.

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.996 align:middle line:84%
Katzenbach, who was the
assistant attorney general

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.866 align:middle line:84%
under Hoover, and he writes
Johnson and says we've got

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:42.235 align:middle line:84%
to convene this committee
and the committee's got

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:44.903 align:middle line:84%
to blame Lee Harvey Oswald,
because we don't want...

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:46.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or we'll toast.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.241 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Yeah, they'll
investigate us or the KGB.

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:52.144 align:middle line:84%
We don't want a war,
so the whole scare was

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:56.115 align:middle line:84%
if you don't go along, this
could be World War III.

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:59.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why is it that
the Kennedy documents...

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:17:00.385 --> 00:17:02.121 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: ...by the
government have been suppressed

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.257 align:middle line:90%
for 50 years, at least.

00:17:04.257 --> 00:17:05.591 align:middle line:90%
Right? We're coming up on that.

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: This is one of the
most important points that I

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:09.961 align:middle line:84%
in the book -- you
know, it's not just

00:17:09.961 --> 00:17:12.731 align:middle line:84%
who really killed Kennedy,
it's how we've become today.

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: We are still today,
fighting lying CIA wars.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.272 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when Saddam was saying
he didn't have any weapons

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:22.675 align:middle line:84%
of mass destruction, who's
surprised, you know, or Syria,

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:24.677 align:middle line:84%
it's Assad who's got
the chemical attacks.

00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
Well, John Kerry said to
the secretary of state,

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.614 align:middle line:84%
I've got a CIA report,
but you can't see it.

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:30.816 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Saddam should have
said I'm not going to get rid

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.418 align:middle line:90%
of the dollar for Petro...

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:33.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Precisely.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: ...and
he'd still be there.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And I think
he would still be there.

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:39.225 align:middle line:84%
You know, but again,
to go after the Saudis,

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:43.696 align:middle line:84%
to go after the banking
cartels, these are now you're --

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:45.531 align:middle line:84%
now you're signing
your death sentence.

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:46.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:49.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Even going back to
the first Gulf War, you know,

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.636 align:middle line:84%
the national security
interests --

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:53.005 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, that's when
George H. W. Bush comes out

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:56.676 align:middle line:84%
and says New World Order
in a congressional address,

00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:58.811 align:middle line:84%
and the real interest
in Saudi Arabia.

00:17:58.811 --> 00:17:59.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Saudi Arabian oil.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.347 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And Iran.

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:02.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: And Iran.

00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:03.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:04.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Now the documents
that are suppressed today,

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.687 align:middle line:84%
50 years after the
event, what is the CIA

00:18:07.687 --> 00:18:09.355 align:middle line:90%
and the government hiding?

00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:10.189 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we...

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why can't we see it?

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.826 align:middle line:84%
If it's just about Lee
Harvey Oswald, who cares.

00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:16.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: If Lee Harvey Oswald
really committed this crime,

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:19.031 align:middle line:84%
and those documents should
verify it, what are we hiding?

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:20.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: We're hiding a
cover up that's continuing.

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:22.969 align:middle line:90%
We're hiding the fact

00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:25.171 align:middle line:84%
that Kennedy would
have destroyed the CIA.

00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
The CIA has morphed
into the NSA.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:84%
This is an intelligence
gustafo Hitler would have loved

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.781 align:middle line:84%
to have had, combined
with a CIA fighting wars

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.216 align:middle line:84%
where Hitler could
have had the munitions.

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:40.987 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ending up with
Germany heading the EU

00:18:40.987 --> 00:18:43.789 align:middle line:84%
and us doing a transatlantic
partnership.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.458 align:middle line:90%
If you gave Hitler this bargain,

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:46.926 align:middle line:84%
he would have accepted
it easily.

00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:49.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are you concerned
at all about your own safety?

00:18:49.662 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well you
know, George, I mean...

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You're stepping on
some interesting toes, Jerry.

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:55.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And George I'm
an investigative reporter.

00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:56.802 align:middle line:90%
It comes with the territory.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:00.973 align:middle line:84%
If I start worrying -- I think
the best protection I have

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.376 align:middle line:90%
for myself is to be public.

00:19:03.376 --> 00:19:07.613 align:middle line:84%
Is to let everyone know what I'm
researching and to have it --

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:10.549 align:middle line:84%
I mean your show has been
tremendous in the ability

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:12.618 align:middle line:84%
to get the word out
-- or the message out.

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:13.819 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing like being on...

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.154 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They must
cringe when we're together.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:15.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: ...

00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:16.922 align:middle line:90%
Coast to Coast A.M.

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:18.624 align:middle line:84%
. And, you know, the
audiences are huge.

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:84%
The word you're getting
out and the ability

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.462 align:middle line:90%
to write these books,  WND

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:26.465 align:middle line:84%
and the support I've
had from Joseph Farah.

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:84%
The ability to get
the truth out.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.269 align:middle line:90%
To really uncover.

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:32.038 align:middle line:84%
And people say well,
Corsi's supposed

00:19:32.038 --> 00:19:33.672 align:middle line:90%
to be this far right-winged guy.

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:37.643 align:middle line:84%
What's he doing attacking the
CIA and supporting John Kennedy?

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.311 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Constitutionalist.

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:40.646 align:middle line:90%
I believe I'm not --

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:42.615 align:middle line:84%
I've attacked George
W. Bush equally...

00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:43.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes you have.

00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:44.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: ...in this book...

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes you have.

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:47.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...as being part
of this New World Order.

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:48.654 align:middle line:90%
We don't need a New World Order.

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:50.322 align:middle line:90%
We got a fine world order.

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:52.024 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Constitution.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:55.061 align:middle line:84%
Founding fathers set
up individual freedom.

00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:56.729 align:middle line:90%
And Jack Kennedy -- think

00:19:56.729 --> 00:19:58.097 align:middle line:84%
of how different the
world would have been.

00:19:58.097 --> 00:19:59.265 align:middle line:90%
We would not have had a CIA.

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:02.068 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have had
a Federal Reserve.

00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:04.236 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't have fought Vietnam.

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:06.172 align:middle line:84%
We'd have saved all
the radicalization

00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:07.339 align:middle line:90%
of a whole generation of youth.

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:08.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: We'd be
on Mars by now,

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:09.842 align:middle line:90%
because he was a space buff.

00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:11.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And he
wanted to pursue space.

00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
He knew the value of
scientific achievement.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.348 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy would fight wars,

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:18.718 align:middle line:84%
but only in our national
security interest,

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:22.321 align:middle line:84%
and he knew the CIA
was the main block.

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:25.291 align:middle line:84%
In other words, look
at that whole situation

00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:26.425 align:middle line:90%
with the Bay of Pigs.

00:20:26.425 --> 00:20:29.195 align:middle line:84%
Finally, that and the
Cuban Missile Crisis,

00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:31.831 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy starts communicating
directly with Khrushchev.

00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:32.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:35.434 align:middle line:84%
He had his own problems,
as you say.

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:36.635 align:middle line:90%
He was a womanizer.

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.871 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I think he
was a drug addict,

00:20:38.871 --> 00:20:39.972 align:middle line:90%
because of his pain, you know.

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:41.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well, Kennedy
was, you know...

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:43.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He would
inject himself in the leg.

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Yes, he would
be in a meeting with you

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.313 align:middle line:84%
and he would take a needle
from his Dr. Feel Good and...

00:20:47.313 --> 00:20:48.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Pop it right through.

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...he puts
it through his pants...

00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:50.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Dr. Feel Good.

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:50.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: ...and inject himself.

00:20:50.883 --> 00:20:51.917 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy had a lot of problems.

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I always said Kennedy
was a playboy.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
He was a goof off, but he
had a remarkable quality.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
You could be watching
Kennedy and he could be --

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.796 align:middle line:84%
his mind could be gone,
he'd kind of look off

00:21:03.796 --> 00:21:05.297 align:middle line:84%
into the distance
and he'd get it.

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:06.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: When he came back,
the questions he asked --

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.436 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy was a brilliant man.

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:11.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:15.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He had the ability to
intuitively sort through things,

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:18.077 align:middle line:90%
and a remarkable ability, even,

00:21:18.077 --> 00:21:20.012 align:middle line:84%
to come off of these goof
off periods of times...

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:21.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He would have
been in his nineties today.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:22.948 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yeah.

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:23.649 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy was the kind of guy
who would never read a book

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:90%
in a class and get an A.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:26.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: You know.

00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:27.486 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He was a C
student, wasn't he?

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:30.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He -- basically, a C
student, because he didn't care.

00:21:30.156 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy wanted to be a writer.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:33.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: That's what
he really wanted to be.

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:34.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, and
he had daddy's money

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.729 align:middle line:90%
so he knew that he was okay.

00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:39.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And daddy's money
permitted him to be a playboy.

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:41.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And he was --
he had enormous charisma,

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:44.737 align:middle line:84%
enormously attractive, he
always had women after him.

00:21:44.737 --> 00:21:45.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:48.174 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: It was
tough to resist.

00:21:48.174 --> 00:21:49.575 align:middle line:90%
No person is perfect.

00:21:49.575 --> 00:21:50.976 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I don't think
he wanted to get married.

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.678 align:middle line:84%
I think he was told
he had to get married.

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:53.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well, it
was part of the...

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Part of the plan.

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:56.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Part of the promotion
of other political career.

00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And, you know, the
marriage had many difficulties

00:22:00.286 --> 00:22:03.155 align:middle line:84%
to it, which were not
known at the time.

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, Jack Kennedy
had a deep concern and love

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.461 align:middle line:90%
for the United States.

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:13.899 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally, he was a patriot,
and he was not going to go along

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:17.636 align:middle line:84%
with the banks, Federal
Reserve, or the CIA.

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
He really was going through
a great personal peril,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.709 align:middle line:84%
and he was told that these
plots were there to kill him.

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:25.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He stepped on
the wrong toes, Jerry.

00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And he knew
that it was inevitable.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.816 align:middle line:84%
Jack Kennedy, I think, had
always this pull we love,

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:33.886 align:middle line:84%
this rendezvous with
death, he had a premonition

00:22:33.886 --> 00:22:37.723 align:middle line:84%
that he was not going to live to
be old, and if he ended up old,

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
in a wheelchair, you know,
crippled Addison's disease,

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.995 align:middle line:90%
congenital back ailments,

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:45.798 align:middle line:84%
he didn't really want
to be incapacitated.

00:22:45.798 --> 00:22:47.933 align:middle line:84%
He would rather have
lived a vital life

00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:51.804 align:middle line:84%
and pursued what he knew he
had to do, even at great risk,

00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:53.339 align:middle line:90%
and that's how he lived.

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:57.243 align:middle line:84%
The courage it took the day --
and the Bay of Pigs is going on,

00:22:57.243 --> 00:22:59.411 align:middle line:84%
and you know that
you're going to be blamed

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:00.946 align:middle line:84%
for these guys being
killed on the beach.

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:02.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That he had
nothing to do with.

00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:03.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: And you say...

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It was a setup.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.818 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...I'm
not going to go --

00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to authorize the
air strike, it stands down.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:10.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And he comes
forward to the public

00:23:10.356 --> 00:23:11.957 align:middle line:90%
and said I screwed up.

00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:12.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I screwed up.

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:14.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: My mistake.

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:15.261 align:middle line:90%
That takes great courage.

00:23:15.261 --> 00:23:16.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:17.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Most presidents
are not capable...

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:18.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And his
popularity went up.

00:23:18.631 --> 00:23:21.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Soared,
because he told the truth.

00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:26.171 align:middle line:84%
And when he investigated Laos
and he said I'm not going

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:84%
to fight for the Pathet
Lao, because first of all,

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.243 align:middle line:84%
this doesn't really
represent the people,

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:34.313 align:middle line:84%
it's not a popular movement,
and the government's corrupt.

00:23:34.313 --> 00:23:35.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Absolutely.

00:23:35.514 --> 00:23:37.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: You know, and
also the CIA killed Diem,

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:38.851 align:middle line:90%
and I go into this too.

00:23:38.851 --> 00:23:40.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, and that
shocked Kennedy, didn't it?

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:42.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Totally -- that
happened also November '63.

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:43.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I think he
realized he's out of control.

00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:45.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: That day
he realized...

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:46.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: He doesn't
have control.

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:48.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...the CIA's rogue
and is gunning for him.

00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:49.161 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:50.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: And he realized

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
at this point it was
going to get him.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:55.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Now the operational
plot, once it was made --

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:57.303 align:middle line:84%
decisions were made
at a top level.

00:23:57.303 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Allen Dulles, CIA, mob
figures at the top.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.542 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got the
operatives taking over

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.744 align:middle line:84%
and E. Howard Hunt
in his death bed.

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:90%
George, you were the first to...

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.081 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Brought his son on.

00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:11.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And to publicized
E. Howard Hunt's...

00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:12.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And his confession.

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:14.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: His confession.

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.789 align:middle line:84%
Make it national, E. Howard
Hunt said I was a benchwarmer.

00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:20.059 align:middle line:84%
I played a role, and he
named names in the CIA,

00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:24.363 align:middle line:84%
including Cord Meyer, whose
wife Jack Kennedy was having an

00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:27.366 align:middle line:84%
affair with, as being
one of the plotters.

00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:30.235 align:middle line:84%
And the operatives,
E. Howard Hunt,

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:34.373 align:middle line:84%
together with Johnny
Roselli, could pick the team

00:24:34.373 --> 00:24:36.642 align:middle line:84%
and the teams were
professional assassins.

00:24:36.642 --> 00:24:40.112 align:middle line:84%
People like -- well, I mentioned
and discussed Roscoe White.

00:24:40.112 --> 00:24:41.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, let's
-- as a matter of fact,

00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:43.082 align:middle line:90%
let's take a look at a video...

00:24:43.082 --> 00:24:43.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Sure.

00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: ...about Roscoe White.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.519 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that people
may have been too hasty

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:50.122 align:middle line:84%
in writing off the
Roscoe White story.

00:24:50.122 --> 00:24:53.025 align:middle line:84%
There are parts of it
which I think may be true.

00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:56.228 align:middle line:84%
While there's no solid evidence
linking Roscoe to the deaths

00:24:56.228 --> 00:25:00.366 align:middle line:84%
of Kennedy and Tippit, I think
he may have played some role --

00:25:00.366 --> 00:25:02.368 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a minor one,
in the conspiracy,

00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:05.137 align:middle line:84%
which resulted in
Kennedy's death.

00:25:05.137 --> 00:25:06.972 align:middle line:84%
I believe Roscoe
White was placed

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:09.641 align:middle line:84%
on the Dallas Police
Force to help frame Oswald

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:11.643 align:middle line:90%
for the assassination.

00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:12.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What do you
think of that theory?

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:14.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: I agree.

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:17.616 align:middle line:84%
And I also think that he was one
of the shooters -- Roscoe White.

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:20.119 align:middle line:90%
You can see in the Hughes film,

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:24.656 align:middle line:84%
a picture of Roscoe White
behind the picket fence

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:25.758 align:middle line:90%
by the rail yard...

00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:26.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: ...in his
police uniform.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.995 align:middle line:84%
Not wearing a hat,
not carrying a gun.

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:30.829 align:middle line:90%
He was a recruit.

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:31.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: But he's just there.

00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:35.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: He's just
there, and Beverly Oliver,

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:38.036 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the dancers
at the Carousel Club --

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:42.374 align:middle line:84%
the babushka lady, you
can see her standing there

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:45.177 align:middle line:84%
in the assassination
on the curb.

00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:50.883 align:middle line:84%
She went up to the grassy knoll
and recognized Roscoe White,

00:25:50.883 --> 00:25:53.786 align:middle line:84%
because Roscoe White's
wife was also a dancer

00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:56.288 align:middle line:84%
in the Carousel Club
with Jack Kennedy,

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:59.024 align:middle line:84%
and she said this
is Roscoe White.

00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:02.694 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked -- you
know, the pictures are there

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:05.831 align:middle line:90%
with this Honest Joe's truck.

00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:90%
You can see it in the Nix film.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.503 align:middle line:84%
Now the -- all the strange
things, when Forest Sorrels,

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:16.275 align:middle line:84%
who is the head of the
Secret Service in Dallas,

00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:19.278 align:middle line:84%
had his first chance
to talk to Ruby,

00:26:19.278 --> 00:26:23.482 align:middle line:84%
he says what was the Honest
Joe's truck doing there?

00:26:23.482 --> 00:26:26.585 align:middle line:84%
And Ruby talks about
the Honest Joe truck.

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:29.955 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was associated
with Roscoe White.

00:26:29.955 --> 00:26:31.457 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where
he kept his uniform.

00:26:31.457 --> 00:26:33.492 align:middle line:84%
I think he was one
of the shooters.

00:26:33.492 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I the other shooters -- I
talk about this Rose Cheramie.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.467 align:middle line:84%
This woman who was being
driven from New Orleans

00:26:41.467 --> 00:26:43.202 align:middle line:90%
by a group of the shooters.

00:26:43.202 --> 00:26:44.903 align:middle line:90%
One of them was a Cuban.

00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:46.305 align:middle line:90%
This guy, a KEO.

00:26:46.305 --> 00:26:47.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How many shooters do
you think they had out there?

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:49.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: I think, George
-- I think there were...

00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:50.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: At least three.

00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:54.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: At least three, but
I think they were in teams.

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:55.113 align:middle line:90%
In other words, I think...

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:57.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, one was
probably on a radio.

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: Yes.

00:26:58.417 --> 00:26:59.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they probably
all shot at the same time.

00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:00.419 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: But let's
say you had --

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.323 align:middle line:84%
let's say there were
nine shots in sequence,

00:27:04.323 --> 00:27:06.191 align:middle line:90%
so one shot three people shoot.

00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:07.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: The second
shot, three people shoot.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.963 align:middle line:90%
Third shot, three people shoot.

00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:12.798 align:middle line:84%
The people were shooting
in those --

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:15.133 align:middle line:84%
in other words, along
the grassy knoll,

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:18.003 align:middle line:84%
they could have positioned
different shooters

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:20.606 align:middle line:84%
with a particular shot
they were going to take.

00:27:20.606 --> 00:27:23.876 align:middle line:84%
So the second round, this guy
shoots, and the third round

00:27:23.876 --> 00:27:25.477 align:middle line:90%
of shooting, this guy shoots.

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:28.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And a lot of
people said that they saw

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:30.916 align:middle line:84%
or smelled gunfire
from the front.

00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:34.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: That's right,
and also the ballistics.

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:36.889 align:middle line:84%
That back wound to
Kennedy did not penetrate.

00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:38.924 align:middle line:84%
It went only a quarter
of an inch in.

00:27:38.924 --> 00:27:40.959 align:middle line:84%
The throat wound was
a puncture wound.

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:41.927 align:middle line:90%
It didn't exist.

00:27:41.927 --> 00:27:42.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Would that
have killed him?

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:44.329 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: No, probably not.

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:46.899 align:middle line:90%
Those were almost like 22 shots.

00:27:46.899 --> 00:27:50.802 align:middle line:84%
Down the road, the shots
that blew his head apart were

00:27:50.802 --> 00:27:52.037 align:middle line:90%
like exploder bullets.

00:27:52.037 --> 00:27:53.405 align:middle line:90%
The head bursts apart.

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:54.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exploded.

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:57.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Well a shooter does
not change ballistics during the

00:27:57.276 --> 00:27:58.644 align:middle line:90%
course of a shot.

00:27:58.644 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't suddenly start
shooting with exploder..

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:03.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: ...rounds.

00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:04.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:05.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: Unless the
guy's positioned ahead.

00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:06.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They had that.

00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:09.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: And they knew
that was the kill zone.

00:28:09.321 --> 00:28:10.889 align:middle line:90%
The kill shot was planned,

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:13.258 align:middle line:84%
not for the Texas
School Book Depository,

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:17.496 align:middle line:84%
which is a back shot, at a very
strange angle, in a low window

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:18.730 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't open very far.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.566 align:middle line:90%
You're kind of crouched down.

00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:22.334 align:middle line:90%
It's a horrible shot.

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But up front where
they've got to go

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.639 align:middle line:84%
through the triple underpass,
you're at the closest point

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:30.642 align:middle line:84%
to the car, and it's
declining --

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:33.478 align:middle line:84%
the road's declining at a three
degree angle, it's an S turn,

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:35.914 align:middle line:90%
but you can scope out one shot

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:38.717 align:middle line:84%
that you know you've got
the angle locked in for.

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:43.055 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point, the
shooter could have taken a shot.

00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:45.958 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You know, Jerry we
don't have the official answer,

00:28:45.958 --> 00:28:49.561 align:middle line:84%
I think, with stories like
who really killed Kennedy.

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:50.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: We have
the real answer.

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:52.731 align:middle line:90%
I think, we're there.

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.967 align:middle line:84%
I think we now understand
the assassination.

00:28:54.967 --> 00:28:57.269 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a coup d'etat.

00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:58.971 align:middle line:90%
I, like Ruby said, planted

00:28:58.971 --> 00:29:01.073 align:middle line:84%
at the highest levels
of government.

00:29:01.073 --> 00:29:02.441 align:middle line:90%
We know the guilt parties.

00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.543 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get the rest
of the documentation.

00:29:04.543 --> 00:29:05.611 align:middle line:90%
Let's finish the job.

00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:07.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And the big thing is.

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:10.616 align:middle line:84%
Those kinds of people are
still out there in control.

00:29:10.616 --> 00:29:11.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Corsi: And they --

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:15.587 align:middle line:84%
where we're living today
is this New World Order,

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:18.557 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve in
charge, the huge debt,

00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:21.193 align:middle line:84%
the lying CIA wars
in the Middle East,

00:29:21.193 --> 00:29:25.497 align:middle line:84%
weapons of mass destruction that
aren't found, Gulf of Tonkin,

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:28.166 align:middle line:84%
you know, what Eisenhower
warned us about.

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, Jerry you
keep doing what you're doing

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:30.736 align:middle line:90%
my friend.

00:29:30.736 --> 00:29:31.436 align:middle line:84%
>> Corsi: George,
thank you very much.

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:32.204 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Jerry Corsi.

00:29:32.204 --> 00:29:33.338 align:middle line:90%
Who really killed Kennedy?

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:37.275 align:middle line:84%
You've heard it hear
on  Beyond Belief .

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:54.259 align:middle line:90%
