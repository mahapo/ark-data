[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.998 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:10.648 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.175 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.260 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:25.932 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:10%
She is a shaman.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:10%
She is a high priestess.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:10%
But she wasn't always that.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:10%
There's a reason.

Deborah King, our special
guest on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Deborah, always a pleasure.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.711 align:middle line:90%
>> DEBORAH KING: Great, George.

00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
weren't born a shaman.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
You weren't born
a high priestess.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:90%
How did you develop into that?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, it
was back in my 20s.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I was a fast-charging
young lawyer, just

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.195 align:middle line:90%
a year out of law school.

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:10%
And the next thing I knew,
George, I woke up with cancer.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.505 align:middle line:10%
>>KING: Yeah, I know.

00:00:58.505 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:10%
It was a big shock.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:10%
I thought I was
perfectly healthy.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:10%
And I got off my life
for just a moment.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.430 align:middle line:10%
I stepped off of the treadmill.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:10%
And I looked back at myself,
and I was like, oh my God.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:90%
No wonder I'm sick.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a lot
of things wrong.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.052 align:middle line:84%
I was dealing with
some addictions

00:01:15.052 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to think about.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I had an addiction to alcohol,
I was addicted to Valium.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I
did was work on that.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that age?

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.961 align:middle line:90%
That was a young age, my God.

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:26.502 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I was just 25.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And I went to a 12 step program.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I worked with my doctors.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I asked for a little bit of
time to consider alternatives.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:90%
They gave me some time.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:90%
I learned how to meditate.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:90%
That was a big step.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing I did, I started

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:90%
looking at alternative medicine.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:90%
And I was really surprised.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
After just a few treatments
from an energy practitioner,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I had an amazing
remission from cancer.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you do conventional
treatment at all too?

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.492 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I didn't.

00:01:56.492 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty gusty.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I wasn't against it.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, but I was given a window.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.342 align:middle line:90%
My doctors gave me a window.

00:02:02.342 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend to
people that they

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
work with their whole team--
with their oncologists,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.762 align:middle line:84%
their physician,
their acupuncturist.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Get everybody on board.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that
window was, look,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to
do conventional now.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.597 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to do
chemo or radiation yet.

00:02:17.597 --> 00:02:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I was slow-moving.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:90%
I had six months.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so in
those six months,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:90%
you changed your life around.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I did.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And you can imagine my reaction.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in remission,
I wanted to know

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:84%
what made the cancer come,
what made the cancer leave,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
how to reproduce this
for other people.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And even more important,
what started the whole thing,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:84%
how to avoid it in
the first place?

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So during this
process, you beat this cancer.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:90%
You then became a shaman.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
You got involved in
spiritual things.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
You began to investigate
possessions, near death

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.567 align:middle line:90%
How did that evolution occur?

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, it's
one step at a time.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't eat the elephant
all at once, just one bite.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually working
with priests for a while.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I was very attracted to
light-filled experiences.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And hanging around
priests a lot,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I started to see a
lot of the dark, too.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So I realized it's
all one thing.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.639 align:middle line:90%
And we have to deal with both.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about the priests?

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Did they see that too?

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Did they see the darkness?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, they do, they do.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what
culture you go to, George,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
it's all the same--
east, west, north, south.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Every culture has a
shaman or a priest,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:90%
someone who's trained in this.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the dark
side responsible for some

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:84%
of the ills that we face--
the cancer, for example?

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Absolutely.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:90%
There is darkness.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We're kidding ourselves
if we pretend there isn't.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Culturally, we all know that.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
movies about the dark.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're attracted
to books and films that

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.769 align:middle line:90%
address it, because it's there.

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Deborah, what was
that first major step for you,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
then, where you started
getting involved in this?

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
through some of the work

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that you do to fight off
some of these evil spirits.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:90%
How did you start doing that?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.816 align:middle line:84%
Did you meet specific people
who pulled you along the way?

00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I did.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I did, and I was
working with a shaman.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
At one point, out of the
blue I developed a really bad

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:90%
back injury.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was flat on my
back for two weeks.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't figure it out.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.207 align:middle line:84%
I visited an acupuncturist
and an osteopath.

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was trying everything.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.915 align:middle line:84%
And they all said,
well, we don't

00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
see anything physically
wrong with you.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So this was at a period
where I was really

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:84%
trying to bring the
light to others.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the dark was
ready to challenge me.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah, they were
right there, weren't they?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: They were.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
And I was asleep one night.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up in the
middle of the night,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and I just knew up there
in the corner of the room,

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:90%
there was a dark force.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:90%
And it taunted me.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:84%
It shook the bed, and it
hollered at me all night.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:90%
It was just terrifying.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.014 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for several nights.

00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:07.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:90%
How did you sleep?

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, I didn't,
and I was exhausted.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
They wear you down,
and wear you down.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:90%
And so finally, I got smart.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I called a friend,
and I asked them

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to go to the nearest
church and pick up

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:90%
a crucifix and some holy water.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And that next
night, I was ready.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You pulled these out?

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.073 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I did.

00:05:30.073 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:90%
And I just aimed.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can use
whatever icon works

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
for you, whatever your
belief system might be.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And it pulled it back.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.147 align:middle line:84%
It's never been
that severe since.

00:05:40.147 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, when
you held the cross up,

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
did you have to say,
in the name of God?

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I did, I did.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, in the name of the--

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
an exorcist would do.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Exactly.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.186 align:middle line:84%
And see, I'd had already
had some experience by then

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:54.077 align:middle line:84%
with priests, and I'd
seen some of this.

00:05:54.077 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Now did this demon, whatever
it was, did it scream?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Did it holler?

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.684 align:middle line:90%
Or did it just like--

00:06:00.684 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It dissipated.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It floated away?

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.744 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It floated away.

00:06:04.744 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never to come back?

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, I've had a lot
of experience with clients

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and students, of course,
who have their darkness.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I can sense
it when it comes.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And the modality I
choose to eradicate it

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:90%
is different in each case.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I have to feel into the person
and also into their belief

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So for one person, I might
be using a Hindu deity.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And for someone else, I might
be using a Buddhist deity.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:90%
It's whatever works for them.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Deborah,
you are constantly

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of these,
what I would call,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
demons or evil spirits--
bombarded by them.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
How do you fight that off
so you don't get sick,

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.269 align:middle line:90%
like Edgar Casey did?

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, you try
to stay in the light.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I try to do the same things
that I urge my followers to do--

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to constantly be clearing
themselves, to be addressing

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
our own feelings of,
hey, it's our jealousy

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and our inadequacies that pull
us down and make us vulnerable.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constant-- it's
like warfare a little bit.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have documented
a lot of these cases, too,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:84%
in your books, and the
things that you've worked.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Here's one of your latest,
"Entangled in the Darkness:

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Seeking the Light."

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:84%
It's so important that
people seek the light

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:90%
and try to fight this.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
When people come to you,
what do they ask for?

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:90%
What is their issue?

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: It varies
from person to person.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:90%
It's just fascinating.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, what they
tell you isn't really

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:90%
what the issue is.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.121 align:middle line:84%
In fact, about half the
time, I've noticed that.

00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:38.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got to
find it out on your own?

00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, you
have to discern it.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with tens
of thousands of people,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and so I can discern pretty
quickly what the real issue is.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Some people are ready to step
up to a new platform of light.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like a vibration, George,
you can sense it in your body.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So I just feel, am I
going down into some sort

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
of shamanic thing, or am I
going up toward the light?

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I know what
the person's ready for.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In some cases,
some people probably

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:90%
are truly possessed.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:90%
There's evil around them.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
In other cases, maybe
it's a medical issue,

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:90%
or a mental issue, too.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:84%
When you're with them and
all of a sudden you realize,

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
well, this person may need
some psychiatric help.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's a possession.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:84%
How do you kind of
wiggle out of that?

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Delicately,
very delicately.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you a story.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.604 align:middle line:84%
I was working with a large
group here not long ago.

00:08:27.604 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, a women
in the back of the room

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:84%
was waving her arm in the air
and was pretty aggressive.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to be next, and so
people brought her up on stage.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
tell the audience

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:84%
all about the spiritual
experiences she

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.450 align:middle line:84%
was having--
visions and whatnot.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.135 align:middle line:84%
And I could really
sense schizophrenia.

00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, wow, whoa.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Not the possession that
she thought she had.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.456 align:middle line:90%
It was all-- it was very sad.

00:08:56.456 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it is said,
because they believe it.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh yeah.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And her husband was with her.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And he looked very
uncomfortable.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.155 align:middle line:84%
And I dealt very
delicately with it,

00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and tactfully, and
ushered her out.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:90%
And I asked to see her later.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And I took her in a
back room, and I really

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
urged her to think
about medication.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And she told me she had just
left a mental institution that

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:90%
was next door.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.775 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: And it just-- yeah.

00:09:22.775 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:90%
And so I--

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.322 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You pinpointed
that one perfectly.

00:09:27.322 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I guess you have to
be careful like that.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But the true
possessions now, have

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:84%
you come across
cases that have just

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.760 align:middle line:84%
scared the living
daylights out of you?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Several times, I've
wished I could run.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:90%
One time, I actually did run.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I was too
tired to cope with it.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a really interesting
case about a year ago,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
where a woman called
from a foreign country

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.455 align:middle line:84%
and demanded to be seen, and
flew in on a private jet.

00:09:55.455 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:90%
It was all very impressive.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah I kind
of got sucked into it.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that took me
out of alignment.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
I can't work properly
if I'm in my ego.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And oh, this was
all very impressive.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I violated a couple
of my own rules.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You knew.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:10.371 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I saw it coming.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I worked at night, which
is not good for me.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that
this gal arrived,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I could sense this huge
demonic possession.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:90%
It was very frightening.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I got sick after that one,
because I wasn't in alignment.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:90%
I got kind of nauseous once.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing an individual
on the Coast-to-Coast radio

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
show, and I started
getting messages

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:84%
from listeners who were
saying, I don't feel good.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.544 align:middle line:84%
This person, there's
something wrong.

00:10:39.544 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Something's happening.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was supposed to be
the representative of what

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
was called the Maitreya,
that a lot of people

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:90%
thought was the Antichrist.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And the more he-- he seemed
like a nice person, older guy--

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
but the more he
talked, the more you

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:84%
felt like you were being
pulled in into something

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:90%
that just wasn't quite right.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And the audience sensed it.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Deborah, I've never been sick
on the air, ever in my life.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't how long I
could do that show.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I was getting
nauseous and sweaty.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended the interview,
went to a commercial, came back

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:90%
and he was gone.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I felt fine.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.727 align:middle line:90%
It just went away.

00:11:19.727 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah, and
see, your own body's

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful-- it's like a kit.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:84%
It just gives us all
of these symptoms.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.210 align:middle line:90%
It tells us.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:84%
We all instinctively know
when we're around dark stuff.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I don't like it.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't like it.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:90%
You've looked at possessions.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:90%
What is this that does it to us?

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what are these entities?

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:10%
>>KING: You know, there is
kind of mild forms, lots

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:10%
of times there are thought
forms that someone's died,

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:10%
and just a thought
form has remained.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.804 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's the
whole individual

00:11:56.804 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't passed
on to the next realm.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:90%
They're still here.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:90%
We call those ghosts.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's a fallen angel.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:84%
That's someone who
never lived, but it's

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:84%
a spirit that decided
to go from the light

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
to the dark, kind of the
Lucifer sort of story.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So there are a large variety
of types of dark energy

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that are floating
around out there.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we get open to it, when
we have holes in our own energy

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.045 align:middle line:84%
field-- which we're
sitting inside of--

00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The find it.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.461 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:25.402 align:middle line:90%
They scoop right in.

00:12:25.402 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's
like a disease.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like cancer, where if
your immune system is down

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:90%
for whatever reason, it hits.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.799 align:middle line:84%
And I would guess these
demons are the same thing.

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Absolutely.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.131 align:middle line:84%
And you know what-- you know
how the medical system tells us,

00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:41.717 align:middle line:84%
well, we all have cancer cells
in our body all the time.

00:12:41.717 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:84%
There's darkness
around us all the time.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many
different ways to combat it.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.605 align:middle line:90%
So I don't want to scare people.

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can an individual
do it on their own?

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: To a
degree, to a degree.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of small
steps you can take.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel that you're
seriously being chased

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:84%
or harassed by dark
forces, I would really

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.230 align:middle line:90%
urge people to get some help.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You go through various
rituals, too, to fight off

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.770 align:middle line:90%
and ward off evil spirits.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
You've brought some
things here for us today.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's go through some of them.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.756 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Oh, yeah, one
of the best things

00:13:15.756 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:84%
that people can do at home
is take a sea salt bath.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a really easy thing to do.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.085 align:middle line:84%
You take a pound of sea
salt, a couple of these--

00:13:22.085 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.449 align:middle line:90%
Just good old sea salt?

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Baking soda, hop in.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.042 align:middle line:84%
Not too hot, you don't
want to cook yourself.

00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
deplete yourself.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is a great
way to clear yourself

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:90%
of lower-level dark energies.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why does that work?

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.964 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: It works the same
way that the ocean works.

00:13:38.964 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle line:84%
You know if you swim, you know
that great feeling you have

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:90%
when you get out of the ocean?

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's invigorating.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Oh, you feel
so fresh and clean.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is the same.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Works the same as
sunlight, so it actually

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:84%
changes energy,
transmutes energy.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.594 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you just
dump in how much?

00:13:54.594 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: That's the
perfect amount.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The whole thing?

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yep, the whole thing.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I would use two of these.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:90%
All together?

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.201 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:14:01.201 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:90%
And then just go to bed.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
You wake up feeling fresh
and clean the next morning.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you
might be dealing

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.598 align:middle line:84%
with something a
little bit darker.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And beyond this then,
what else do we have here?

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, if you're
worried about dark forces

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
in your space, one of the
best things you can use

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:26.459 align:middle line:90%
actually is a little of this.

00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:90%
So this would be a great thing.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.429 align:middle line:90%
So this is--

00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know if
you can see that or not.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: This is Epsom salts.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:90%
I've heard a lot about that.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.121 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:35.750 align:middle line:90%
So here's how Epsom salts works.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.180 align:middle line:90%
You burn it.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:84%
You add a little bit alcohol,
the highest proof you can get,

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:90%
and then you light it.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:42.880 align:middle line:90%
We won't do that today.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it flares up.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: It creates a gas in
the room, and it clears-- now,

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.900 align:middle line:90%
this is an old chef's trick.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Every chef in a big
restaurant knows this trick

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:90%
to clear his kitchen.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
It just clears all
the energy out.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Now, be super careful.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I lit the curtains on
fire one time doing this.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I guess the flame
could be pretty high, right?

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.788 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Whoosh, away it goes.

00:15:05.788 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:90%
So you would do a whole room.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
You just carry this
around very carefully.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:84%
You get the oven mitts
out, and you have a helper.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And you just do the
whole room like this.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:90%
You can do people.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Just be very careful,
don't get too close.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:90%
It gets very hot.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.340 align:middle line:84%
You want to have something
that can't catch fire.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Plain old Epsom salts.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:24.825 align:middle line:90%
You pick it up at a drugstore.

00:15:24.825 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: That's right.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The highest profile
alcohol you can get.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if it
doesn't work, you

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:90%
could always drink the vodka.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: That's right, step two.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:84%
All right, what else
do we have here?

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.302 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, then another
trick, of course, again

00:15:38.302 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:84%
you could spray the whole
room with holy water.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you have to
go to a church to get that?

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, I
bless my own now.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And with a lot of intentionality
and some training,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.969 align:middle line:90%
you can learn to bless your own.

00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:90%
And do you have to say anything?

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Is there a ritual behind it?

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: You don't just
use your own words.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
You intend for this to be
a carrier of the light,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:90%
to work with the light.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Whatever works for you
and your belief system.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And if for some reason the
spirits do not leave you,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.332 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, I would
get a shaman or a priest

00:16:13.332 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:90%
to help me out at that point.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like you.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Uh huh, yeah.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.614 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does
the rituals normally take?

00:16:19.614 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: They don't
take very long.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.946 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think that's
an individual thing.

00:16:22.946 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I notice mine are very fast,
less than a couple of minutes.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that's because the
spirit works through you

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and your unique personality
and your idiosyncrasies.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very type A, and
I couldn't wait an hour.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.412 align:middle line:90%
So mine are very fast.

00:16:37.412 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I'd
want it done ASAP too.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.995 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: That's right.

00:16:39.995 --> 00:16:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why wait?

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.372 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: That's right.

00:16:42.372 --> 00:16:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they after?

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.625 align:middle line:90%
Do they want our souls?

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to do?

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Oh, that is
such a great question.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:90%
So here's how it really works.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:84%
The light and the dark
are actually all the same.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be on a whole
nother plane to sense that.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And here on Earth,
we don't sense it.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:90%
We see duality.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
We see light, dark, black,
white, winter, summer.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Everything seems like duality.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But on this plane where spirit
lives, it's all the same.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.339 align:middle line:84%
So the dark is actually trying
to merge with the light.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, in doing
so it gets confused,

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and it tries to take me out
and you out along the way.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to
secure your light.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it really wants.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can work with
it, and make it happen easily.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have
to beat it to death.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you put
your guard down,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
if-- let's say-- you get
intoxicated or you're on drugs,

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
do you open yourself up for
possession a little better?

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Addictions disempower us.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
We're giving our personal
power over to a substance,

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:90%
or a practice, or an activity.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
It could be anything--
pornography, shopping,

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.250 align:middle line:90%
it can be anything.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.250 align:middle line:84%
We literally give our
personal power to that.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.734 align:middle line:84%
And so that makes us
really open to dark forces.

00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got to
change that, too, then.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Our own behavior, we're
actually in the driver's seat.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:90%
We just think we're subject.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, we're in the
driver's seat the whole time.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you come across
a case where even you thought,

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.940 align:middle line:90%
I need some help here?

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.222 align:middle line:84%
This is bigger than
I can even handle.

00:18:25.222 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, yeah.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
The story I told you a
minute ago, where I got sick?

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:90%
I went back and I saw a priest.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've had to seek
priests a number of times,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.714 align:middle line:90%
where I've gotten--

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For yourself.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah, of course.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no, you can get banged up.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.014 align:middle line:90%
A lot of my teachers died young.

00:18:42.014 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
was going to say.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.282 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you afraid
something could happen?

00:18:45.282 --> 00:18:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, I am.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm careful.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever
bring these home with you?

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh yes.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:90%
And you have to clear yourself.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't feel
I've cleared myself,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll go see someone
and get some help.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I would
guess the spirit world,

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:84%
the evil spirit world,
doesn't like people like you.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.275 align:middle line:84%
Because they know you're
out to get rid of them.

00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: That's right.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:84%
They sense it as
being gotten rid of.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what
I'm trying to do

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.770 align:middle line:84%
is accomplish what
their deeper longing is,

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:84%
which is to merge
with the light.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to go
to the higher vibration.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:90%
It feels good.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:90%
We love it.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
We hear that great
symphony of sound,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.697 align:middle line:90%
and we're all happy there.

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
seen a metamorphosis

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:84%
with somebody who came in to
you full of possession, full

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.392 align:middle line:84%
of evil, and then walked out the
door like a brand new person?

00:19:36.392 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, many times.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I had a student just not that
long ago who, out of the blue,

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:84%
started moaning and shrieking
and throwing her head around

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:90%
like Rosemary's baby.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's when
I'd say, time to go.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.881 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: And she was
in the front row.

00:19:52.881 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it was the last
day of a long workshop.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
pausing and thinking,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
am I too tired to
deal with this?

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided she
was so much in the light

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that this must be something
that I should handle.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.120 align:middle line:90%
She had a partial possession.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It was fascinating.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:90%
It was an ancient dragon energy.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.030 align:middle line:90%
It was very dark.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But at one time, it
had been very light.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So our cultures, we move
through periods of-- and so

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:84%
this light had become dark,
and it had to be eradicated.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And now she's one of the
biggest teachers I have.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:90%
She's amazing.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever been attacked

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:84%
during one of these
sessions, physically?

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I have.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.006 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:20:32.006 --> 00:20:33.506 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
get out of that?

00:20:33.506 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: You run.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever go
toe to toe with them?

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: No, but I have run.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:90%
I have run a couple times.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.174 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, they
just, what do they do.?

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
They just, ahh, and
come at you like that?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah, come at you.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see the energy.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:84%
You'll see a lot of red and
know that you're at risk.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I was actually more
concerned, probably,

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
the day I was working
with the woman

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
from the mental institution
from next door that

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:90%
had schizophrenia.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She could
have attacked.

00:20:58.895 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: That felt pretty risky.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you there with the
any security, or any helpers

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.802 align:middle line:84%
who can jump in to
help you at any time?

00:21:05.802 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Or are you there by yourself?

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: That's a great question.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
People in my field usually
have a retinue of helpers,

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and I don't.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I work solo.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure how smart that is.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got to be
careful of that, exactly.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I know various
events I go to, I've

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
always got one or
two people there,

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:90%
because you just you never know.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.986 align:middle line:84%
99% percent of them
are well-intentioned.

00:21:26.986 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah, and
then there's that 1%.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you've got
that one, that's right,

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:84%
that you just can't
figure it out.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I was at an event a couple years
ago prior to the Mayan calendar

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:42.160 align:middle line:84%
date, and this guy looked
like he had a sword in a cane.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was approaching
the panel, really upset,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
claiming that none
of the panelists

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
understood what the
Mayans were all about.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the director of the
panel, and I'm saying, hey,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
we'll get your
question in a second.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Calm down.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But he kept getting
closer and closer.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was holding this
thing with his hand on it.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And you thought it was like a
samurai sword all of a sudden.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a
couple people who

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:84%
were in the audience
who were there.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to call them
security, but they kind of like

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:84%
got there next to the
guy, close enough so

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that if he tried to do
that, they'd get him.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So I guess you have
to be careful too.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.737 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I do.

00:22:22.737 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
recommendation would you

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
give to people about
fighting these evil spirits?

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we'll call them.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: My first
recommendation would be,

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:84%
see how clear you
can keep yourself.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:90%
How do we stay clear?

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:90%
We eat the right foods.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.292 align:middle line:84%
We get enough sleep--
that's actually a big one.

00:22:39.292 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:90%
People are so sleep-deprived.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sleep?

00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:42.259 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Being sleep-deprived
is not a good thing.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.830 align:middle line:84%
It really opens us
up to other forces.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.301 align:middle line:84%
I recommend some
sunshine, some fresh air.

00:22:50.301 --> 00:22:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It sounds simple, but
these are the things

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:90%
that actually keep us safe.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:84%
The main thing we have to
do is be constantly dealing

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:84%
with our own dark emotions--
our jealousy, our resentments.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
We need to not disown
them, but instead own them.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Write down.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Admit.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:10%
Wow, that sister-in-law
of mine drives me crazy,

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.470 align:middle line:10%
or whatever it is.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:10%
And just be at peace with how
you really feel about things.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the safest
things you can do.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Deborah, how
do people find you?

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.730 align:middle line:10%
Website?

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.479 align:middle line:10%
>>KING: My website,
deborahkingcenter.com.

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:10%
And I've listed the
protective measures there

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:10%
for your viewers.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:90%

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:31.011 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:23:31.011 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope I'm never
in need of her services,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:90%
where I'm possessed.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But gosh, if it ever happens,
at least I know she's out there.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.568 align:middle line:84%

"Beyond Belief."
