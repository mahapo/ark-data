00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.898 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:10.668 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.559 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory-- and thanks
for bringing us into your homes

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
or on your tablets,
wherever you may

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:10%
be watching this
program right now.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:10%
With my special guest,
Mr. Aerospace, himself,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:10%
Robert Zubrin.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:10%
He's an engineer.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:84%
He's written a book called
"The Case for Mars."

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:10%
And did you know that
there are actually

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:10%
human beings who would love
to go to Mars, who would love

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:10%
to spend years on the surface
of Mars, and that some of them

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:10%
are actually training
for that mission one day?

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:10%
That's a great program, Robert.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:10%
There's a couple of
groups out there doing it.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.300 align:middle line:10%
You're with the Mars Society.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:10%
What's up?

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, the Mars Society
has been doing Mars mission

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:10%
simulations in both the American
Desert and the Canadian Arctic.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:10%
We have Mars analog
research stations

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.802 align:middle line:10%
at both of those locations.

00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:10%
Most of these missions have
been just two weeks long.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:10%
A number have been
one month long.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.180 align:middle line:10%
And right now,
we're raising funds

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:10%
to do what we call Mars Arctic
365 which would be a one year

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.590 align:middle line:10%
human mission simulation
in the high arctic--

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: On Devon Island.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many people?

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.083 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Six.

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:35.094 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Six people living
together for one year.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:10%
Living together, but not just
living together-- exploring.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:10%
Devon Island--
it's a polar desert

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:10%
with a meteor crater in it.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:10%
It has created Mars geology.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:10%
We would have a team up there
conducting a sustained program

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:10%
of field exploration,
operating under the same kind

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:10%
of constraints they would
face as if they were on Mars.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Space suits?

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: That's right.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:10%
They can't go outside
without wearing space suits.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:10%
So they've got to do their field
work under those difficulties.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:10%
Then they gotta do their own
lab work in the hab, operating

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:10%
in a kind of telescience
collaboration

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:10%
with our remote science
team in the United States.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:10%
They gotta tend to the
repair of equipment,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:10%
operating in a
tele-engineering collaboration

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.797 align:middle line:10%
with our engineering
support team.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:14.046 align:middle line:84%
Then they gotta take care
of the chores of daily life.

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
They've got to get along
with each other while getting

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
all of this done because look,
we're not going to Mars just

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to sit around and see
if we can endure it.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:90%
We're going to Mars to explore.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:10%
And that's where the
human factors challenges

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:10%
come in-- trying to
get real work done

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.140 align:middle line:10%
under very difficult
conditions and stick together

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:10%
as a team that way.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY:
Psychologically, are you

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:10%
going to be looking
at these six people

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:10%
as well, just to
see how they adapt

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:10%
with each other and
everything else?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Sure.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:10%
But the issue of how well
the psychology holds up

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:10%
is once again dependent upon
the workload put on them,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.999 align:middle line:10%
the risks they face, and all
of these other difficulties.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.415 align:middle line:84%
For instance, and
look, if we were

00:02:50.415 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
to compare this
mission to Mars 500

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
which was a Mars
mission simulation that

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.004 align:middle line:84%
was done in Moscow
about two years ago,

00:02:58.004 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:84%
where they took a
bunch of people,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:84%
they put them in a room in
Moscow, closed the door,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and kept them in
there for 500 days,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
so they're sitting
around playing chess.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And well, there is
something to that.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I won't say we learned
nothing from that.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.157 align:middle line:90%
But still--

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they go nuts?

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: No.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:90%
They didn't go nuts.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:90%
They got bored.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:10%
What we find, though, when we
do our mission simulations,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:10%
is the characteristic human
factors challenge that is faced

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:10%
is not boredom but overwork
because we're asking people

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:10%
to try to get a lot
done, and they're

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:10%
doing it in these difficult
conditions where machinery

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.825 align:middle line:10%
breaks down, it's
hard to fix, you've

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:10%
got to figure out how to
fix it, it's cold weather,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:10%
you're trying to do this
in space suit gloves.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:90%
It is tough stuff.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, furthermore, just
that we have physical discomfort

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
where instead of just being
in a nice, comfortable room

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and taking hot
showers every morning,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
we ration water very
tightly, as it would

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:84%
have to be done on a Mars
mission, to limit consumption.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.118 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have a
good recycling system,

00:03:54.118 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:84%
you've got to ration
it real tight.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.052 align:middle line:84%
And so now you're
feeling grungy.

00:03:57.052 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
you're under the stress

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.804 align:middle line:90%
of getting work done.

00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
You're putting up
with the frustrations.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Then, here you are.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.990 align:middle line:84%
You're planning some
expedition to some cliff

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:90%
somewhere, to do this.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And just then, the
weather goes bad,

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:90%
or just then, the vehicles fail.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:10%
And now you have to stop.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:10%
And this and that.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:10%
And why did the vehicle fail?

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:10%
Because she left
the battery running.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:10%
And this and that.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.904 align:middle line:10%
And why did you do that?

00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:10%
How could you do that?

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:10%
You have screwed up my research.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.935 align:middle line:10%
And that's where you get the
human conflict-- not where

00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:29.472 align:middle line:10%
you're just sitting
around, saying you know,

00:04:29.472 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:10%
you want to play chess?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
going to watch TV?

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Is there TV for them?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.207 align:middle line:10%
And can you watch TV on Mars?

00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:40.540 align:middle line:10%
Will we have a system like that?

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, certainly, you
could bring a library of DVDs

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:10%
with you.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.991 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:10%
So you could bring that.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:10%
You can upload video.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:10%
And so then they would just
have it all right there.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:10%
In terms of
communication, with Earth,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:10%
it would be kind of like
having email conversations.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
That is, the time lag in
radio signal transmission

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
between Earth and
Mars, depending

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:84%
upon the relative
position of the planets,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.970 align:middle line:84%
can be as short as four
minutes and as long as 20.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:10%
And that's reminiscent of
an email conversation where

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.652 align:middle line:10%
you send someone an email,
and a half hour later,

00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:13.401 align:middle line:10%
you get an answer.

00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:14.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It shows up.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: And then
this and that.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And you could also
send video clips.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:90%
So you could have video emails.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, the
time lag in communication

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
would be somewhat like
email correspondence.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Good point.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
In text messaging, we
expect an answer right away.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:10%
Well, it also sometimes
doesn't happen on Earth.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.058 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:05:34.058 --> 00:05:34.557 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.557 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
The people who are volunteering
for this-- six people--

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.724 align:middle line:90%
how's the sexual makeup?

00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well--

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Men?

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Women?

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.026 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: We get both.

00:05:43.026 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I would say about 2/3
of our applications

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:90%
are men, and 1/3, women.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.299 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going
to pick both sexes?

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.465 align:middle line:10%
Well, first of all,
in the simulations

00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:10%
that we've done in the
desert and the Arctic,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.515 align:middle line:10%
we have picked both
sexes in various ratios.

00:05:57.515 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:10%


00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:10%
And in terms of
the Arctic mission,

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:10%
I anticipate having both men
and women in the mission.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I would probably guess that
the composition will reflect

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
the composition
of the volunteers.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I would say it is likely that
out of the six crew members,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
we would probably have
four men, two women.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What about
relationships out there?

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
They may fall in
love with each other,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.782 align:middle line:90%
or they may want to have sex?

00:06:26.782 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:90%
How do you handle that?

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.781 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, they may.

00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's various theories
on how that could or should

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:90%
be handled.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:84%
My own personal
point of view is you

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
want people who are stably
attached to other people who

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:90%
are not on the mission.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.430 align:middle line:84%
That is, I would
not want to have

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.246 align:middle line:84%
sexual or romantic competition
be going on in the crew.

00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:48.746 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:06:48.746 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:90%
That would be devastating.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.265 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
best way to do it.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:84%
If you send single people
who are uncommitted,

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.770 align:middle line:90%
then you will have--

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something will happen.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.535 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, yeah.

00:06:57.535 --> 00:06:59.729 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have a dating
competition, and so forth.

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.395 align:middle line:10%
And that's-- I think
that's undesirable.

00:07:01.395 --> 00:07:02.895 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, that
could be horrible.

00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:10%
So I would rather have-- and
now, you could send people,

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:10%
in the crew, who are
committed couples.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.356 align:middle line:84%
And this is, for instance,
the Inspiration Mars thing.

00:07:12.356 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:84%
They want to send a
man and a woman who

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
are a couple, either
married or otherwise

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:90%
in a solid relationship.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.499 align:middle line:84%
And that's OK for a
two person mission.

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And it might work for
a six person mission,

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:90%
to have three couples.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
There's something
to be said for it.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.645 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, a lot of
couples who come under a lot of

00:07:30.645 --> 00:07:31.145 align:middle line:90%
stress--

00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:32.407 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.407 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could go the other way.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.023 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Could go the other way.

00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Being in this
tough a situation together.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So, once this year
goes by, what kind of data

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:10%
do you expect to collect?

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, I think
we'll get a lot of data,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.285 align:middle line:84%
including of things
that we don't expect.

00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to see
strengths and weaknesses

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.039 align:middle line:90%
of various character types.

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going
to see who really

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
was most useful in the
crew, what kind of person.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I would say, by the way-- based
on the short-term simulations

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that we've done or sometimes
one month and so forth,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.579 align:middle line:84%
which is not that
short-- that you really

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
want people in the crew
to have a sense of humor.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:84%
You want to go to Mars
with people who can laugh.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:15.949 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
You want to go to
Mars with people

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
who, when something
stupid happens,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:84%
they laugh at it instead
of throwing a fit.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.702 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:23.700 align:middle line:90%
You don't need that.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: That you
really need to have that.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, yes, you do you want
to have people who are not

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.175 align:middle line:84%
ultra competitive
with each other.

00:08:31.175 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:37.260 align:middle line:84%
The Apollo crews, for
instance, were test pilots.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And these are type
A, very aggressive,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.885 align:middle line:90%
competitive personality.

00:08:40.885 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very competitive.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.299 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:46.946 align:middle line:84%
And this is fine for
a three day mission

00:08:46.946 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:84%
while outbound to the moon,
a one week round-trip mission

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:90%
to the moon.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.842 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But I know some of
the Apollo astronauts.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And I know some of
the Apollo astronauts

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.083 align:middle line:84%
who were on the same
mission with each other

00:08:56.083 --> 00:08:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and will not talk
to each other today.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
Aldrin and Armstrong talked

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:90%
a lot afterward.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Correct.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So those kinds of
people, you know,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
they were also previously
military pilots.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.997 align:middle line:84%
They certainly--
different people.

00:09:09.997 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And they could just suck it up
during the course of a one week

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.340 align:middle line:90%
mission.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But in the course of a 2 1/2
year mission-- six months out,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:84%
a year and a half on
Mars, six months back--

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:84%
you really want a team that's
one for all and all for one.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind
of team you want.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Once we go to Mars and
we start establishing bases,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.934 align:middle line:10%
are we going to replace
these people like you're

00:09:30.934 --> 00:09:33.350 align:middle line:10%
going to be there for a year,
then we take you out and put

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:10%
somebody else in,
or are they going

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:10%
to stay permanently-- it's
going to be their planet?

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, I
think, once again,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.335 align:middle line:10%
what you'll see first
are the explorers.

00:09:43.335 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll
see the settlers.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:90%
And explorers go round-trip.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:90%
And settlers go one way.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they do.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.101 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: That's what we saw in
the early history of America.

00:09:52.101 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
going to see on Mars.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of
gender composition,

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I think the explorers, by
the nature of the thing,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:90%
tend to be mostly men.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Settlers will be 50-50 because
men can open a frontier,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:84%
but it takes women
to conquer it.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And this
will be all geared

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:10%
toward terraforming
Mars, eventually,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.436 align:middle line:10%
so they don't have to
wear gas-- oxygen masks

00:10:16.436 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:10%
and things like that?

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well,
it goes in stages.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The first-- the explorers,
they want to learn about Mars,

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.335 align:middle line:84%
want to learn where
the resources are.

00:10:23.335 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
to see things, look

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.790 align:middle line:90%
at fossils if there are any.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, there's that.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:10%
There's the scientific
exploration.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.156 align:middle line:10%
But there's also
the prospecting--

00:10:29.156 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:10%
find out where
the resources are,

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:10%
find out where we can
drill and bring up

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.120 align:middle line:10%
geothermally heated
water that'll

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.557 align:middle line:10%
give us hot water and power.

00:10:35.557 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of things.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Find out where
other resources are.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.661 align:middle line:90%
Stuff like that.

00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And maybe do some
heavy work, establish

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.282 align:middle line:84%
the first greenhouses, get them
going so that they'll be up

00:10:47.282 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and running when the
colonists show up-- you've

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:90%
got your farms already running.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Then you get the colonists.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:90%
And they go there.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they're going
to want to greatly expand

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
the greenhouse
agricultural base.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:90%
They're farmers.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:90%
They're miners.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:90%
They're builders.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.521 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:10%
And then, after the farmers,
miners, and builders come,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:10%
the teachers and the
community orchestra

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:10%
conductors and the publishers
and those kinds of people.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.641 align:middle line:10%
And you create a society.

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.716 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, once this
is well established

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and it is developing
a pace, then

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:84%
you begin the question of
how do we terraform Mars?

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So first, we've got to
do the reconnaissance.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Then we've got to dig in.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got to
take the beach.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.739 align:middle line:90%
And then we take the continent.

00:11:35.739 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I believe
that the primordial soup

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
in the universe is the same,
what are the possibilities

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:84%
that there will be gold on
Mars and uranium on Mars

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.456 align:middle line:84%
and maybe diamonds on Mars if it
had a carbon base at some time?

00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: I think the
probability, certainly,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:10%
of being gold and silver and
things of this sort on Mars

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:10%
is very high.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Mars has had a very
complex geological history,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.080 align:middle line:84%
comparable to the
Earth in that respect.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.871 align:middle line:90%
It's had volcanism.

00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:84%
It's had, also,
hydrologic action.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's had all of
these processes that

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
are necessary to
create mineral ore.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Diamonds could be
a little different

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.810 align:middle line:84%
because they require carbon
deposits which typically left

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:84%
by large quantities
of life forms.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But certainly gold and rhodium
and platinum and all of this

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:90%
could be.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it, why is

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:84%
gold hard to find
on Earth right now?

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.832 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
past 5,000 years,

00:12:33.832 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:84%
people have gone
around, picking up

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:90%
all of the stuff that was easy.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: As much
as they could find.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.424 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: All of the stuff
that's been easy to find

00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:10%
has been found.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:10%
But we haven't had Egyptians
and Aztecs and Incas and Chinese

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:10%
and people like this running
around Mars for the past 7,000

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:10%
years, picking up all
the easy to find gold.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It should
be there, right?

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: So therefore,
it should be there.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.125 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The probabilities
there are endless.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:10%


00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:10%
If Mars was once,
you know, ladened

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:10%
the way we talked about
in our previous show.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.095 align:middle line:84%
It had oceans and, you
know, it's got the gold

00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:90%
and it's got all of that.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:84%
How would we mine that
and get it back here?

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, first
of all, the mining part

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
would be relatively simple
because what we'd be going for,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
initially, is the
easy to find stuff--

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
the kind of stuff that
ancient Egyptians and Incas

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.521 align:middle line:90%
and so forth could find.

00:13:26.521 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:10%
So we would not need the same
degree of chemical processing

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:10%
that is now needed to
isolate, for instance, gold.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of sending it back
here, what we would want to do

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:84%
is we'd want to have reusable
surface-to-orbit vehicles that

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.445 align:middle line:84%
could run, for instance, on
methane and oxygen rocket

00:13:47.445 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
propellant, which is a
kind-- in other words,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Mars has got water.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It's got CO2.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
With those two ingredients, we
can make methane and oxygen.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:90%
I've done this in my lab.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:90%
And others have done, too.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can make rocket
fuel and oxidizer on Mars.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:84%
These vehicles would fly
the stuff up to orbit,

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and then the vehicles
would return.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.524 align:middle line:84%
Now, what would happen,
then, from orbit?

00:14:07.524 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of
things that could be done.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:16.710 align:middle line:84%
We could have catapults
on, for instance, Phobos,

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.090 align:middle line:84%
the Martian moon, that
could shoot the stuff

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:84%
on trans-Earth
trajectory, encased

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.540 align:middle line:84%
within capsules that would
protect it at reentry at Earth,

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:90%
and then it could be picked up.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.437 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Almost like
cargo train things, right?

00:14:29.437 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:10%
Or there's a technology
that would probably

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:10%
be useful for this application.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:10%
It's called solar sails.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.980 align:middle line:10%
These are sails made of
foils coated with aluminum.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:90%
And they're very lightweight.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:90%
They're big.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Light-- sunlight--
has pushing power.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.867 align:middle line:84%
And it can be used
to propel things.

00:14:49.867 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, it takes a while
to travel around

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
the solar system
with this technology.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.166 align:middle line:84%
But the advantage is it
doesn't need any propellant.

00:14:55.166 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How fast
are they going?

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Well,
it would probably

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:10%
take a couple of
years for one of these

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:10%
to travel between
Mars and Earth.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To get back here?

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But a pretty
good clip, though.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:10%
But the idea, then, is that
these things could travel

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:10%
endlessly back and forth
between Earth and Mars,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.747 align:middle line:10%
delivering the cargo from
Mars orbit to Earth orbit

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:10%
where they could be
allowed to reenter

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:10%
and be picked up
out of the ocean

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:10%
or they could even be
delivered to some Earth orbital

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:10%
installation.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.545 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that, you
know, during Apollo, it

00:15:25.545 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:84%
was a common refrain that
even if there were diamonds

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.777 align:middle line:84%
on the moon, it would not
pay there to go and fetch

00:15:31.777 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
them and bring them back
because the mission would

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:90%
cost more than that.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
true, at that time.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.543 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: If that there
were diamonds on the moon,

00:15:38.543 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't pay to send
Apollo missions to gather

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:90%
them and bring them back.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:10%
But if you had people
living on the moon

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:10%
and there were
diamonds on the moon,

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:10%
it would absolutely pay for them
to run around and gather these

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.893 align:middle line:10%
up and shoot them back to Earth.

00:15:52.893 --> 00:15:53.296 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:53.296 --> 00:15:53.837 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:15:53.837 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:10%
So yes.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
If there are valuable
minerals on Mars,

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.870 align:middle line:90%
a trade could be set up.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
we know exists

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, which is
extremely valuable,

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:90%
is deuterium-- heavy hydrogen.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.425 align:middle line:84%
This is fuel for
fusion reactors and it

00:16:10.425 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:84%
has a number of other
important applications as well.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It's six times more common
on Mars than it is on Earth.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you had a Martian
civilization-- and all life

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.062 align:middle line:84%
support systems that we use
in space involve a step where

00:16:25.062 --> 00:16:27.103 align:middle line:84%
there's water electrolysis--
where you take water

00:16:27.103 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and you electrolyze it,
you release oxygen-- well,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:84%
if you were doing that on
Mars, if you're electrolyzing

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:84%
the oxygen out of water to
provide oxygen for the colony,

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:84%
you'd be releasing
a lot of hydrogen.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And this hydrogen would
be rich in deuterium.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are methods
of separating deuterium

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:90%
from ordinary hydrogen.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is worth
a lot of money.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:84%
That's worth like
$10,000 a kilogram.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And so that's
only somewhat less valuable

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
than gold.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:10%
And we know it's there.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If the
abiotic oil theory

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:10%
is correct on this planet--
that this planet has

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:10%
an abundance of oil,
always was here,

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.625 align:middle line:10%
not fossil fuels-- if
that theory is correct,

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:10%
does that mean Mars,
too, might have oil?

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: If that
theory is correct.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.016 align:middle line:84%
I have my doubts
about that theory.

00:17:15.016 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
But if that theory
is correct, there's

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.577 align:middle line:84%
no reason why there
wouldn't be oil on Mars.

00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That is exciting.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, you have also written a
book called "Energy Victory"

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.310 align:middle line:10%
by Robert Zubrin.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:10%
Robert, what perspective
do you take in this work?

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.109 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, what
"Energy Victory"

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:31.900 align:middle line:10%
is about-- it's about how
the United States can become

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:10%
independent and
secure in energy,

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:10%
and in fact, how we can break
this cartel that is restricting

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:10%
the world's access to liquid
fuels for its own profit

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:10%
and greatly damaging
our economy, that

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:10%
of the rest of the
industrial world,

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:10%
and frankly, even much more, the
third world, where people can

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.614 align:middle line:10%
afford expensive oil
much less than we can.

00:17:51.614 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And dictating
political events.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.238 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: That's right.

00:17:54.238 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:10%
Look, oil, as it is now--
as a natural resource--

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:10%
it gives powers to
tyrannies because,

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:10%
see, they don't have to
develop the intellectual and

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.850 align:middle line:10%
educational accomplishments
of their people.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to let their
people be free to be creative

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:84%
in order to generate
wealth to sustain them.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.509 align:middle line:84%
And so in Saudi Arabia
and these other places--

00:18:15.509 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Kuwait.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Kuwait.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.305 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, to
an extent, Russia.

00:18:19.305 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:84%
All the regime
needs is ownership

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
of the oil and security guards
to protect their ownership.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of
people can go to Hell.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:10%
There's lots of
ways to make energy.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:10%
But right now, from a
practical point of view,

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.230 align:middle line:10%
the only way to do
transportation is liquid fuels.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.089 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.089 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, electric
cars are still out there

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.713 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:18:40.713 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And the only practical
liquid fuel, right now,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.645 align:middle line:84%
are those gasoline and diesel
fuel petroleum derivatives.

00:18:48.645 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:10%
However, we, in
the United States,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:10%
and others around
the world now have

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:10%
vast supplies of natural
gas, vast supplies of coal,

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:10%
vast supplies of biomass.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:10%
And all of these things can be
readily turned into methanol.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:10%
Not ethanol, methanol.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Methanol.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.190 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: It's the
simplest alcohol.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, what good is that?

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Can cars be made
to run on methanol?

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.319 align:middle line:90%
The answer is absolutely yes.

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, now, if I
was selling a methanol car

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:90%
right now, nobody would buy it.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, what am I going
to go with a methanol car?

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Where can I fill up?

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where-- that's right.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where's the station?

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:10%
So what my argument is
is that what we need

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:10%
is a law that
requires automakers

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:10%
to make all new cars sold
in this country fully

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:36.205 align:middle line:10%
flex fuel-- able to run equally
well on methanol, ethanol,

00:19:36.205 --> 00:19:36.990 align:middle line:10%
and gasoline.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Add a switch?

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, actually,
you don't even need a switch.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:40.556 align:middle line:10%
The car does it all.

00:19:40.556 --> 00:19:41.055 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:41.596 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: OK?

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:10%
And it can run on mixtures of
methanol and gasoline, mixtures

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:10%
of methanol, ethanol,
and gasoline.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.669 align:middle line:10%
This is entirely doable.

00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or all methanol?

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Or all methanol.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: But the idea is as
follows-- is that it would not

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.696 align:middle line:84%
add very much to
the cost of a car,

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:90%
to give it this capability.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it would add nothing.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:90%
It's all in the software.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And I, myself, have taken
a used Chevy Cobalt 2007

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and activated the
software to make

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:90%
it able to run in this fashion.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Does it work well?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:90%
It runs very well.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And on methanol--
OK, on gasoline,

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:90%
it gets 36 miles to the gallon.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:90%
On methanol, it gets 24.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.235 align:middle line:84%
But methanol costs 1/3
as much as gasoline.

00:20:20.235 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And it
gets 2/3 the miles.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So it actually gets
twice the fuel economy.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Saves you money.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: OK,
now-- but more than

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.091 align:middle line:10%
that, methanol is a
fuel we can make here.

00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.617 align:middle line:90%
Easily.

00:20:31.617 --> 00:20:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
about the emission?

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Less than gasoline.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: And the--
so here's the thing.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:10%
If we made it the law
that to sell a car--

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:10%
new car-- in the
United States, it

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:10%
had to be flex fuel with
methanol capability,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.091 align:middle line:10%
then within three
years, about 30%

00:20:48.091 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:10%
of the cars being actively
driven in the United States

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:10%
would have this capability.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, we'd start
seeing methanol pumps appearing

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.460 align:middle line:10%
at every 7-Eleven.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All of them.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:10%
That's right.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:10%
All over the place.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: So, initially, the
people that got these cars

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.095 align:middle line:10%
would just fill
up with unleaded,

00:21:00.095 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:10%
just like they do now.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.496 align:middle line:84%
But once there
were enough of them

00:21:02.496 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:84%
out there to compose
a market, then people

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
would start selling
to that market.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, this
country's vast coal reserves,

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:10%
the vast natural
gas reserves, that

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:10%
are now being flared because
we have no use for it,

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:10%
would all become usable
as motor vehicle fuel.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:10%
And this would happen
all over the world.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And what this would
do would set gasoline

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:84%
into competition with methanol
at the pump everywhere

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And this would crash
the price of oil.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
It would bring the price of
oil down to about $50 a barrel.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:10%
And just in terms of
the price reduction

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:10%
alone, this would
save the United States

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.926 align:middle line:10%
about $200 billion a year--

00:21:43.926 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: --which is like 4
million jobs at $50,000 a year

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:10%
each.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84%
But it would do more than
that because since we're

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
the ones making it, we would
no longer be importing any oil.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.186 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.186 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And many other of our
allies would not be.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And this would be
a tremendous boon

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.740 align:middle line:84%
to people in the
third world, to have

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
a price break on fuel
and also, in many cases,

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.750 align:middle line:84%
be able to make the
fuel themselves.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.333 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:10%
And also minimize our
political involvement

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:10%
with so many of these countries.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.723 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:22:11.723 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
This would make the Middle
East no longer strategically

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And so Saudi Arabia
could make money

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:84%
on tourists going
to see the shrines.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:10%
But they wouldn't
be looting the world

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:10%
for half a trillion
dollars a year of oil.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:10%
And they would
then have to start

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.290 align:middle line:10%
thinking about
seriously developing

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:10%
the intellectual capital
of their population,

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:10%
educating them, freeing them.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know, in the
Middle East right now,

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.984 align:middle line:84%
it's the countries
with the least

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:84%
oil have the most
freedom because that's

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:90%
the curse of natural resources.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:45.846 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:22:45.846 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And this
would turn that around.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
This would greatly
lower the threshold

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.967 align:middle line:84%
or the causes of
conflict in the world.

00:22:52.967 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look--

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you take away
hate if you begin to educate.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.786 align:middle line:10%
But you also take--
you see, look,

00:22:57.786 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:10%
the methanol is
something you make.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.420 align:middle line:10%
Oil is something you find.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.810 align:middle line:10%
Shoes are something you make.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.660 align:middle line:84%
They're a necessity,
but you make them.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a
war over shoe supplies.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:84%
There's never going to be
a war over shoe supplies.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.259 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:23:12.259 --> 00:23:14.550 align:middle line:10%
It's not like you capture a
certain piece of territory,

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:10%
and now you have the
world's monopoly on shoes

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.755 align:middle line:10%
because even if you took
some country where they're

00:23:19.755 --> 00:23:21.630 align:middle line:10%
making all of the shoes,
if you try to rig up

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:10%
the price of shoes,
everybody else will just

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.695 align:middle line:10%
start making them themselves.

00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: So methanol is
something that you make.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:84%
A natural resource is
something that you take.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
If it's something
that you make, you

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:84%
become more wealthy by
increasing the skill

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:84%
of your population
and of your people

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:90%
and becoming more creative.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:90%
And so you want to be freer.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way forward here.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:10%
So the key issue is this.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:10%
We, right now--
right now, we have

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:10%
all of the natural
resources we need

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.595 align:middle line:10%
to be energy independent
and energy secure.

00:23:58.595 --> 00:23:59.442 align:middle line:10%


00:23:59.442 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We always did.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.025 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:24:01.025 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:10%
But the problem is is
our cars can't use them.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: We're like a person
who is starving to death,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:10%
even though his house is
filled with all kinds of food

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.070 align:middle line:10%
except herring, because
he has convinced himself

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:10%
that he has to live
only on herring.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.830 align:middle line:10%
So he says, there's no
herring in the house.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.900 align:middle line:10%
I've got no food.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:10%
And somebody comes up,
well, I'll sell you herring.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.972 align:middle line:10%
I'll sell it to you
for $100 a pound.

00:24:25.972 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:10%
He says, oh, thank you.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.870 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for your $100 herring.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.364 align:middle line:10%
But somebody comes
by and says, why

00:24:30.364 --> 00:24:31.530 align:middle line:10%
are you just eating herring?

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.609 align:middle line:10%
You've got lamb chops.

00:24:32.609 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:10%
You've got carrots.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.582 align:middle line:10%
You've got potatoes.

00:24:34.582 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:10%
You've got cantaloupes.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.017 align:middle line:10%
What are you doing here,
spending $100 a pound

00:24:38.017 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:10%
on herring when you've
got all of this food?

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.780 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, I don't know
how to eat that kind of food.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:90%
He says, well, it's easy.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.001 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:24:45.001 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.656 align:middle line:90%
And we can become free.

00:24:48.656 --> 00:24:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we don't
have a program, Robert.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:54.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a quality
energy victory program.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:55.414 align:middle line:90%
And we should.

00:24:55.414 --> 00:24:55.996 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody should
get this book in Washington

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and say, let's
implement this thing.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:00.676 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:25:00.676 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we've had
since this book was first

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:84%
published in its first
edition, back in 2008,

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.290 align:middle line:84%
there's been several repeated
attempts in Congress,

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and I must say by
members of both parties,

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.470 align:middle line:90%
to introduce this as policy.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:10%
It was called the Open
Fuel Standard Act.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.094 align:middle line:10%
And what it did was a bill
that would simply require,

00:25:18.094 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:10%
if you want to sell
a new car in the US,

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:10%
it must have this capability.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:84%
We don't want you selling cars
in this country that can only

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.060 align:middle line:90%
run on the enemy's fuels.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: They've got to
also be able to run on--

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great idea.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: --the
fuels we can make.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.452 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:25:30.452 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: What would happen
is we would get around

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:10%
20 cosponsors in the
House and, you know,

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.834 align:middle line:10%
5 or 10 in the Senate.

00:25:36.834 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And they'd come
from both parties.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I-- just
illustration of people.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
One particular year, the
Senate Democrat sponsor

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:84%
was Maria Cantwell, who's a
liberal democrat in Washington

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.530 align:middle line:84%
state, and there
was Sam Brownback,

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
who's a conservative
republican from Kansas,

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of
people in between.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.920 align:middle line:84%
In the House, we had people,
from New York liberals

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to Allen West, who's a
Tea Party conservative.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:90%
But there'd only be 10 or 20.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And to actually try to get
a bill passed in the House,

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.637 align:middle line:84%
well, obviously you
need over 200 votes.

00:26:08.637 --> 00:26:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And in the
Senate, you need over 50.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And you need some powerhouses
there, herding these cats.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, you need to
have the White House out there,

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:17.775 align:middle line:90%
herding the cats.

00:26:17.775 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And we
haven't had that.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the White
House is off there,

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:84%
trying to fix the weather by
stopping people from burning

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:84%
fuels, when really, the
job of the government

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:84%
should be to make
sure that Americans

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.319 align:middle line:84%
have fuels available to
them, plentiful and cheap--

00:26:33.319 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: --and not trying to
stop them from using fuels.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have no policy.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.554 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
policy for anything.

00:26:40.554 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
need to change that.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.368 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: That's right.

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
other thing here

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.995 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
power in the world.

00:26:47.995 --> 00:26:51.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, the oil business
involves a great deal of money.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.974 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it's about
power-- power to rule.

00:26:53.974 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And military might.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.098 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: That's right.

00:26:56.098 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:10%
During World War II,
the United States

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:10%
produced twice as much oil as
the whole rest of the world

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:10%
put together.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's why our side won.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Now we produce 8%.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And most of the rest is
produced by countries

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.430 align:middle line:90%
that are opposed to freedom.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And if we can do this,
we not only get out

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:84%
from under their power--
we break their power.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:84%
It's oil money that's
funding the jihadis.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.074 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:27:21.074 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: It's oil funding--

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exactly right.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:25.565 align:middle line:90%
They funded the 9/11 terrorists.

00:27:25.565 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's Saudi money
that funds the Taliban that

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:10%
is at war with us right
now in Afghanistan.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:10%
So they're looting us
and using the money

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:10%
they get to wage war on us.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.952 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
important thing we

00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:40.410 align:middle line:84%
could do for our
national security.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.993 align:middle line:84%
It's the most important
thing we could

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:84%
do to make sure that
the world of the future

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.992 align:middle line:84%
is led by free nations
and not by slave nations.

>>NOORY: People want to
track you, follow you--

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:49.800 align:middle line:90%
where do they go?

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, to--
about Mars, they

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.018 align:middle line:10%
should go to marssociety.org.

00:27:53.018 --> 00:27:53.527 align:middle line:10%


00:27:53.527 --> 00:27:55.610 align:middle line:10%
About energy, they should
go to energyvictory.net.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:56.375 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Robert, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: All right.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So one day, we'll get
men and women on Mars.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.580 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to go
through that process now.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully it will
be in our lifetime.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.320 align:middle line:10%
And then, also, maybe we'll
have an energy victory,

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.990 align:middle line:10%
where we can really change
the face on this planet.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thank you
for watching "Beyond Belief."
