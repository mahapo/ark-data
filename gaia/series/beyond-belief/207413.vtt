>>RIZWAN VIRK: Someday
we'll be able to create

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.110 align:middle line:84%
a video game that's
indistinguishable

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.250 align:middle line:90%
from physical reality.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Interesting.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.055 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: And so
it's very possible

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that something similar is going
on in the world around us.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is the
creator of the simulation?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Some people
say it's aliens.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.050 align:middle line:84%
It's future versions
of ourselves.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
There are others who say it's
God or pure consciousness.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it kind
of sad to think

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:90%
we're living in a simulation?

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: We can look at
the challenges in life

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
perhaps we set up

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.910 align:middle line:84%
those challenges for
ourselves as ways for us

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:90%
to level up the soul.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.530 align:middle line:84%
If any civilization
anywhere in the galaxy ever

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:84%
reaches the point of
creating simulations,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:84%
then you and I are more likely
in a simulation than not.

to "Beyond Belief."

And you're going to hear a story
tonight on the program that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:10%
is just going to make
you go, "Oh my gosh."

Rizwan Virk is a successful
entrepreneur, investor,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
video game industry pioneer,
independent film producer,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:90%
and best-selling author.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:84%
In his latest book, "The
Simulation Hypothesis,"

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
an MIT computer scientist shows
why artificial intelligence,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics,
and Eastern mystics

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
agree that we are
living in a video game.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:90%
And you believe this, don't you?

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Yeah, well, I believe
it's more likely than not.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:10%
And based on my experience
and how we build video games,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:10%
I started to investigate the
weirdness of quantum physics.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.550 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that
there's no good explanation

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:10%
for some of that weirdness.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:10%
But it turns out
within video games,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:10%
we render the world
just as you need it.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're able to
build entire video game 3D

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
worlds, like "World of Warcraft"
or "Fortnite" or "The Sims."

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very possible that
something similar is going

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
on in the world around us.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Riz, Elon
Musk believes we're

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
living in a simulated
matrix as well, doesn't he?

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: Yeah.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:84%
And he made the point
that 40 years ago, we

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.645 align:middle line:84%
had "Pong," which was the first
commercially available video

00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:13.445 align:middle line:90%
game.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used
to play that game.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Yeah, it was just
two squares and a dot.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Boop, boop, boop, boop.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: And today we
have virtual reality

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:90%
and augmented reality.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I got
interested in this whole idea

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
of the simulation was
related to "Pong."

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I was actually playing ping
pong in virtual reality.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So I put on the
headset and I started

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:90%
playing this ping pong game.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And at the end I forgot I was
in a virtual reality game.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to put the
paddle down on the table

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and lean against the table,
but there was no table.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Just like there's no
spoon in the movie

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
"The Matrix," that's
when I realized

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that our technology was getting
good enough that someday we'll

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:84%
be able to create
a video game that's

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.045 align:middle line:84%
indistinguishable
from physical reality.

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: And I call that
the simulation point, which

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:90%
we're on track to get to.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is the
creator of the simulation?

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, that's the
big $64 million question.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Some people say it's aliens.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a professor
at Oxford who

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:84%
wrote a paper about this back
in 2003 named Nick Bostrom.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks it's future
versions of ourselves.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So he thinks we're in what we'd
call an ancestor simulation.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Like if we created a
game of ancient Rome,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
they would be like our
ancestors in a way.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
There are others who say it's
God or pure consciousness,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:90%
outside of the matrix.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So all the religions, not
just any specific religion,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:84%
but pretty much all of
them have been telling us

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
that the physical world
is not the real world,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that there's another world
out there beyond this.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that's yet another
theory of what's outside.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
this is probable, possible?

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: I believe it's probable,
like more than a 50% chance

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that we are inside
some type of--

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are
pretty high odds.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: Well, yeah.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And as I studied the
different religions,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
they were telling us

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:84%
the same thing that
modern computer

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
science and that modern
physics is starting to tell us

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of reality.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if somebody or
something shut this game off

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:90%
instantly?

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:90%
What would happen to us?

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, this
depends a little bit

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:84%
on what I call the NPC
version or the RPG version.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So NPC means
non-player character.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And those are the characters
inside the video games

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:90%
that are just AI--

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:84%
the bank teller or
the bartender or the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:90%
orcs that you're fighting.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the RPG
version or the role-playing game

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:90%
version.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
characters that we play.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you and I
were in a game, we

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.707 align:middle line:84%
would have avatars
within the game.

00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
when you shut down

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
a game if you're playing,
like "World of Warcraft,"

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
or if you had a virtual
reality headset on?

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.865 align:middle line:84%
You take off the headset
and there's still

00:04:52.865 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:90%
you outside of the game.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is in something
like "The Matrix," if you

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
remember, Keanu Reeves and
Morpheus and the others,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
they had those
wires that connected

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:90%
into the back of their brain.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So they forgot that they
were inside a video game.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:90%
They didn't realize it.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the other hand, if we're
just non-player characters,

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
if we're just AI within the
game and you shut off the game,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
then those characters
go to sleep until you

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.787 align:middle line:90%
can restart those again.

00:05:19.787 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, Elon Musk is
working on neurolinks.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.925 align:middle line:84%
He wants us all to have
computer chips in our brains.

00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: That's right.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So in my book, I lay out
the 10 stages of technology

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
that we would need to
develop to build something

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
like "The Matrix" or reach what
I call the simulation point.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And stage seven is brain
computer interfaces,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:90%
which is what Elon Musk--

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we are.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: --is working on.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you saw the video, he
was able to teach a monkey

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
to play a video game
using a joystick.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Then they disconnected
the joystick

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and they just read the
monkey's brain signals as he

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:90%
moved this joystick around.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.183 align:middle line:84%
And using the brain
signals, he was

00:05:55.183 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
able to play the same game
we've been talking about,

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:84%
"Pong," with the two
squares and the dot.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we're getting
better at being

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:90%
able to read our brain signals.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
But we can't write
to the brain yet.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.488 align:middle line:84%
So we can't do what they did
in "The Matrix" just yet.

00:06:08.488 --> 00:06:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
quantum physicists saying

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.200 align:middle line:90%
about theories like this?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, quantum physics
has one or two major mysteries,

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
one of which is called quantum
indeterminacy or the observer

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.355 align:middle line:84%
And the best way
to explain it is

00:06:23.355 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:90%
the idea of Schrodinger's cat.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
cat who's in a box.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And he has a 50% chance of
being alive after an hour

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:90%
and a 50% chance of being dead.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.175 align:middle line:84%
Now, we would say, common
sense tells us the cat is alive

00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:35.975 align:middle line:90%
or the cat is dead.

00:06:35.975 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:90%
It can't be both.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you open it up, we'll
find out which one was true

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:90%
and the other one wasn't true.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But what quantum physicists
tell us is that's not right.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.213 align:middle line:90%
The cat is both alive and dead--

00:06:47.213 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --at the same time.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.505 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: --at the same time.

00:06:49.505 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:84%
It's what's called a
superposition state.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It has both values until
somebody opens up the box

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and looks at the cat,
until it's observed.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a mystery
that can't be explained

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:90%
within quantum physics.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But as I said earlier,
this makes perfect sense

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
if we live inside a
video game, because if we

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
play a video game, I only see
what's rendered on my computer.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And you only see what's
rendered on your computer,

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
just like we might think
we're in the same room,

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's just our avatars
that are in the same room.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can only see
what's over there

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and you can only see
what's over there.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it is that
got you thinking this way?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just didn't
wake up one morning

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and say, "We're
living in a matrix."

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: No, it really took
the development of the physics

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
engines and the graphical
engines of our video games.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was involved in making a
bunch of games for the iPhone

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
back when the iPhone
first came out.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And those were not
super high resolution.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.740 align:middle line:84%
But as the engines got
better and the resolution

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.450 align:middle line:84%
got to 2K, 4K, 8K resolution,
it became so good.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the resolution
is no longer the problem.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
It now it's just about
how responsive is it.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was playing
ping pong in virtual reality,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:84%
it felt like I was
really hitting a ball.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:90%
But there was no ball.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So as the responsiveness
of the engines

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:84%
got better, as the graphics
in video games got better,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that's what got me thinking
about how long would it

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
take for us to reach
the simulation point.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
to investigate and write

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:90%
this book.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.083 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Riz, researcher Linda
Moulton Howe and I had a chance

00:08:30.083 --> 00:08:33.950 align:middle line:84%
to discuss the possibilities
of ancient religions

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and how they
figured out if we're

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:90%
living in a simulated universe.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.287 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
Professor Campbell

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:47.420 align:middle line:84%
thinks that this universe was
made to be an entropy reduction

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:90%
trainer for souls.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
talking about that,

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking of Gnosticism
and Zoroastrianism, which goes

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.708 align:middle line:90%
back more than 2,000 years.

00:08:57.708 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm glad you're
pronouncing these words.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
Well, I tell you,

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I recommend to everybody to
read about Zoroastrianism

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and Gnosticism,
because in many ways

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:84%
it may be the key to
why anybody simulated

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:84%
this universe in
the first place.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that this,
when you have entropy,

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:90%
it's energy winding down.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:84%
It's why this would be a
universe where death is the end

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:84%
of everything-- stars,
people, the universe--

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
but that there could
be many universes where

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:84%
time, the vector of
time goes to the past.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And that means there
would never be death.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:84%
There would be universes
of immortality.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Why then would this be
an entropy reduction

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:90%
trainer for souls?

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:90%
And he's talking as a physicist.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
He says, I really do think that
what we are underestimating

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:84%
is the importance
of the soul, spirit

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
as the whole key to everything
that is on this planet.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds biblical.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Well, it has
to do with the life force.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:84%
If, in fact, the
body containers,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking
about ETs, humans,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:84%
anything that is organic
life in this universe,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:90%
there is a life force.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And in the first law of
thermodynamics that physicists

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
live by, energy
cannot be destroyed.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:90%
It is always there reforming.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So the soul, spirit
of any entity

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:84%
would be the consciousness
relationship to the projector.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting into
the minds of any creature

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:84%
in this universe would be the
inner actor with the projector,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and that the body
containers are what

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.380 align:middle line:84%
would take the soul and spirit
around in this universe.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But the whole point, the
bottom line to everything

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:84%
is trying to live with
compassion, with love,

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
with sharing, not hate
and greed and jealousy,

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and that the more jealousy,
the more hate, the more

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
war, the faster the universe
runs down with entropy.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we're living
in a simulated universe,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Riz, why do we feel pain?

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have emotion?

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, some
people will say

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that if they were to design
the universe as a simulation,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't have
any of those things.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, if you remember
in the second and third

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.610 align:middle line:84%
"Matrix" movie, they revealed
that the first version

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of the matrix was
one where everything

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:84%
was peaceful and blissful,
and the human mind

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
didn't accept that
as a full reality.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it turns out we may
need some element of struggle,

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
just like in an "Indiana
Jones" movie, right?

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:84%
If Indy Jones just got
the map at the beginning

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and said, here's the Ark
of the Covenant, go get it,

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
well, that doesn't make for
a very interesting movie.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
design video games,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:84%
we have to create levels
and achievements and quests

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.980 align:middle line:90%
in increasing difficulty.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the pain and
the disappointments

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and the suffering that are
there are built into the game,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe, as
obstacles or challenges

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:84%
for us to overcome
as we level up.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does science
contribute to this possibility

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:90%
that we're in a matrix?

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, science is
about discovering the rules

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:90%
of the physical universe.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
when science looks

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:84%
for this thing
called matter, right,

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
it's like opening up
those Russian dolls.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.537 align:middle line:90%
They can't find matter.

00:12:45.537 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's one
inside of another and--

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.578 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Yeah, and they just
keep finding empty space.

00:12:49.578 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom
level, turns out

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:84%
what physicists are telling us
is that it's all information.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So there was a famous physicist
named John Wheeler, who

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.190 align:middle line:84%
was one of the last guys who
worked with Einstein and Niels

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Bohr, the fathers
of quantum physics.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
in his lifetime,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
physics went from everything
must be a particle,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:84%
like a solid ball, to
everything must be a field,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.510 align:middle line:84%
like a magnetic field, to
everything is information.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And so he coined a phrase
called "it from bit."

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have an
it, like this chair,

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle line:84%
it's a physical object, but
it's really composed of bits.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So at the bottom level, the
only thing they could find

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
were a bunch of questions,
yes-no questions.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:90%
And what does that sound like?

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like computer bits.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And so even science is
turning towards this idea

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
of digital physics, which is
that the physical world is

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:90%
one of information.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And now we just saw that
video where Linda Moulton Howe

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:84%
discussed the entropy
and the second--

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:90%
and the laws of thermodynamics.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's a new
type of entropy,

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
which is information entropy
and conservation of information,

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
destroy information.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And so even physics
itself, which

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:84%
used to be about
the material world,

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.140 align:middle line:84%
is evolving to be about
the information that

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
can be contained in
the physical world.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
control the outcome

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:90%
of this video game we're in?

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, it depends on
the type of game we're in.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And so if you play, say,
Dungeons and Dragons,

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:84%
like I used to play when I was
a kid, you choose a character

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and you choose the attributes--
the height, the strength,

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:90%
the agility, and the profession.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you decide
that you're going to go

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:90%
on a campaign or a story arc.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And so within that
story arc, you

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:84%
can make all the
decisions along the way.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
each of us comes here

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.070 align:middle line:84%
with certain
achievements or quests,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
like, for example, I knew I was
always going to be a computer

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:50.927 align:middle line:90%
software entrepreneur.

00:14:50.927 --> 00:14:52.385 align:middle line:84%
If you had asked
me in high school,

00:14:52.385 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm going to be
a software entrepreneur

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.777 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going
to be a writer.

00:14:55.777 --> 00:14:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did I know that
when I was 12 or 13?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was just one of
those things that I knew.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And so each of us is
drawn to different areas,

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:84%
different professions,
different people.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
those things are part

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:90%
of our plan or our story arc.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But we have the freedom
to choose on the way

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:90%
where we end up.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
build, Riz, this matrix,

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:90%
starting from scratch?

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, if I were
to build this matrix,

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I would think about
the physical world.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I would think
about the characters

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to have
and what kinds of challenges

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:90%
those characters might have.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is why suffering
and pain are included.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we were in a game like
"Grand Theft Auto," right,

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.977 align:middle line:84%
everyone would be trying
to steal each other's cars

00:15:46.977 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:90%
and kill each other.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's one type of game.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that's the
type of game that we're in

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
or the type of game that I would
design, that we are in a game

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:84%
where each of us has a
difficulty level and each of us

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:90%
has to overcome that.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd figure out, how
do we store the information

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:90%
about that game?

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And in Silicon Valley,
we say that information

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
is stored in the cloud,
which, of course, sounds

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:90%
like a religious thing.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's really how we
store information these days

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:90%
in machines that can't be seen.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:90%
You don't know where they are.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
They're somewhere outside of
what you can see on the screen.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And so then you'd need a
way to download information

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:84%
from the player of the
game into the avatar.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the ancient religions,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:84%
they've basically been telling
us, you download into a body.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:90%
You live that life.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.640 align:middle line:90%
You have a story line.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:90%
You die.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Then all of your deeds
get recorded along the way

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and that you have
to review those.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And people who've had near-death
experiences, like Dannion

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Brinkley and
others, have told us

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:84%
they saw a holographic 360
panoramic life review, which

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:84%
means every single moment
of their lives is replayed

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:90%
and they can re-experience it.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out we can
do this in virtual reality.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
We can record, if you're playing
a game like "World of Warcraft"

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:84%
or "League of Legends"
or "Fortnite,"

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:90%
we can record the entire game.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Kids do it all the time and
they stream it on Twitch.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But we can replay it from
different coordinates.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:90%
So you can be your opponent.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:84%
You could be one of your
guild mates, for example.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it
from any point of view.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so if these things called
life reviews actually happen,

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.399 align:middle line:84%
then someone has to be
recording the information.

00:17:27.399 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: And so that's why if
I were to design the game,

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd think about the information
architecture of this world.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
physics is starting

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the world
is really about information

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:90%
and not physical objects.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who came
up with the concept

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that we could be
living in a simulation?

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, it's
a very old idea,

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
going back to Plato's
cave, 2,000 years ago,

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and the Hindu Vedas,
which are 5,000 years old,

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of
maya or illusion.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But in modern times, in 1977,
the science fiction writer

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.527 align:middle line:90%
Philip K. Dick gave a speech--

00:18:03.527 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: --at the Metz
Sci-Fi convention in France.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said we are living in
a computer programmed reality.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And the only clue we have is
when some variable is altered,

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:84%
some change in our
reality occurs.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
After that in 1999, you had
"The Matrix" and "The Thirteenth

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Floor" and other
fiction like that.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was really Oxford
philosophy Professor Nick

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Bostrom who came
out with a paper

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
in 2003, saying are you living
in a computer simulation?

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And he came up with something
called the simulation argument.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And the simulation argument
says either a society will get

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:84%
to this point that we've talked
about, the simulation point,

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:84%
where we can create matrix-like
simulations, or it won't.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And if it does, it will create
lots of simulations, millions

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
of them, because all you need
to do is fire up another server.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And so if there are
millions of simulated worlds

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and there's only
one base reality

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and we happen to be in a
world, which is more likely?

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
We're in one of these
or one of those.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And so its basic idea was
that if any civilization

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:84%
anywhere in the
galaxy ever reaches

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
the point of
creating simulations,

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.685 align:middle line:84%
then you and I are more likely
in a simulation than not.

00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
What do parallel universes
have to do with this puzzle?

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, Ralph Waldo
Emerson I think once

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:84%
said that it's no more
surprising that we

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
live multiple times
than that we live once.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when I interviewed Philip
K. Dick's wife for my book,

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
she said he believed there were
multiple timelines going on,

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and that all the people who
ran the simulation had to do

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:84%
was change a
variable and it would

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
generate a new run of the
simulation, if you will.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And he believed that
we had a run where

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
the Axis powers, Germany
and Japan, won World War II.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote his novel, "The
Man in the High Castle," which

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:90%
became a very popular--

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.212 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was a great book.

00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: --TV series
on Amazon recently,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and because he had memories
of this other timeline.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say if we
could be in one simulation,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:84%
then it wouldn't at
all be surprising

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:84%
if we couldn't run multiple
simulations on the same server,

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.435 align:middle line:90%
because that's what we do.

00:20:10.435 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:84%
If we're running a
simulation on the weather,

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:90%
we don't run one simulation.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
We run hundreds of
different simulations.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And so multiverse is
very hard to explain

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.150 align:middle line:90%
from a physical point of view.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But quantum physicists
say it's another solution

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.420 align:middle line:84%
to the observer effect
or the observer problem

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that we talked
about earlier, which

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:84%
means that every choice is
made generates a new universe.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
In one the cat is alive and
in the other the cat is dead.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's nothing in
nature that can clone itself.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:84%
The planet Earth doesn't clone
itself and create a new planet.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:84%
It takes a billion years
for a new planet to form.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But what can be cloned in
an instant is information.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And every single
computer processor

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
that's out there today
can take a bunch of bits

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:90%
and clone them very quickly.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So if there are
multiple universes,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:84%
it's more likely that
they are information

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:84%
or probable universes
than physical universes.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And then all we have
to do to see what's

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.910 align:middle line:84%
going on in any of
them is render them

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:84%
on our computer
screen, in the same way

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that you and I happen
to be rendering

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:84%
this particular universe or
this particular timeline.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually the
subject of my next book, which

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:84%
is called "The Simulated
Multiverse," which

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
is about this idea
that we don't just

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:84%
live in the single
simulation, but we

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.110 align:middle line:90%
may have run the simulation.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
experience certain things,

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.475 align:middle line:84%
like deja vu, where we think
we might have done this

00:21:33.475 --> 00:21:34.275 align:middle line:90%
once before.

00:21:34.275 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another time.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
On Gaia's "Mystery
Teachings" show,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:84%
physicist Dr.
Theresa Bullard talks

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
about why so many
physicists resist

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.862 align:middle line:90%
the idea of multiple universes.

00:21:46.862 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>THERESA BULLARD:
And that string theory

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
provides some exciting and
beautiful possibilities

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.570 align:middle line:84%
for discovering a unified
theory of everything.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And string theory is
what has opened the door

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
to the multiverse
idea in science.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:90%
How did it do that?

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, it goes back to the
issue that string theorists are

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
grappling with, the challenge of
identifying the exact geometry

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
of the super strings
and extra dimensions

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.530 align:middle line:90%
hidden within our universe.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.710 align:middle line:84%
They have many candidate
shapes allowed by the math,

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:84%
over 10 to the power of
500 possibilities, which

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
is a massive number, each
geometry theoretically

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to its own
universe with a different set

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:90%
of physical laws and tuning.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But rather than saying there
can be only one right answer

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.250 align:middle line:84%
resulting in only
one universe, namely

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:84%
ours, string
theorists have instead

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:84%
proposed that all of
these possibilities

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:84%
are equally probable and
likely exist somewhere

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.180 align:middle line:84%
within a multiverse, meaning
there are at least 10

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.790 align:middle line:84%
to the power 500
differently tuned

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:84%
universes out there in
the multiverse, maybe even

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:90%
infinite numbers.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
But this part, where they say
they're all equally probable

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and all exist, this is the
part where some scientists then

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.020 align:middle line:84%
claim that this
means that there is

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
nothing special about the
fine tuning of our universe.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:84%
We simply find these sets of
parameters in our universe

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:84%
because we can only
exist in a universe that

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:90%
is fine-tuned for life.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
But there are many other types
of universes in the multiverse.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:84%
We are just one possibility
in an infinite sea, nothing

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:90%
special.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, mystery
solved, or not.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Really, all of this
is speculation based

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.795 align:middle line:90%
on assumptions, not evidence.

00:23:35.795 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Riz, what you
just said of deja vu

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.202 align:middle line:84%
emitting from multiverses
makes a lot of sense.

00:23:42.202 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:10%
>>VIRK: Yeah, and, in fact, I
mentioned the science fiction

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:10%
writer Philip K. Dick.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.920 align:middle line:10%
And he made that point,
that he felt like every time

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:10%
they ran the simulation, they
would rewind it and redo it.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And in one instance, he
believed that they prevented

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:84%
JFK's assassination
in Dallas, but then he

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.518 align:middle line:84%
got assassinated in
Orlando or in another city.

00:24:02.518 --> 00:24:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In another city.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: And so they kept going
and they didn't find an outcome

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:90%
that they liked.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So they went back
to the timeline

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.780 align:middle line:84%
where he was
assassinated in Dallas.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this starts to
explain lots of things

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.008 align:middle line:84%
about why we think
we might know what's

00:24:19.008 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:84%
going to happen in the
future and we have hunches

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and intuition, is that we
are inside this multiple set

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:26.870 align:middle line:90%
of universes.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It also explains fine-tuning,
as we saw in the video,

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
because no one knows why the
parameters in our universe

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:90%
are just right for life.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
If it was changed
just a little bit,

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:90%
the planets would fall apart.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.160 align:middle line:90%
The galaxies would fall apart.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out when we
run computer simulations,

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:84%
we run many
different simulations

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and we pick the ones that
are most appropriate.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of a giant
tree going to infinity,

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.760 align:middle line:84%
we prune the tree and then
we merge those possibilities.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And we go forward with the
most interesting possibilities.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that provides a much
better theoretical framework

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:90%
for how fine-tuning might work.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we are not
living in a simulation,

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:90%
what are we living in?

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.237 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:25:10.237 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, if we're not
living in a simulation,

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.530 align:middle line:84%
we have to be living
in a material world.

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing outside
of the material world.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But then all kinds of things,
including ESP, telepathy,

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences, the
afterlife, many of these things

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:84%
can't exist in a
material universe.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the dominant
scientific paradigm,

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:84%
which is why many scientists
resist the idea that any

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:84%
of these topics, which
you explore in your show,

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:90%
would really exist.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've had
scientists tell me

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:84%
that they used to be
atheists, but after thinking

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:84%
about the simulation hypothesis,
now they're agnostic,

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:84%
because to us, anyone who's
outside of the simulation

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.920 align:middle line:84%
would seem to be like
an angel or a god

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
or, as we would call it,
super-users or programmers

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.440 align:middle line:90%
in computer speak.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it kind
of sad to think

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:90%
we're living in a simulation?

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.150 align:middle line:90%
It's got a lonely feeling to it.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: It does, but it depends
on the type of simulation.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, if we were all
just random NPCs--

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
like there's a new movie
this year called "Free Guy"

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.680 align:middle line:84%
with Ryan Reynolds
where he's just an NPC,

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and when they turn
off the simulation,

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:90%
he just kind of disappears.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But if we are players
with characters,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:84%
then we can look at
the challenges in life

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and realize that perhaps
we set up those challenges

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves as ways for us to
level up the soul, if you will.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So the part of us that exists
outside the physical universe

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that we've forgotten about
actually is still watching us

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and is helping us to
make the choices that

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:90%
might lead us a certain way.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's a comfort in
it, because as you said,

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.060 align:middle line:84%
inevitably life comes
with suffering and pain

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and challenges.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we say those are just
random and meaningless pain

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and random,
meaningless challenges,

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:90%
well, that's kind of sad, too.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: On the other hand,
if we're in a simulation,

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.090 align:middle line:84%
we set up those
challenges for ourselves

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.850 align:middle line:90%
as things we can overcome.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it gives us
more confidence to say,

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to
get through this

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:84%
because this is what I set up
for myself despite how hard it

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And my player wanted
to get a level up,

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.190 align:middle line:84%
so he made it really
difficult for me, perhaps.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.810 align:middle line:84%
That's one way to
think about it.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
downside, the downside

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:90%
if we're in a simulation?

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, the downside
is if people say, well,

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:84%
nothing I do here matters
because it's a simulation,

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So what the simulation
hypothesis tells us is this

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.180 align:middle line:84%
may not be the
real world, but it

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that
what we're seeing

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:90%
isn't real within the world.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So while we're here, we
have to take this universe

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
as a real universe, not just
as a simulated universe.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, people would
start to do crazy things

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and use what's called the
"Matrix" defense, which

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.310 align:middle line:84%
is a legal defense that
was used by some kid who

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.627 align:middle line:84%
killed his parents
and said, well, I

00:28:07.627 --> 00:28:08.710 align:middle line:90%
thought I was in a matrix.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So you get the kind
of people who think--

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he didn't
get away with it.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: He didn't
get away with it, no.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that
it's ever actually

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:90%
been used successfully.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But that's the downside of
going too far down that path.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And that works if you're
in the NPC version,

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:84%
if it were just meaningless
non-player characters.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to think
about the type of game

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.260 align:middle line:90%
we're living in.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we're here to be
compassionate towards one

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.005 align:middle line:84%
another and we're here
to get over challenges,

00:28:36.005 --> 00:28:37.380 align:middle line:84%
then that's a very
different type

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of game than being here
to kill each other.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now here's a
new ingredient, mystics

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and how they view, of course,
the nature of reality.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Scientist Gregg Braden talks
about that on our show "Missing

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.340 align:middle line:90%
Links."

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Let's
go back and look

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:84%
at what our most ancient and
cherished spiritual traditions

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.970 align:middle line:84%
from a number of
different religions

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.420 align:middle line:84%
tell us about the
world that we live in.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:84%
They tell us almost universally
that our world has a beginning.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.600 align:middle line:10%
And there are different ideas
about what that beginning is.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But there is a clear beginning
in every religious tradition,

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and that our world will have
an end, that it does not

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:90%
continue forever.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
That is almost a universal
truth throughout the religions,

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and that the events
that are unfolding

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:84%
between that
beginning and that end

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.850 align:middle line:84%
are based on natural
rhythms and cycles.

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Our most cherished
spiritual traditions tell us

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.720 align:middle line:84%
that every life has a
beginning and every life

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.890 align:middle line:90%
must have an end.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.450 align:middle line:90%
They are not perpetual.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.650 align:middle line:84%
They tell us that there are
rules to living in this world

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and that our lives will get
better as we learn those rules.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are different
interpretations

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:84%
of those rules in
different traditions.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are as
common as the golden rule,

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:84%
do unto others as you'd
have them do unto you.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are reflected
in the Ten Commandments

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that tell us about how
to conduct our lives.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And in other
spiritual traditions,

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:84%
in the shamanic traditions
and in the Egyptian mystical

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.200 align:middle line:84%
traditions, they
all give us insights

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.830 align:middle line:84%
into how we live our
lives in this world.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:90%
And here's the key.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Every ancient
spiritual tradition

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:84%
tells us that beyond the
world of our everyday senses

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that we have direct access to
a guidance and the wisdom that

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.850 align:middle line:90%
is not part of this world.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:34.950 align:middle line:84%
We have access to an external
reality or an external guide.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So when we make
these comparisons,

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:84%
except for the language, you
can see the similarities.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
thousands of years

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:84%
ago, our ancestors were
trying to inform us

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.870 align:middle line:84%
in a language of
their time something

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:52.710 align:middle line:84%
that they understood, that we
are only beginning to awaken

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility of
happening in our lives,

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.890 align:middle line:84%
that we are actually
in an artificial world,

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
a temporary world that has
a beginning and an end,

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're learning
something here,

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and that we have access to
an external guidance when

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.360 align:middle line:90%
we need that access?

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.810 align:middle line:84%
We can't tell the real
from the illusion.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
the Sanskrit word "maya,"

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
the word itself, "maya,"
actually means illusion.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:84%
This is a fundamental concept
in the Hindu tradition.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And what I love about the Hindu
tradition is that they tell us

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:33.510 align:middle line:84%
that it is under the illusion,
under maya's influence that

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:84%
the soul identifies
with the body,

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:42.060 align:middle line:84%
to the point where we cannot
tell ourselves as separate from

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.950 align:middle line:84%
the illusion of
this physical world.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Under maya's
influence, we get lost

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:84%
in the body's expressions
of ego and fear, sex, race,

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.225 align:middle line:84%
the color of our skin,
our belief systems.

00:31:54.225 --> 00:31:55.950 align:middle line:90%
It's under the illusion of maya.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And where this
gets really, really

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.930 align:middle line:84%
interesting is in
those same traditions,

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:04.740 align:middle line:84%
the idea of enlightenment
means to escape the maya,

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:90%
to escape the illusion.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Riz, he's pretty
profound, isn't he?

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.418 align:middle line:84%
And I wholeheartedly
agree that what

00:32:13.418 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
all the ancient religions
have been telling

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.870 align:middle line:90%
us is two main points.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:84%
The first is that the
universe that we see

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.270 align:middle line:90%
is not the real world.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And the Hindus say maya.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Within the Buddhist
traditions, they often

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.990 align:middle line:84%
used the metaphor of a
dream, and that we've

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:90%
forgotten about the real world.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
In the Greek
traditions, they talk

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.350 align:middle line:84%
about we cross the
river of forgetfulness

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:90%
when we incarnate.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So we forget what
was there before,

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.980 align:middle line:84%
which is very similar
to this process of being

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:90%
in something like a matrix.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:84%
The second thing they all tell
us is that our actions matter.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And how we treat other
people within the game,

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:90%
that's how we keep score.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:84%
In the Islamic
traditions, there's

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.910 align:middle line:90%
the idea of the Scroll of Deeds.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the Christian traditions,
there's the Book of Life

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:58.470 align:middle line:90%
and the Book of Deeds.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
they have these recording

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:84%
angels who sit there and write
down everything that they do.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.988 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a metaphor, right?

00:33:05.988 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
there are literally

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:11.160 align:middle line:84%
7 billion angels or 14 billion
that are sitting there writing

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:90%
on a physical book.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:84%
At that time they used
the metaphor of the book,

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.970 align:middle line:84%
just as the Buddhists used
the metaphor of a dream world

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.780 align:middle line:90%
and we wake up from the world.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I like to think that if any of
those guys were alive today,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:84%
they would use a
different metaphor.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Just as Shakespeare said the
world's a stage and the men

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and women are merely
players on that stage,

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:35.380 align:middle line:84%
today, they would say all the
world is an interactive video

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.180 align:middle line:90%
game.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And the men and women are
just avatars in this game.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the matrix
explain UFOs and other kinds

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.940 align:middle line:90%
of phenomena like that?

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Yeah, it
gives us a framework

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
for explaining these that
makes a lot more sense

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.320 align:middle line:90%
than the simple material world.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.630 align:middle line:84%
If you look at UFO
reports, there's

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
often a report of an object
materializing out of nowhere.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And when I wrote my book, I
interviewed Jacques Vallee,

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:05.170 align:middle line:84%
who has been investigating this
since the days of Project Blue

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Book.

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that there
were two things that were odd,

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:90%
out of many, in UFO reports.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, one person sees
the UFO and the person standing

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:84%
next to them does
not see the UFO.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And so he believes
there's an element

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:90%
of different consciousness.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:84%
Well, we do this in
video games all the time.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:84%
If you and I are sitting here
but we're really avatars,

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.170 align:middle line:84%
then I'm seeing
it on my computer

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.753 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing
it on your computer.

00:34:29.753 --> 00:34:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm at level two
and you're at level 30,

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:35.250 align:middle line:84%
you might see a UFO
materializing right here,

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:84%
but I can't see it because on
my computer, it's not rendering.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.429 align:middle line:84%
So the servers make
decisions in video games

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:45.659 align:middle line:84%
about who to render what
to based upon their level

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:47.489 align:middle line:84%
and their challenges
and their quests.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.530 align:middle line:84%
He also said that
sometimes UFOs seem

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.300 align:middle line:90%
to go through physical objects--

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and disappear.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: --and disappear.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And in one case, he
said they went right

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.525 align:middle line:90%
through the redwood trees.

00:34:56.525 --> 00:34:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, the trees
were still there.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So, obviously, they
didn't cut the trees.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:84%
How could the UFO have gone
through the redwood trees?

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And then it became a physical
object that actually landed.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you've ever
played a video game,

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.830 align:middle line:84%
you know that as you're
rendering something,

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.360 align:middle line:90%
you can move through walls.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's
finally rendered,

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:18.030 align:middle line:84%
then you have to obey the laws
of physics within the game.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But there's a period of
time where you can de-render

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.140 align:middle line:90%
and you can move objects around.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And so it starts to
explain what appear

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.200 align:middle line:84%
to be these absurd
aspects of UFO sightings.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
artificial intelligence

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.547 align:middle line:90%
fit into this, Riz?

00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, to reach the point
where we can create something

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:37.500 align:middle line:84%
like "The Matrix," one
of the stages I list

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.530 align:middle line:84%
is that we have to be
able to create NPCs that

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:44.250 align:middle line:84%
can pass the Turing Test,
which is a test to if you speak

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:84%
to a computer or a person and
you can't tell the difference,

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.830 align:middle line:84%
then you can say that computer
has passed the Turing Test.

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And so AI is a way to get
characters in the video game.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people would say
that there's an AI controlling

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:59.550 align:middle line:90%
the entire game.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, as
we talked about,

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
having angels
recording our actions

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:07.410 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make sense to have
actual angels doing it.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It would make sense
to have AI that's

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.510 align:middle line:84%
running with rules that's just
recording everything, just

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.340 align:middle line:90%
like we do on our servers.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're even
called daemons, processes

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.050 align:middle line:90%
that run on our servers.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And so AI can be involved
in every aspect of creating

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and maintaining the
world, rather than

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.250 align:middle line:84%
having to create every little
thing from the game's creators.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.250 align:middle line:84%
The game's creators
create the AIs, which

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:90%
then allow us to play the game.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could the Bible
have been making reference

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to the way creator who was
developing this matrix?

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: I think so.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.940 align:middle line:84%
The Bible tells us
that in the beginning,

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:84%
God says, "Let there
be light," right?

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And that light
really is the essence

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.030 align:middle line:90%
of the physical universe.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think
about a computer game,

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.800 align:middle line:84%
you turn it on by turning
on the electricity.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:90%
What is electricity?

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.040 align:middle line:90%
It's electromagnetic radiation.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.310 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be the one
constant in the universe,

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:84%
is the speed of
light and the fact

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:84%
that light is at the
base of everything.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And so it sounds more
like a video game

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.900 align:middle line:90%
than a physical reality.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible also tells us that
our actions are being recorded

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
these entities there

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:84%
that are watching us and
they're there to help us.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
the traditions which

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.490 align:middle line:84%
tell us to pray, who is
it that we're praying to?

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.950 align:middle line:84%
We're praying to entities
that are watching us

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.353 align:middle line:90%
from outside the simulation.

00:37:33.353 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:84%
If you remember
there was a movie,

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.027 align:middle line:84%
"Bruce Almighty," I
think, with Jim Carrey--

00:37:37.027 --> 00:37:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jim Carrey.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.677 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: --where God
gave him his powers

00:37:39.677 --> 00:37:41.010 align:middle line:90%
and he just got in his computer.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.750 align:middle line:84%
He could see a list
of all the prayers

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that were coming through,
right, which is maybe a better

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.732 align:middle line:90%
metaphor than it first looks.

00:37:46.732 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe it
happens that way.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.148 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: You never know.

00:37:49.148 --> 00:37:51.272 align:middle line:84%
All this information has
to be stored somewhere.

00:37:51.272 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Researcher
and author David Icke

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.950 align:middle line:84%
talked about
technology that could

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.030 align:middle line:90%
be mimicking our own reality.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said this on Gaia's
"Escape the Matrix" show.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID ICKE: So the question
then comes, obviously--

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:19.950 align:middle line:84%
what is all this computer-like,
virtual-reality-like encoding

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.530 align:middle line:90%
doing in our reality?

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I say it's
because what we're

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:31.820 align:middle line:84%
seeing with technology
as it advances

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:37.850 align:middle line:84%
so fast now is
technology mimicking

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:46.430 align:middle line:84%
reality, because our reality
is simulated in some way

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:50.690 align:middle line:90%
by a form of technology.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:38:53.950 --> 00:39:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's been my view
for quite a long time

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:06.380 align:middle line:84%
now that the idea that
the speed of light

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.940 align:middle line:84%
is the fastest speed
possible, though it's

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.090 align:middle line:84%
become a basic tenet
of mainstream science,

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.600 align:middle line:90%
I say that's a nonsense, that--

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we live in
an infinite reality

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:84%
that is all possibility
and all potential.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So you can't have a fastest
speed within all possibility,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.110 align:middle line:84%
because all possibility
is all possibility.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.850 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:47.064 align:middle line:84%
And I say that what
the speed of light is

00:39:47.064 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
is the limit, the firewall
of the simulation.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they found that when
you get closer and closer

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to the speed of
light, things start

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:06.610 align:middle line:84%
to go strange, start to act
differently, react differently.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And things that
work a certain way

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:17.320 align:middle line:84%
within the reality
in general starts

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.780 align:middle line:84%
to change when it gets
to the speed of light.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:27.420 align:middle line:84%
My view is that
this is happening

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.580 align:middle line:84%
because it's entering
the outer limits

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.460 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
simulated reality.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.737 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it starts
to act differently.

00:40:38.737 --> 00:40:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do
you think of that?

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.420 align:middle line:84%
In a roundabout way,
he, too, is talking

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.288 align:middle line:90%
about a simulated reality.

00:40:44.288 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And he's been talking
about this for a while.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think we agree that
the physical world is

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:54.870 align:middle line:84%
starting to look more and
more like information.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:56.565 align:middle line:84%
You've probably
heard of 3D printers.

00:40:56.565 --> 00:40:57.482 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:40:57.482 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: And 3D printers can
be used to print an object,

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.280 align:middle line:90%
even print a scale model--

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm still amazed
by 3D printers, by the way.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Right, and you can
print a model of a car.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
they're now printing

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.580 align:middle line:90%
scale models of the heart--

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And body parts.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: --and body parts using
actual cells from the person.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: And so the further we go
down that path, the further we

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:26.730 align:middle line:84%
realize that there is a blurring
between what is information

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.438 align:middle line:90%
and what is a physical object.

00:41:28.438 --> 00:41:29.730 align:middle line:90%
If you remember in "Star Trek--

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:32.520 align:middle line:84%
The Next Generation," Captain
Picard would go and say,

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.900 align:middle line:90%
"Tea, Earl Grey, hot."

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And it would render
the physical cup

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.800 align:middle line:90%
and it would render the tea.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Those are two different
sets of atoms,

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.240 align:middle line:84%
but they would be
rendered by one printer.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we are now
getting to the point

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.490 align:middle line:84%
where we can have
different types of material

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:48.370 align:middle line:90%
and to print them.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And within a decade
or two, we'll

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.910 align:middle line:84%
be able to have replicators like
the "Star Trek" replicators.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
going too fast, Riz?

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Are we going too fast
with this technology?

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, we're going
faster than we used to go.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that it's going
to take longer than people

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.590 align:middle line:84%
assume for artificial
intelligence

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.540 align:middle line:90%
to reach that critical point.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything else, I think,
is moving pretty fast,

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.820 align:middle line:90%
whether it's the resolution.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:18.270 align:middle line:84%
If you watch special effects
on movies now, they blend in

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.980 align:middle line:90%
and they look very realistic.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.720 align:middle line:84%
If you look at 3D
printers, you look

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:84%
at augmented and
virtual reality,

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.190 align:middle line:84%
things are moving
pretty quickly.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But that's just a part
of the information age

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:29.970 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
If we lived 100
years ago, you might

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.310 align:middle line:84%
ask the same question about
are there too many machines?

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Are these machines
being built too fast?

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:41.790 align:middle line:84%
The telephone and the telegraph
and the radio, so much change

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:42.720 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.360 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, that was
an even bigger change

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:84%
than what we're
going through today,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
even though our advances
tend to come more quickly.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The book,
"Simulated Multiverse."

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Yeah, so
that's the new book.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And the subtitle is "An MIT
Computer Scientist Explores

00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Parallel Universes, the
Simulation Hypothesis,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and the Mandela Effect."

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And that'll be
ready in this fall.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And the idea there
is that you may

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:13.260 align:middle line:84%
have people who remember events
differently than other people.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's become
popularly known as the Mandela

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:17.170 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea of the new book
is that this might be evidence

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:24.090 align:middle line:84%
that we are actually not
just in a simulated universe,

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.870 align:middle line:84%
but in a simulated multiverse,
with many different timelines.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:28.723 align:middle line:90%
And time itself--

00:43:28.723 --> 00:43:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And outcomes.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: What's that?

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.690 align:middle line:90%
And outcomes.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:31.607 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And outcomes.

00:43:31.607 --> 00:43:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Exactly, which means
that there was a version of us,

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.230 align:middle line:84%
there's a version of you
and that are maybe not

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:38.550 align:middle line:90%
having this conversation here.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.590 align:middle line:84%
We're having it somewhere
else, but that there

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:42.690 align:middle line:84%
are an infinite set
of possibilities.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And actually, quantum
physics tells us

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.610 align:middle line:84%
that not only does
the observer effect

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:84%
apply to something like a cat,
but it can apply to the past.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of light
coming from a galaxy that's

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.450 align:middle line:84%
a million light years
away and there's

00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:59.160 align:middle line:84%
a black hole in
the middle that's

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.200 align:middle line:84%
about 1,000 light
years away from us,

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.270 align:middle line:84%
the light has to go to
the left or the right

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:04.470 align:middle line:90%
of that black hole.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:08.850 align:middle line:84%
That decision has to have
been made 1,000 years ago,

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.940 align:middle line:84%
because the black hole is
1,000 light years away.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.858 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The secret is who's
the creator of the matrix?

00:44:14.858 --> 00:44:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: Well, that's
a big question, right?

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's us.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Why do we play video games?

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.195 align:middle line:84%
We play video games
to have experiences

00:44:24.195 --> 00:44:25.320 align:middle line:90%
that we can't have outside.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To escape.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: To escape,
that's one reason.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I can't fly on a
dragon and shoot

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:33.587 align:middle line:84%
at orcs in this
physical reality,

00:44:33.587 --> 00:44:34.920 align:middle line:90%
but I can do it in a video game.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, the question is, what
experiences can we have here

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.330 align:middle line:10%
that perhaps our souls
can't have outside

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.040 align:middle line:10%
of this simulated reality?

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.680 align:middle line:10%
And the answer might be
physical experiences,

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.780 align:middle line:10%
because if it's
pure consciousness

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.020 align:middle line:10%
outside this reality, then
they can't have the suffering

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.350 align:middle line:10%
that we're having here.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:56.190 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why the pain
and suffering may actually

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:59.160 align:middle line:10%
be a key part of
this simulation,

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.400 align:middle line:10%
as well as the ability to
make those choices that

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.828 align:middle line:10%
might lead us down
the wrong path

00:45:03.828 --> 00:45:05.370 align:middle line:10%
or might lead us
down the right path.

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.080 align:middle line:90%
What's your website, Riz?

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRK: So my website
is zenentrepreneur.com.

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you can find
links to all of my books.

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRK: Absolutely.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me on.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:17.610 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoyed it.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.277 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A lot of
experts say that we're

00:45:19.277 --> 00:45:20.850 align:middle line:10%
living in a simulated world.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.960 align:middle line:10%
If we are, what does
that mean to our future?

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
